            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction The neurologic system, the body's communications network,\\ncoordinates and organizes the functions of all body systems. This intricate network has three main divisions: central nervous system (CNS): the control center, made up of the brain, the brain stem, and the spinal cord peripheral nervous system: motor and sensory nerves that connect the CNS to remote body parts and relay and receive messages from them autonomic nervous system (part of the peripheral nervous system): regulates involuntary functioning of the internal organs and vascular system. Fundamental unit The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron,\\na highly specialized conductor cell that receives and transmits electrochemical nerve impulses. Its structure contains delicate, threadlike nerve fibers that extend from the central cell body and transmit signals: axons, which carry impulses away from the cell body, and dendrites, which carry impulses to it. Most neurons have multiple dendrites but only one axon. Sensory (afferent) neurons transmit impulses from special receptors to the spinal cord or the brain, motor (efferent) neurons transmit impulses from the CNS to regulate activity of muscles or glands, and interneurons (connecting or association neurons) shuttle signals through complex pathways between sensory and motor neurons. Interneurons account for 99% of all the neurons in the nervous system and include most of the neurons in the brain. (See Structure of the neuron .) Intricate control system This intricate network of interlocking receptors and transmitters forms, together with the brain and spinal cord, a dynamic control system\\u2014a living computer\\u2014that controls and regulates every mental and physical function. From birth to death, this astonishing system efficiently organizes the body's affairs\\u2014controlling the smallest\\naction, thought, or feeling; monitoring communication and instinct for survival; and allowing introspection, wonder, abstract thought, and awareness of one's own intelligence. The brain, the primary center of the CNS, is the large soft mass of nervous tissue housed in the cranium and protected and supported by the meninges and skull bones. STRUCTURE OF THE NEURON The basic structure of the neuron is composed of the cell body, axon, and dendrites, as depicted below. The fragile brain, brain stem, and spinal cord are protected by bone (the skull and vertebrae), cushioning cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and three protective membranes, called meninges: P The dura mater, or outer sheath, is made of tough white fibrous tissue. The arachnoid membrane, the middle layer, is delicate and lacelike. The pia mater, the inner meningeal layer, is made of fine blood vessels held together by connective tissue. It's thin and transparent and clings to the brain and spinal cord surfaces, carrying branches of the cerebral arteries deep into the brain's fissures and sulci. Between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane is the subdural space; between the pia mater and the arachnoid membrane is the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space and the brain's four ventricles contain CSF, a clear liquid containing water and traces of organic materials (especially protein), glucose, and minerals. CSF is formed from blood in capillary networks called choroid plexus, which are located primarily in the brain's lateral ventricles. This fluid is eventually reabsorbed into the venous blood through the arachnoid villi, in dural sinuses on the brain's surface. The cerebrum, the largest portion of the brain, is the nerve center that controls sensory and motor activities and intelligence. The outer layer of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex, consists of neuron cell bodies (gray matter); the inner layers consist of axons (white matter) and basal ganglia, which control motor coordination and steadiness. The\\ncerebral surface is deeply convoluted, furrowed with elevations (gyri) and depressions (sulci). A longitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum into two hemispheres connected by a wide band of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum, through which the hemispheres share information. The hemispheres don't share equally; one always dominates, giving one side control over the other. Because motor impulses descending from the brain through the pyramidal tract cross in the medulla, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body; the left hemisphere, the right side of the body. Several fissures divide the cerebrum into lobes, each of which is associated with specific functions. (See A look at the lobes .) The thalamus, a relay center below the corpus callosum, further organizes cerebral function by transmitting impulses to and from appropriate areas of the cerebrum. In addition to its primary relay function, it's responsible for primitive emotional responses, such as fear, and for distinguishing pleasant stimuli from unpleasant ones. The hypothalamus, which lies beneath the thalamus, is an autonomic center that has connections with the brain, spinal cord, autonomic nervous system, and pituitary gland. It regulates temperature control, appetite, blood pressure, breathing, sleep patterns, and peripheral nerve discharges that occur with behavioral and emotional expression. It also has partial control of pituitary gland secretion and stress reaction. The base of the brain Beneath the cerebrum, at the base of the brain, is the cerebellum. It's responsible for smooth muscle movements, coordinating sensory impulses with muscle activity, and maintaining muscle tone and equilibrium. The brain stem houses cell bodies for most of the cranial nerves and includes the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. With the thalamus and the hypothalamus, it makes up a nerve network called the reticular formation, which acts as an arousal mechanism and controls wakefulness. It also relays nerve impulses between the spinal cord and other parts of the brain. The midbrain is the reflex center for the third and fourth cranial nerves and mediates pupillary reflexes and eye movements. The pons helps regulate respirations; it's also the reflex center for the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and mediates chewing, taste, saliva secretion, hearing, and equilibrium. The medulla oblongata affects cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotor functions. Bloodline to the brain Four major arteries\\u2014two vertebral and two carotid\\u2014supply the brain with oxygenated blood. These arteries originate in or near the\\naortic arch. The two vertebral arteries (branches of the subclavian) converge to become the basilar artery, which supplies the posterior brain. The common carotids branch into the two internal carotids, which divide further to supply the anterior brain and the middle brain. These arteries interconnect through the Circle of Willis, at the base of the brain. This anastomosis usually ensures continual circulation to the brain. P The spinal cord: Conductor pathway Extending downward from the brain through the vertebrae, to the level of approximately the second lumbar vertebra, is the spinal cord, a two- way conductor pathway between the brain stem and the peripheral nervous system. The spinal cord is also the reflex center for\\nactivities that don't require brain control, such as deep tendon reflexes, the jerking reaction elicited by tapping with a reflex hammer. A LOOK AT THE LOBES Several fissures divide the cerebrum into hemispheres and lobes; each lobe has a specific function. The fissure of Sylvius (lateral sulcus) separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes. The fissure of Rolando (central sulcus) separates the frontal lobes from the parietal lobe. The parieto-occipital fissure separates the occipital lobe from the two parietal lobes. The frontal lobe controls voluntary muscle movements and contains motor areas (including\\nthe motor area for speech, or Broca's area). It's the center for personality, behavioral, and intellectual functions, such as judgment, memory, and problem solving; for autonomic functions; and for cardiac and emotional responses. The temporal lobe is the center for taste, hearing, and smell, and in the brain's dominant hemisphere, it interprets spoken language. The parietal lobe coordinates and interprets sensory information from the opposite side of the body. The occipital lobe interprets visual stimuli. A cross section of the spinal cord shows an internal H-shaped mass of gray matter divided into horns, which consist primarily\\nof neuron cell bodies. (See Cross section of the spinal cord, page 168.)\\nCell bodies in P the posterior, or dorsal, horn primarily relay sensations; those in the anterior, or ventral, horn are needed for voluntary or reflex motor activity. The white matter surrounding the outer part of these horns consists of myelinated nerve fibers grouped functionally in vertical columns, called tracts .\\nThe sensory, or ascending, tracts carry sensory impulses up the spinal cord to the brain; the motor, or descending, tracts carry motor impulses\\ndown the spinal cord. The brain's motor impulses reach a descending tract and continue through the peripheral nervous system via upper motor\\nneurons. These neurons originate in the brain and form two major systems: CROSS SECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD The cross section of the spinal cord below shows the anterior and posterior segments. The pyramidal system (corticospinal tract) is responsible for fine, skilled movements of skeletal muscle. An impulse in this system originates in the frontal lobe's motor cortex and travels downward to P the pyramids of the medulla,\\nwhere it crosses to the opposite side of the spinal cord. The extrapyramidal system (extracorticospinal tract) controls gross motor movements. An impulse traveling in this system originates in the frontal lobe's motor cortex and is mediated by basal ganglia, the thalamus, cerebellum, and reticular formation before descending to the spinal cord. Outlying areas Messages transmitted through the spinal cord reach outlying areas through the peripheral nervous system, which originates in 31 pairs of segmentally arranged spinal nerves attached to the spinal\\ncord. Spinal nerves are numbered according to their point of origin in the cord: 8 cervical: C1 to C8 12 thoracic: T1 to T12 5 lumbar: L1 to L5 5 sacral: S1 to S5 1 coccygeal. On the cross section of the spinal cord, you'll see that these spinal nerves are attached to the spinal cord by two roots: The anterior, or ventral, root consists of motor fibers that relay impulses from the cord to glands and muscles. The posterior, or dorsal, root consists of sensory fibers that relay sensory information from receptors to the cord. The posterior root has an enlarged area\\u2014the posterior root ganglion\\u2014which is made up of sensory neuron cell bodies. After leaving the vertebral column, each spinal nerve separates into rami (branches), distributed peripherally, with extensive but organized overlapping. This overlapping reduces the chance of lost sensory or motor function from interruption of a single spinal nerve. Two functional systems The somatic (voluntary) nervous system is activated by will but can also function independently. It's responsible for all conscious and higher mental processes and for subconscious and reflex actions such as shivering. The autonomic (involuntary) nervous system regulates unconscious processes to control involuntary body functions, such as digestion, respiration, and cardiovascular function. It's usually divided into two competing systems: The sympathetic nervous system controls energy expenditure, especially in stressful situations, by releasing adrenergic catecholamines. The parasympathetic nervous system helps conserve energy by releasing the cholinergic neurohormone acetylcholine. These systems balance each other to support homeostasis under normal conditions. Assessing neurologic function A complete neurologic assessment helps confirm the diagnosis when a neurologic disorder is suspected. It establishes a clinical baseline and can offer lifesaving clues to rapid deterioration.\\nNeurologic assessment includes: Patient history: In addition to the usual information, try to elicit the patient's and his family's perception of the disorder. Use the patient interview to make observations that help evaluate mental status and behavior. Physical examination: Pay particular attention to obvious abnormalities that may signal serious neurologic problems; for example, fluid draining from the nose or ears. Check for these significant symptoms: \\u2013 headaches, especially if they're more severe in the morning, wake the patient, or the pain is unusually intense \\u2013 change in visual acuity, especially sudden change \\u2013 numbness or tingling in one or more extremities \\u2013 clumsiness or complete loss of function in an extremity \\u2013 mood swings or personality changes \\u2013 any change in seizures. Neurologic examination: Determine cerebral, cerebellar, motor, sensory, and cranial nerve function. Obviously, there isn't always time for a complete neurologic examination during bedside assessment. It's therefore necessary to select priorities; for example, typical bedside assessment focuses on level of consciousness, pupillary response, motor function, reflexes, sensory functions, and vital signs. However, when time permits, a complete neurologic examination can provide valuable information regarding total neurologic function. Assessing mental status, intellect, and behavior Mental status and behavior are good indicators of cerebral function, and they're easy to assess. Note the patient's appearance, mannerisms, posture, facial expression, grooming, and tone of voice. Check for orientation to time, place, and person and for memory of recent and past events. To test intellect, ask the patient to count backward from 100 by 7s, to read aloud, or to interpret a common proverb, and see how well he understands and follows commands. To assesses executive function, ask the patient to follow a series of commands. If you make such checks frequently, vary the questions to avoid a programmed response. Assessing level of consciousness Level of consciousness (LOC) is a valuable indicator of neurologic function. It can vary from alertness (response to verbal stimulus) to coma (failure to respond even to painful stimulus). Document the patient's exact response to the stimulus; for example, write, \\u201cPatient pulled away in response to nail bed pressure,\\u201d rather than a simple adjective like \\u201cstuporous.\\u201d The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which assesses eye opening as well as verbal and motor responses, provides a quick, standardized account of neurologic status. In this test, each response receives a numerical value. (See Glasgow Coma Scale, page 170.)\\nFor instance, if the patient readily P responds verbally and is oriented to time, place, and person, he scores a 5; if he's completely unable to respond verbally, he scores a 1. If the patient is intubated or has a tracheostomy, assess and score accordingly, such as 5/T (\\u2018T\\u2019 meaning tracheostomy). A score of 15 for all three parts is normal; 7 or less indicates coma; 3\\u2014the lowest score possible \\u2014generally (but not always) indicates brain death. Although the GCS is useful, it isn't a substitute for a complete neurologic assessment. GLASGOW COMA SCALE To quickly assess a patient's level of consciousness and to uncover baseline changes, use the Glasgow Coma Scale. This assessment\\ntool grades consciousness in relation to eye opening and motor and verbal responses. A decreased reaction score in one or more categories warns of an impending neurologic crisis. A patient scoring 7 or less is comatose and probably has severe neurologic damage. Test Patient's reaction Score Best eye opening response Open spontaneously 4 Open to verbal command 3 Open to pain 2 No response 1 Best motor response Obeys verbal command 6 Localizes painful stimuli 5 Flexion-withdrawal 4 Flexion-abnormal (decorticate rigidity) 3 Extension (decerebrate rigidity) 2 P No response 1 Best verbal response Oriented and converses 5 Disoriented and converses 4 Inappropriate words 3 Incomprehensible sounds 2 No response 1 Total 3 to 15 Assessing motor function The inability to perform the following simple tests, or the presence of tics, tremors, or other abnormalities during such testing, suggests cerebellar dysfunction. Ask the patient to touch his nose with each index finger, alternating hands. Repeat this test with his eyes closed. Instruct the patient to tap the index finger and thumb of each hand together rapidly. Have the patient draw a figure eight in the air with his foot. To test tandem walk, ask the patient to walk heel to toe in a straight line. To test balance, perform the Romberg test:\\nAsk the patient to stand with feet together, eyes closed, and arms outstretched without losing balance. Motor function is a good indicator of LOC and can also point to central or peripheral nervous system damage. During all tests of motor function, watch for differences between right and left side functions. To check gait, ask the patient to walk while you observe posture, balance, and coordination of leg movement and arm swing. To check muscle tone, palpate muscles at rest and in response to passive flexion. Look for flaccidity, spasticity, and rigidity. Measure muscle size, and look for involuntary movements, such as rapid jerks, tremors, or contractions. To evaluate muscle strength, have the patient grip your hands and squeeze. Then ask him to push against your palm with his foot. Compare muscle strength on each side, using a 5-point scale (5 is normal strength, 0 is complete paralysis). Also test\\nthe patient's ability to extend and flex the neck, elbows, wrists, fingers, toes, hips, and knees; to extend the spine; to contract and relax the abdominal muscles; and to rotate the shoulders. Rate reflexes on a 4-point scale (4 is clonus, 0 is absent reflex). Before testing reflexes, make sure that the\\npatient is comfortable and relaxed. Then, to test superficial reflexes,\\nstroke the skin of the abdominal, gluteal, plantar, and scrotal regions\\nwith a moderately sharp object that won't puncture the skin. (Don't use\\nthe same pin to test another patient.) A normal response to this stimulus is flexion. To test deep reflexes, use a reflex hammer to briskly tap the biceps, the triceps, and the brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles tendon regions. A normal response is rapid extension and contraction. Assessing sensory function Impaired or absent sensation in the trunk or extremities can point to brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerve damage. Determining\\nthe extent of sensory dysfunction is important because it helps locate neurologic damage. For instance, localized dysfunction indicates local peripheral nerve damage, dysfunction over a single dermatome (an area served by 1 of the 31 pairs of spinal nerves) indicates damage to the nerve's dorsal root, and dysfunction extending over more than one dermatome suggests brain or spinal cord damage. In assessing sensory function, always test both sides of symmetrical areas\\u2014for instance, both arms, not just one. Reassure the patient that the test won't be painful. Superficial pain perception: Lightly press the point of an open safety pin against the patient's skin. Don't press hard enough to scratch the skin. Discard pin after use. P Thermal sensitivity: The patient tells what he feels when you place a test tube filled with hot water and one filled with cold water against his skin. Tactile sensitivity: Ask the patient to close his eyes and tell you what he feels when touched lightly on hands, wrists, arms, thighs, lower legs, feet, and trunk with a wisp of cotton. Sensitivity to vibration: Place the base of a vibrating tuning fork against the patient's wrists,\\nelbows, knees, or other bony prominences. Hold it in place, and ask the\\npatient to tell you when it stops vibrating. Position sense: Hold the lateral medial portion of the patient's fingers and toes and move them up, down, and to the side. Ask the patient to tell you the direction of movement. Discriminatory sensation: Ask the patient to close his eyes and identify familiar textures (velvet or burlap) or objects placed in his hand or numbers and letters traced on his palm. Two-point discrimination: Using calipers or other sharp objects, touch the patient in two different places simultaneously. Ask if he can feel one or two points. Record how many millimeters of separation are required for the patient to feel two points. Assessing cranial nerve function By using the simple tests that follow, you can reliably localize cranial nerve dysfunction. Olfactory nerve (I): Have the patient close his eyes and, using each nostril separately, try\\nto identify common nonirritating smells, such as cinnamon, coffee, or peppermint. Optic nerve (II): Examine the patient's eyes with an ophthalmoscope, and have him read a Snellen eye chart or a newspaper. To test peripheral vision, ask him to cover one eye and fix his other eye on a point directly in front of him.\\nThen, ask if he can see you wiggle your finger in the four quadrants; you'd expect him to see your finger in all four. Oculomotor nerve (III): Compare the size and shape of the patient's pupils and the equality of pupillary response to a small light in a darkened room. Shine the light from a lateral position, not directly in front of the patient's eyes. Trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI): To assess for conjugate and lateral eye movement, ask the patient to follow your finger with his eyes as you slowly move it from his far left\\nto his far right. Trigeminal nerve (V): To test all three portions of this cranial nerve, test facial sensation\\nby stroking the patient's jaws, cheeks, and forehead with a cotton swab, the point of a pin, or test tubes filled with hot or cold water. Because testing for a blink reflex is irritating to the patient, it's not commonly done. If you must test for this response (it may be decreased in patients who wear contact lenses), touch the cornea lightly\\nwith a wisp of cotton or tissue, and avoid repeating the test, if possible. To test for jaw jerk, ask the patient to hold his mouth slightly open; then tap the middle of his chin lightly with a reflex hammer. The jaw should jerk closed. Facial nerve (VII): To test upper and lower facial motor function, ask the patient to raise\\nhis eyebrows, close his eyes, wrinkle his forehead, and show his teeth.\\nTo test sense of taste, ask him to identify the taste of salty, sour, sweet, and bitter substances, which you have placed on his tongue. Acoustic nerve (VIII): Ask the patient to identify common sounds such as a ticking clock. With a tuning fork, test for air and bone conduction. Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX): To test gag reflex, touch a tongue blade to each side of the patient's pharynx. Vagus nerve (X): Observe ability to swallow, and watch for symmetrical movements of soft palate when the patient says, \\u201cAh.\\u201d Spinal accessory nerve (XI): To test shoulder muscle strength, palpate the patient's shoulders, and ask him to shrug against a resistance. Hypoglossal nerve (XII): To test tongue movement, ask the patient to stick out his tongue. Inspect it for tremor, atrophy, or lateral deviation. To test for strength, ask the patient to move his tongue from side to side while you\\nhold a tongue blade against it. P Testing for a firm diagnosis A firm diagnosis of many neurologic disorders usually requires a wide range of diagnostic tests\\u2014both noninvasive and invasive.\\nNoninvasive tests are done first and may include the following: Skull X-ray identifies skull malformations, fractures, erosion, or thickening. Changes in landmarks may indicate a space-occupying lesion. Computed tomography (CT) scan produces three-dimensional images that can identify hemorrhage, intracranial tumors, malformation, and cerebral atrophy, edema, calcification, and infarction. If a contrast medium is used, the procedure is invasive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) views the\\nCNS in greater detail than a CT scan and is the procedure of choice for\\ndetecting multiple sclerosis; intraluminal clots and blood flow in arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms; brain stem, posterior fossa, and spinal cord lesions; early cerebral infarction; and brain tumors. A noniodinated contrast medium may be used to enhance lesions. Advances in\\nMRI allow visualization of cerebral arteries and venous sinuses without\\nadministration of a contrast medium. EEG detects abnormal electrical activity in the brain (for example, from a seizure, metabolic disorder, or drug overdose). Ultrasonography detects carotid lesions or\\nchanges in carotid blood flow and velocity. High-frequency sound waves reflect back the velocity of blood flow, which is then reported as a graphic recording of a waveform. Evoked potentials evaluate the visual, auditory, and somatosensory nerve pathways by measuring the brain's electrical response to stimulation of the sensory organs or peripheral nerves. Invasive tests may include the following: In lumbar puncture, a needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, usually between L3 and L4 (or L4 and L5). This allows aspiration of CSF for analysis to detect infection or hemorrhage; to determine cell count and glucose, protein, and globulin levels; and to measure CSF pressure. Lumbar puncture is usually contraindicated in hydrocephalus and in increased intracranial pressure (ICP) because a quick pressure reduction\\nmay cause brain herniation. (See What happens in increased ICP, page 174.) Myelography follows a lumbar puncture and CSF removal. In this procedure, a radiologic dye is instilled and X-rays\\nshow spinal abnormalities and determine spinal cord compression related\\nto back pain or extremity weakness. In cerebral arteriography, also known as angiography, a catheter is inserted into an artery\\u2014usually the femoral artery\\u2014and is\\nthreaded up to the carotid artery. Then a radiopaque dye is injected, allowing X- ray visualization of the cerebral vasculature. Sometimes the catheter is threaded directly into the brachial or carotid artery. This test can show cerebrovascular abnormalities and spasms plus arterial changes due to a tumor, arteriosclerosis, hemorrhage, an aneurysm, or blockage. A patient undergoing this procedure is at risk for a stroke and for increased ICP. Digital subtraction angiography visualizes\\ncerebral vessels using contrast medium administered I.V., after which computer-assisted precontrast and postcontrast images are compared. The first image is \\u201csubtracted\\u201d from the second, which highlights the cerebral vessels. Brain scan measures gamma rays produced by\\na radioisotope injected I.V. Uptake and distribution of the isotope in the brain highlights intracranial masses, vascular lesions, and other problems. ICP monitoring can be a direct, invasive method of identifying trends in ICP. A subarachnoid screw and an intraventricular catheter convert CSF pressure readings into waveforms that are displayed digitally on an oscilloscope monitor. Another method uses a fiber-optic catheter inserted in the subdural space; with this indirect method, pressure changes are reported digitally or in waveform. Electromyography detects lower motor neuron disorders, neuromuscular disorders, and nerve damage. A needle inserted into selected muscles at rest and during voluntary contraction picks up nerve impulses and measures nerve conduction time. CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Cerebral palsy The most common cause of crippling in children, cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neuromuscular disorders resulting from prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal CNS damage. Although nonprogressive, these disorders may become more obvious as an affected infant grows older. Three major types of CP occur\\u2014spastic, athetoid, and ataxic\\u2014sometimes in mixed forms. Motor impairment may be minimal (sometimes apparent only during physical activities such as running) or severely disabling. Associated defects, such as seizures, speech disorders, and mental retardation, are common. The prognosis varies; in cases of mild impairment, proper treatment may make a near-normal life possible. Causes and incidence See Causes of cerebral palsy , page 175,\\nfor a more detailed description of the causes of CP. Incidence is slightly higher in premature neonates (anoxia plays the greatest role in\\ncontributing to CP) and in neonates who are small for their gestational\\nage. CP is slightly more common in males than in females. For every 1,000 births, 2 to 4 neonates are affected. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of CP, affecting about 50% of CP patients. Athetoid cerebral palsy affects about 20% of CP patients, ataxic cerebral palsy accounts for another 10%\\nof these patients, and the remaining 20% of patients are mixed, with a combination of symptoms. Complications Seizure disorder Injuries from falls Speech, vision, and hearing problems P Language and perception deficits Respiratory problems (poor swallowing and gag reflexes) Dental problems Mental retardation PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN INCREASED ICP Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted within the intact skull by the intracranial volume\\u2014about 10% blood, 10% cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 80% brain tissue water. The rigid skull allows very little space for expansion of these substances. When ICP increases to pathologic levels, brain damage can result. The brain compensates for increases in ICP by regulating the volumes of the three substances in the following ways: limiting blood flow to the head displacing CSF into the spinal canal increasing absorption or decreasing production of CSF\\u2014 withdrawing water from brain tissue into the blood and excreting it through the kidneys. When compensatory mechanisms become overworked, small changes in volume lead to large changes in pressure. The chart at right will help you understand the pathophysiology of increased ICP. P Signs and symptoms Spastic cerebral palsy is characterized by hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, increased stretch reflexes, rapid alternating muscle contraction and relaxation, muscle weakness, underdevelopment of affected limbs, muscle contraction in response to manipulation, and a tendency to contractures. Typically, a child with spastic CP walks on his toes with a scissors gait, crossing one foot in front of the other. In athetoid cerebral palsy, involuntary movements\\u2014grimacing, wormlike writhing, dystonia, and sharp jerks\\u2014impair\\nvoluntary movement. Usually, these involuntary movements affect the arms more severely than the legs; involuntary facial movements may make speech difficult. These athetoid movements become more severe during stress, decrease with relaxation, and disappear entirely during sleep. Ataxic cerebral palsy is characterized by disturbed balance, incoordination (especially of the arms), hypoactive reflexes, nystagmus, muscle weakness, tremor, lack of leg movement during infancy,\\nand a widebased gait as the child begins to walk. Ataxia makes sudden or fine movements almost impossible. Some children with CP display a combination of these clinical features. In most, impaired motor function makes eating (especially swallowing) difficult and retards growth and development. Up\\nto 40% of these children are mentally retarded, about 25% have seizure disorders, and about 80% have impaired speech. Many also have dental abnormalities, vision and hearing defects, and reading disabilities. Diagnosis Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and requires precise neurologic assessment and careful clinical observation during infancy. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging can reveal structural or congenital abnormalities. Suspect CP whenever an infant: CAUSES OF CEREBRAL PALSY Conditions that result in cerebral anoxia, hemorrhage, or other damage are probably responsible for cerebral palsy. P Prenatal conditions that may increase risk\\nof CP: maternal infection (especially rubella), maternal drug ingestion, radiation, anoxia, toxemia, maternal diabetes, abnormal placental attachment, malnutrition, and isoimmunization Perinatal and birth difficulties that increase the risk of CP: forceps delivery, breech presentation, placenta previa, abruptio placentae, metabolic or electrolyte disturbances, abnormal maternal vital signs from general or spinal anesthetic, prolapsed cord with delay in delivery of head, premature birth, prolonged or unusually rapid labor, and multiple birth (especially infants born last in a multiple birth) Infection or trauma during infancy: poisoning, severe kernicterus resulting from erythroblastosis fetalis, brain infection, head trauma, prolonged anoxia, brain tumor, cerebral circulatory anomalies causing blood vessel rupture, and systemic disease\\nresulting in cerebral thrombosis or embolus has difficulty sucking or keeping the nipple or food in his mouth seldom moves voluntarily or has arm or leg tremors with voluntary movement crosses his legs when lifted from behind rather than pulling them up or \\u201cbicycling\\u201d like a normal infant has legs that are difficult to separate, making diaper changing difficult persistently uses only one hand or, as he gets older, uses hands well but not legs. Infants at particular risk include those with low birth weight, low Apgar scores at 5 minutes, seizures, and metabolic disturbances. However, all infants should have a screening test for CP as a regular part of their 6-month checkup. Treatment CP can't be cured, but proper treatment can help affected\\nchildren reach their full potential within the limitations set by this disorder. Such treatment requires a comprehensive and cooperative effort\\ninvolving physicians, nurses, teachers, psychologists, the child's family, and occupational, physical, and speech therapists. Home care is usually possible. Treatment usually includes interventions that encourage optimum development: Braces or splints and special appliances, such as adapted eating utensils and a low toilet seat with arms, help these children perform activities independently. An artificial urinary sphincter may be indicated for the incontinent child who can use the hand controls. Range-of-motion stretches minimize contractures. Orthopedic surgery may be indicated to correct contractures. Botulinum toxin has been shown to reduce or delay the need for surgery. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, or another anticonvulsant may be used to control seizures. Muscle relaxants or neurosurgery may be required to decrease spasticity. Children with milder forms of CP should attend a regular school; severely afflicted children may need special education. Special considerations A child with CP may be hospitalized for orthopedic surgery or for treatment of other complications. Speak slowly and distinctly. Encourage the child to ask for things he wants. Listen patiently and don't rush him. Plan a high-calorie diet that's adequate to meet the child's high- energy needs. During meals, maintain a quiet, unhurried atmosphere with as few distractions as possible. The child should be encouraged to feed himself and may need special utensils and a chair with a solid footrest. Teach him to place food far back in his mouth to facilitate swallowing. Encourage the child to chew food thoroughly, drink through a straw, and suck on lollipops to develop the muscle control needed to minimize drooling. Allow the child to wash and dress independently, assisting only as needed. The child may need clothing modifications. Give all care in an unhurried manner; otherwise, muscle spasticity may increase. Encourage the child and his family to participate in the plan of care so they can continue it at home. Care for associated hearing or visual disturbances, as necessary. Give frequent mouth care and dental care, as necessary. Reduce muscle spasms that increase postoperative pain by moving and turning the child carefully after surgery; provide analgesics as needed. After orthopedic surgery, provide cast care. Reposition the child often, check for foul odor, and ventilate under the cast with a cool air blow- dryer. Use a flashlight to check for\\nskin breakdown beneath the cast. Help the child relax, perhaps by giving a warm bath, before reapplying a bivalved cast. To help the parents: Encourage them to set realistic individual goals. Assist in planning crafts and other activities. Stress the child's need to develop peer relationships; warn the parents against being overprotective. Identify and deal with family stress. The parents may feel unreasonable guilt about their child's handicap and may\\nneed P psychological counseling. Refer the parents to supportive community organizations. For more information, tell them to contact the United Cerebral Palsy Association or their local chapter. Hydrocephalus Hydrocephalus is an excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricular spaces of the brain. In\\ninfants, hydrocephalus enlarges the head; in infants and adults, resulting compression can damage brain tissue. With early detection and surgical intervention, the prognosis improves but remains guarded. Even after surgery, such complications as mental retardation, impaired motor function, and vision loss can persist. Without surgery, the prognosis is poor: Mortality may result from increased intracranial pressure (ICP); infants may also die prematurely of infection and malnutrition. NORMAL CIRCULATION OF CSF Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced from blood in a capillary network (choroid plexus) in the brain's lateral ventricles. From the lateral ventricles, CSF flows through the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro) to the third ventricle. From there, it flows through the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle and through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie to the cisterna of the subarachnoid space. Then, the fluid passes under the base of the brain, upward over the brain's upper surfaces, and down around the spinal cord.\\nEventually, CSF reaches the arachnoid villi, where it's reabsorbed into\\nvenous blood at the venous sinuses. Normally, the amount of fluid produced (about 500 ml/day)\\nequals the amount absorbed. The average amount circulated at one time is 150 to 175 ml. P Causes and incidence Hydrocephalus may result from an obstruction in CSF flow (noncommunicating hydrocephalus) or from faulty absorption of CSF (communicating hydrocephalus). (See Normal circulation of CSF .) In noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the obstruction occurs\\nmost frequently between the third and fourth ventricles, at the aqueduct of Sylvius, but it can also occur at the outlets of the fourth ventricle (foramina of Luschka and Magendie) or, rarely, at the foramen of Monro. This obstruction may result from faulty fetal development, infection (syphilis, granulomatous diseases, meningitis), a tumor, cerebral aneurysm, or a blood clot (after intracranial hemorrhage). In communicating hydrocephalus, faulty absorption of CSF may result from surgery to repair a myelomeningocele, adhesions between meninges at the base of the brain, or meningeal hemorrhage. Rarely, a tumor in the choroid plexus causes overproduction of CSF, producing hydrocephalus. SIGNS OF HYDROCEPHALUS In infants, characteristic changes of hydrocephalus include marked enlargement of the head; distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; and weak muscles that can't support the head. Hydrocephalus occurs most commonly in neonates but can also occur in adults as a result of injury or disease. It affects 1 of every 1,000 people. Complications Mental retardation Impaired motor function Vision loss Death Signs and symptoms In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing head circumference, clearly disproportionate to the infant's growth. Other characteristic changes include widening and bulging of the fontanels; distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; and underdeveloped neck muscles. (See Signs of hydrocephalus .)\\nIn severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbit is depressed, the eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae are prominent. Sclera seen above the iris is called the \\u201csetting-sun sign.\\u201d A high-pitched, shrill cry, abnormal muscle tone of the legs, irritability, anorexia, and projectile vomiting commonly occur. In adults and older children, indicators of hydrocephalus include decreased level of consciousness (LOC), ataxia, incontinence, loss of coordination, and impaired intellect. Diagnosis In infants, abnormally large head size for the patient's age strongly suggests hydrocephalus. Measurement of head circumference is a most important diagnostic technique. Skull X-rays show thinning of the skull with separation of sutures and widening of fontanels. Other diagnostic tests for hydrocephalus, including arteriography, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging,\\ncan differentiate between hydrocephalus and intracranial lesions and can also demonstrate the Arnold-Chiari deformity, which may occur in an infant with hydrocephalus. (See Arnold-Chiari syndrome .) Treatment Surgical correction is the only treatment for hydrocephalus. Surgery typically consists of insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which transports excess fluid from the lateral ventricle into the peritoneal cavity. A less common procedure is\\ninsertion of a ventriculoatrial shunt, which drains fluid from the brain's lateral ventricle into the right atrium of the heart, where the fluid makes its way into the venous circulation. Complications of surgery include shunt infection, septicemia (after ventriculoatrial shunt), adhesions and paralytic ileus, migration, peritonitis, and intestinal perforation (with peritoneal shunt). Special considerations On initial assessment, obtain a complete history from the patient or his family. Note general behavior, especially irritability, apathy, or decreased LOC. Perform a neurologic assessment. Examine the eyes: pupils should be equal and reactive to light. In adults and older P children, evaluate movements and motor strength in extremities. Watch especially for ataxia, confusion, and incontinence. Ask the patient if he has headaches, and watch for projectile vomiting; both are signs of increased ICP. Also watch for seizures. Note changes in vital signs. Before surgery to insert a shunt: Encourage maternal-infant bonding when possible. When caring for the infant yourself, hold him on your lap for feeding; stroke and cuddle him, and speak soothingly. Check fontanels for tension or fullness, and measure and record head circumference. On the patient's chart, draw a\\npicture showing where to measure the head so that other staff members measure it in the same place, or mark the forehead with ink. To prevent postfeeding aspiration and hypostatic pneumonia, place the infant on his side and reposition every 2\\nhours, or prop him up in an infant seat. To prevent skin breakdown, make sure his earlobe is flat, and place a sheepskin or rubber foam under his head. When turning the infant, move his head, neck, and shoulders with his body to reduce strain on his neck. Feed the infant slowly. To lessen strain from the weight of the infant's head on your arm while holding him during feeding, place his head, neck, and shoulders on a pillow. After surgery: Place the infant on the side opposite the operative site with his head level with his body unless the physician's orders specify otherwise. Check temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and LOC. Also check fontanels for fullness daily. Watch for vomiting, which may be an early sign of increased ICP and shunt malfunction. Watch for signs of infection, especially meningitis: fever, stiff neck, irritability, or tense fontanels. Also watch for redness, swelling, or other signs of local infection over the shunt tract. Check dressing often for drainage. Listen for bowel sounds after ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Check the infant's growth and development periodically, and help the parents set goals consistent with ability and\\npotential. Help parents focus on their child's strengths, not his weaknesses. Discuss special education programs, and emphasize the infant's need for sensory stimulation appropriate for his age. Teach parents to watch for signs of shunt malfunction, infection, and paralytic ileus. Tell them that surgery for lengthening the shunt will be required periodically as the child grows older. Surgery may also be required to correct shunt malfunctioning or to treat infection. Emphasize that hydrocephalus is a lifelong problem and that the child will require regular, continuing evaluation. ARNOLD-CHIARI SYNDROME Arnold-Chiari syndrome frequently accompanies hydrocephalus, especially when a myelomeningocele is also present. In this condition, an elongation or tonguelike downward projection of the cerebellum and medulla extends through the foramen magnum into the cervical portion of the spinal canal, impairing cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the fourth ventricle. In addition to signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, infants with Arnold-Chiari syndrome have nuchal rigidity, noisy respirations, irritability, vomiting, weak sucking reflex, and a preference for hyperextension of the neck. Treatment requires surgery to insert a shunt like that used in hydrocephalus. Surgical decompression of the cerebellar tonsils at the foramen magnum is sometimes indicated. Cerebral aneurysm P Cerebral aneurysm is a localized dilation of a cerebral artery that typically results from a congenital weakness in the arterial\\nwall. Its most common form is the berry aneurysm, a saclike outpouching\\nin a cerebral artery. Cerebral aneurysms may arise at an arterial junction in the Circle of Willis, the circular anastomosis forming the major cerebral arteries at the base of the brain. Cerebral aneurysms can rupture and cause subarachnoid hemorrhage. (See Most common sites of cerebral aneurysm .) MOST COMMON SITES OF CEREBRAL ANEURYSM Cerebral aneurysms usually arise at arterial bifurcations in the Circle of Willis and its branches. The illustration below shows the most common aneurysm sites around this circle. The prognosis is guarded. Probably half the patients with\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhages die immediately; of those who survive untreated, 40% die from the effects of hemorrhage; another 20% die later\\nfrom recurring hemorrhage. New treatments are improving the prognosis, however. Causes and incidence Cerebral aneurysm may result from a congenital defect, a degenerative process, or a combination of both. For example, hypertension and atherosclerosis may disrupt blood flow and exert pressure against a congenitally weak arterial wall, stretching it like an overblown balloon and making it likely to rupture. After such rupture, blood spills into the space normally occupied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in P subarachnoid hemorrhage. Blood may also spill into the brain tissue and form a clot, which can result in potentially fatal increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain-tissue damage. Incidence is slightly higher in women than in men, especially those in their late 40s or early to mid-50s, but cerebral aneurysm may occur at any age, in both women and men. Complications (Most common after a rupture) Subarachnoid hemorrhage Brain tissue infarction Rebleeding Meningeal irritation Hydrocephalus Signs and symptoms Occasionally, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes premonitory symptoms that last several days, such as headache, nuchal rigidity, stiff back and legs, and intermittent nausea. Usually, however, onset is abrupt and without warning, causing a sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting and, depending on the severity and location of bleeding, altered consciousness (including deep coma). Bleeding causes meningeal irritation, resulting in nuchal\\nrigidity, back and leg pain, fever, restlessness, irritability, occasional seizures, and blurred vision. Bleeding into the brain tissues\\ncauses hemiparesis, hemisensory defects, dysphagia, and visual defects.\\nIf the aneurysm is near the internal carotid artery, it compresses the oculomotor nerve and causes diplopia, ptosis, dilated pupil, and inability to rotate the eye. The severity of symptoms varies considerably from patient\\nto patient, depending on the site and amount of bleeding. To better describe their conditions, patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms are\\ngrouped as follows: Grade I (minimal bleed): Patient is alert with no neurologic deficit; he may have a slight headache and nuchal rigidity. Grade II (mild bleed): Patient is alert, with a mild to severe headache, nuchal rigidity and, possibly, third-nerve palsy. Grade III (moderate bleed): Patient is confused or drowsy, with nuchal rigidity and, possibly, a mild focal deficit. Grade IV (severe bleed): Patient is stuporous, with nuchal rigidity and, possibly, mild to severe hemiparesis. Grade V (moribund; commonly fatal): If nonfatal, patient is in deep coma or decerebrate. Generally, cerebral aneurysm poses three major threats: Death from increased ICP: Increased ICP may push the brain downward, impair brain stem function, and cut off blood supply to the part of the brain that supports vital functions. Rebleed: Generally, after the initial bleeding episode, a clot forms and seals the rupture, which reinforces the wall of the aneurysm for 7 to 10 days.\\nHowever, after the 7th day, fibrinolysis begins to dissolve the clot and increases the risk of rebleeding. Signs and symptoms are similar to those accompanying the initial hemorrhage. Rebleeds during the first 24 hours after initial hemorrhage aren't uncommon, and they contribute to cerebral aneurysm's high mortality. Vasospasm: Why\\nthis occurs isn't clearly understood. Usually, vasospasm occurs in blood vessels adjacent to the cerebral aneurysm, but it may extend to major vessels of the brain, causing ischemia and altered brain function. Other complications of cerebral aneurysm include pulmonary embolism (a possible adverse effect of deep vein thrombosis or\\naneurysm treatment) and acute hydrocephalus, occurring as CSF accumulates in the cranial cavity because of blockage by blood or adhesions. Diagnosis Diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm is based on the patient history and a neurologic examination; computed tomography scan, which reveals P subarachnoid or ventricular blood; or magnetic resonance imaging, which can identify a cerebral aneurysm as a flow void. Cerebral angiography remains the procedure of choice for diagnosing cerebral aneurysm. Lumbar puncture may be used to identify blood in CSF if other studies are negative and the patient has no signs of increased ICP. Lumbar puncture should be performed if no contraindication is present and you strongly suspect a bleed, as imaging studies may miss a bleed. REPAIR OF CEREBRAL ANEURYSM Clipping a cerebral aneurysm The clip, which is made of materials that won't affect metal detectors and that will not rust, is placed at the base of the aneurysm to stop the blood supply. The clip remains in place permanently. Coil embolization In coil embolization, soft platinum coils are inserted into the aneurysm through the femoral artery. Usually 5 to 6 coils are needed to fill the aneurysm. The goal is to prevent blood flow into the aneurysm sac by filling the aneurysm with coils and thrombus. Other baseline laboratory studies include complete blood count, urinalysis, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, coagulation studies, serum osmolality, and electrolyte and glucose levels. Treatment Coil embolization of the aneurysm aims to reduce the risk\\nof bleeding, rebleeding after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction or by clipping the aneurysm. (See Repair of cerebral aneurysm. )\\nBoth methods have advantages and disadvantages. Reinforcing the aneurysm with wrapping when the vessel is easily accessible is an alternative in specific situations. Surgical repair with clipping is usually performed at 7 to 10 days, whereas coil embolization has been found to be safe in the first 2 days after hemorrhage. Vasospasm, which previously had been the source of morbidity and mortality associated with successful surgical intervention, has shown therapeutic promise with transluminal balloon angioplasty and intra-arterial papaverine (Pava-Tine SR). In addition intra-arterial nimodipine, nicardipine (Cardene), verapamil (Isoptin) and milrinone (Primacor) as well as newer\\ndrugs fasudil hydrochloride and colforsin daropate are under investigation. When surgical correction is delayed or hazardous due to aneurismal location or fitness of the patient, treatment includes: careful control of blood pressure (Calcium channel blockers are preferred.) bed rest and avoidance of head-down position P avoidance of stimulants, including caffeine and catecholamines avoidance of platelet inhibitors such as aspirin corticosteroids (sometimes used to decrease edema but studies are not conclusive) anticonvulsants sedatives a fibrinolytic inhibitor, to minimize the risk of rebleed by delaying blood clot lysis. After surgical repair, the patient's condition depends on\\nthe extent of damage from the initial bleed and the success of treatment for any resulting complications. Surgery can't improve the patient's neurologic condition unless it removes a hematoma or reduces the compression effect. Special considerations An accurate neurologic assessment, good patient care, patient and family teaching, and psychological support can\\nspeed recovery and reduce complications. During initial treatment after hemorrhage,\\nestablish and maintain a patent airway if the patient needs supplementary oxygen. Position the patient to promote pulmonary drainage\\nand prevent upper airway obstruction. If he's intubated, administering 100% oxygen before suctioning to remove secretions will prevent hypoxia and vasodilation from carbon dioxide accumulation. Suction no longer than 20 seconds to avoid increased ICP. Give frequent nose and mouth care. Impose aneurysm precautions to minimize the risk of rebleed and to avoid increased ICP. Such precautions include\\nbed rest in a quiet, darkened room (keep the head of the bed flat or under 30 degrees, as ordered); limited visitors; avoiding strenuous physical activity and straining with bowel movements; and restricted fluid intake. Be sure to explain why these restrictive measures are necessary. Preventive measures and good patient care can minimize other complications: Turn the patient often. Encourage occasional deep breathing and leg movement. Warn the patient to avoid all unnecessary physical activity. Assist with active range-of-motion exercises; if the patient is paralyzed, perform regular passive range-of-motion exercises. Monitor ABG levels, LOC, and vital signs often, and accurately measure intake and output. Avoid taking temperature rectally because vagus nerve stimulation may cause cardiac arrest. Watch for these danger signals, which may indicate an enlarging aneurysm, rebleeding, intracranial clot, vasospasm, or other complication: decreased LOC, unilateral enlarged pupil, onset or worsening of hemiparesis or motor deficit, increased blood pressure, slowed pulse, worsening of headache or sudden onset of a\\nheadache, renewed or worsened nuchal rigidity, and renewed or persistent vomiting. Intermittent signs such as restlessness, extremity weakness, and speech alterations can also indicate increasing ICP. Give fluids as ordered, and monitor I.V. infusions to avoid increased ICP. If the patient has facial weakness, assess\\nthe gag reflex and assist him during meals, placing food in the unaffected side of his mouth. If he can't swallow, insert a nasogastric tube as ordered, and give all tube feedings slowly. Prevent skin breakdown by taping the tube so it doesn't press against the nostril. If\\nthe patient can eat, provide a high- fiber diet to prevent straining at stool, which can increase ICP. Obtain an order for a stool softener, such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, or a mild laxative, and administer as ordered. Don't force fluids. Implement a bowel program based on previous habits. If the patient is receiving steroids, check the stool for blood. With third or facial nerve palsy, administer artificial tears or ointment to the affected eye, and tape the eye shut at night to prevent corneal damage. To minimize stress, encourage relaxation techniques. If possible, avoid using restraints because these can cause agitation and raise ICP. P Administer antihypertensives as indicated. Carefully monitor blood pressure and immediately report any significant change, but especially a rise in systolic pressure. Prevent deep vein thrombosis by applying antiembolism stockings or sequential compression sleeves. If the patient can't speak, establish a simple means of communication, or use cards or a notepad. Try to limit conversation to topics that won't frustrate the patient. Encourage his family to speak to him in a normal tone, even if he doesn't seem to respond. Provide emotional support, and include the\\npatient's family in his care as much as possible. Encourage family members to adopt a realistic attitude, but don't discourage hope. Before discharge, make a referral to a visiting nurse or a rehabilitation center when necessary, and teach the patient and his family how to recognize signs of rebleeding. Arteriovenous malformations Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a disorder of the blood vessels consisting of an abnormal connection between the arteries and the veins in the brain. It's a congenital disorder commonly\\nresulting in tangled masses of thin-walled, dilated blood vessels between arteries and veins that aren't connected by capillaries. AVM primarily occurs in the posterior portion of the cerebral hemispheres. Adequate perfusion of brain tissue is prevented due to abnormal channels\\nbetween the arterial and venous systems that allow mixing of oxygenated\\nand unoxygenated blood. AVMs range in size from a few millimeters to large malformations that extend from the cerebral cortex to the ventricles. Patients typically present with multiple AVMs. Complications of AVM include development of aneurysm and subsequent rupture, hemorrhage (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural, depending on the location of the AVM), and hydrocephalus. Causes and incidence Although some AVMs occur as a result of penetrating injuries such as trauma, most are present at birth. However, symptoms typically don't occur until between the ages 10 and 20. Very large AVMs may short- circuit blood flow enough to cause cardiac decompensation, in which the heart can't pump enough blood to compensate for arteriovenous shunting in the brain. This typically occurs in infants and young children. The vessels of an AVM are very thin and one or more arteries feed into it, causing it to appear dilated and tortuous. Typically, high-pressured arterial flow moves into the venous system through the connecting channels to increase venous pressure, engorging and dilating the venous structures. If the AVM is large enough, the shunting can deprive the surrounding tissue of adequate blood flow. Thin-walled vessels may ooze small amounts of blood\\u2014they may even rupture\\u2014causing hemorrhage into the brain or subarachnoid space. Cerebral arteriovenous malformations occur in approximately 3 out of 10,000 people. Although the lesion is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any time. Two-thirds of cases occur before age 40. Evidence suggests that AVMs run in families. Males and females are affected equally. Complications Aneurysm and subsequent rupture Intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage Hydrocephalus Signs and symptoms An AVM may be asymptomatic until complications occur; these may include rupture and a resulting sudden bleed in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Arteriovenous malformations vary in size and location within the brain. Systolic bruit may be auscultated over the carotid artery, mastoid process, or orbit on examination. Symptoms that occur prior to an AVM rupture are related to smaller and slower bleeding from the abnormal vessels, which are usually fragile because their structure is abnormal. P In more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage from the malformation is the first symptom. Depending on the location and the severity of the bleed, the hemorrhage can be profoundly disabling or fatal. The risk of bleeding from an AVM is approximately 2% to 4% per year. The first symptoms often include headache, seizure, or other sudden neurological problems, such as vision problems, weakness, inability to move a limb or a side of the body, lack of sensation in part of the body, or abnormal sensations, such as ringing and numbness. Symptoms are the same as for stroke. The individual with an AVM may complain of chronic mild headache, a sudden and severe headache, or a localized or general headache. The headache may resemble migraine and vomiting may occur. Seizures may result from focal neurologic deficits (depending on the location of the AVM) resulting from compression and diminished perfusion. Symptoms of intracranial (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural) hemorrhage result. Muscle weakness and decreased sensation can occur in any part of the body. Mental status change can occur where the individual appears sleepy, stuporous, lethargic, confused, disoriented, or irritable. Additional symptoms may include stiff neck, speech or sense of smell impairment, dysfunctional movement, fainting, facial paralysis, eyelid drooping, tinnitus, dizziness, and decreased level of consciousness (LOC). If an AVM bleeds once, the risk is greater that it will bleed again in the future. Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages are\\nthe most common first symptoms of cerebral arteriovenous malformation. In some cases, symptoms may also occur due to lack of blood flow to an area of the brain (ischemia), compression or distortion of brain tissue by large AVMs, or abnormal brain development in the area of the malformation. Progressive loss of nerve cells in the brain may occur, caused by mechanical (pressure) and ischemic (lack of blood supply) factors. Diagnosis Tests used to diagnose AVM include head computed tomography scan, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography. An EEG may be performed if symptoms include seizures, but this test isn't diagnostic of the specific area of the lesion. Cerebral arteriogram confirms the presence of AVMs and evaluates blood flow. Doppler ultrasonography of cerebrovascular system indicates abnormal, turbulent blood flow. Treatment General support measures include aneurysm precautions to prevent possible rupture. This involves placing the patient on bed rest or with limited activity and maintaining a quiet atmosphere. Analgesics may be given for headache, and sedatives may be given to help calm the patient and prevent rupture. Stool softeners may be given to prevent straining at stool, which increases intracranial pressure. A bleeding AVM is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization. The goal of treatment is to prevent further complications by limiting bleeding, controlling seizures and, if possible, removing the AVM. Surgery for correction may include block dissection, laser, or ligation to repair the communicating channels and remove the feeding vessels. Embolization or radiation therapy may be done, if surgery isn't possible, to close the communicating channels and\\nfeeder vessels, thereby reducing blood flow to the AVM. Open brain surgery, endovascular treatment, and radiosurgery may be used separately\\nor in any combination, depending upon the physician and the patient's individual situation. Surgery is dependent upon the accessibility and size of the lesion and the patient's status. Open brain surgery involves\\nthe actual removal of the malformation in the brain through an opening made in the skull. This surgery is particularly risky because the surgery itself may cause the AVM to bleed uncontrollably. Embolization (injecting a gluelike substance into the abnormal vessels to stop aberrant blood flow into the AVM) may be an alternative if surgery isn't feasible due to the size or location of the\\nlesion. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also be an alternative for patients with inoperable arteriovenous malformations. It's particularly useful for small, deep lesions, which are difficult to remove by surgery. Anticonvulsant medications such as phenytoin are usually prescribed if seizures occur. Special considerations P Monitor vital signs and adjust medications to control hypertension. Monitor neurologic status. Monitor for seizure activity and institute seizure precautions. Maintain a quiet atmosphere and provide relaxation techniques. Discuss the importance of reporting any signs of intracranial bleeding immediately (sudden severe headache, vision changes, decreased movement in extremities, and change in LOC). Refer to social service for support services if neurological deficits have occurred from a ruptured AVM. PAROXYSMAL DISORDERS Headache The most common patient complaint, headache usually occurs as a symptom of an underlying disorder. Ninety percent of all headaches are vascular, muscle contraction, or a combination; 10% are due to underlying intracranial, systemic, or psychological disorders. Migraine headaches, probably the most intensively studied, are throbbing, vascular headaches that usually begin to appear in childhood or adolescence and recur throughout adulthood. Causes and incidence Most chronic headaches result from tension (muscle contraction), which may be caused by emotional stress, fatigue, menstruation, or environmental stimuli (noise, crowds, or bright lights). Other possible causes include glaucoma; inflammation of the eyes or mucosa of the nasal or paranasal sinuses; diseases of the scalp,\\nteeth, extracranial arteries, or external or middle ear; muscle spasms of the face, neck, or shoulders; and cervical arthritis. In addition, headaches may be caused by vasodilators (nitrates, alcohol, and histamine), systemic disease, hypoxia, hypertension, head trauma and tumor, intracranial bleeding, abscess, or aneurysm. The cause of migraine headache is unknown, but it's associated with constriction and dilation of intracranial and extracranial arteries. Certain biochemical abnormalities are thought to occur during a migraine attack. These include local leakage of a vasodilator polypeptide called neurokinin through the dilated arteries and a decrease in the plasma level of serotonin. Headache pain may emanate from the pain-sensitive structures of the skin, scalp, muscles, arteries, and veins; cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X; or cervical nerves 1, 2, and 3. Intracranial mechanisms of headaches include traction or displacement of arteries, venous sinuses, or venous tributaries and inflammation or direct pressure on the cranial nerves with afferent pain fibers. Affecting up to 10% of Americans, headaches are more common in females and have a strong familial incidence. Drops in estrogen level may precipitate migraine headaches. Complications Worsening of preexisting hypertension Photophobia Emotional lability Motor weakness Signs and symptoms Initially, migraine headaches usually produce unilateral,\\npulsating pain, which later becomes more generalized. They're commonly preceded by a scintillating scotoma, hemianopsia, unilateral paresthesia, or speech disorders. The patient may experience irritability, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. (See Clinical features of migraine headaches .) Both muscle contraction and tractioninflammatory vascular\\nheadaches produce a dull, persistent ache, tender spots on the head and\\nneck, and a feeling of tightness around the head, with a characteristic\\n\\u201chatband\\u201d distribution. The pain is usually severe and unrelenting. If caused by intracranial bleeding, these headaches may result in neurologic deficits, P such as paresthesia and muscle weakness; narcotics may fail to relieve pain in these cases. If caused by a tumor, pain is most severe when the patient awakens. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires a history of recurrent headaches and physical examination of the head and neck. Such examination includes percussion, auscultation for bruits, inspection for signs of infection, and palpation for defects, crepitus, or tender spots (especially after trauma). Firm diagnosis also requires a complete neurologic examination,\\nassessment for other systemic diseases\\u2014such as hypertension\\u2014and a psychosocial evaluation, when such factors are suspected. CLINICAL FEATURES OF MIGRAINE HEADACHES Type Signs and symptoms Common migraine (most prevalent) Usually occurs on weekends and holidays \\u25aa Prodromal symptoms (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fluid imbalance) precede headache by about 1 day. \\u25aa Sensitivity to light and noise (most prominent feature) \\u25aa Headache pain (unilateral or bilateral, aching or throbbing) Classic migraine Usually occurs in compulsive personalities and within families \\u25aa\\nProdromal symptoms include visual disturbances, such as zigzag lines and bright lights (most common), sensory disturbances (tingling of face,\\nlips, and hands), or motor disturbances (staggering gait). \\u25aa Recurrent and periodic headaches Hemiplegic and ophthalmoplegic migraine (rare) Usually occurs in young adults \\u25aa Severe, unilateral pain \\u25aa Extraocular muscle palsies (involving third cranial nerve) and ptosis P \\u25aa With repeated headaches, possible permanent third cranial nerve injury \\u25aa In hemiplegic migraine, neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, hemiplegia) may persist after the headache subsides. Basilar artery migraine Occurs in young women before their menstrual periods \\u25aa\\nProdromal symptoms usually include partial vision loss followed by vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, tinnitus and, sometimes, tingling of the fingers and toes, lasting from several minutes to almost an hour. \\u25aa Headache pain, severe occipital throbbing, vomiting Cluster headaches Occur in men more commonly than women and occur at all ages, but more commonly in adolescents and middle-age people. \\u25aa\\nEpisodic type (more common) and involves one to three short-lived attacks of periorbital pain per day over a 4- to 8-week period followed by a pain-free interval averaging 1 year. Chronic type occurs after an episodic pattern is established. \\u25aa Unilateral pain occurs without warning, reaching a crescendo within\\n5 minutes, and described as excruciating and deep, with attacks lasting\\nfrom 30 minutes to 2 hours. \\u25aa Associated symptoms may include tearing, reddening of the eye, nasal stuffiness, lid ptosis, and nausea. Diagnostic tests include cervical spine and sinus X-rays,\\nEEG, computed tomography scan\\u2014performed before lumbar puncture to rule out increased intracranial pressure (ICP)\\u2014or magnetic resonance imaging.\\nA lumbar puncture isn't done if there's evidence of increased ICP or if\\na brain tumor is suspected because rapidly reducing pressure by removing spinal fluid can cause brain herniation. Treatment Depending on the type of headache, analgesics \\u2014ranging from aspirin to codeine or meperidine\\u2014may provide symptomatic relief. Other measures include identification and elimination of causative factors and, possibly, psychotherapy for headaches caused by emotional stress. Chronic tension headaches may also respond to muscle relaxants. For migraine headaches, ergotamine alone or with caffeine\\nmay be an effective treatment. The Food and Drug Administration allows labeling of various analgesic preparations that include caffeine to state that they're for the treatment of migraine headaches. Remember that these medications can't be taken by pregnant women because they stimulate uterine contractions. These drugs and others, such as metoclopramide or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, work best when taken early in the course of an attack. If nausea and vomiting make oral\\nadministration impossible, drugs may be given as rectal suppositories. Drugs in the class of sumatriptan are considered by many clinicians to be the drug of choice for acute migraine attacks or cluster headaches. Drugs that can help prevent migraine headaches include antidepressants (such as nortriptyline or fluoxetine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcium-channel blockers (verapamil). Corticosteroids provide short- term relief for some patients with cluster\\nheadaches. Special considerations Headaches seldom require hospitalization unless caused by a serious disorder. If that's the case, direct your care to the underlying problem. Obtain a complete patient history: duration and location of the headache; time of day it usually begins; nature of the pain; concurrence with other symptoms such as blurred vision; precipitating factors, such as tension, menstruation, loud noises, menopause, or alcohol; medications taken such as oral contraceptives; or prolonged fasting. Exacerbating factors can also be assessed through ongoing observation of the patient's personality, habits, activities of daily living, family relationships, coping mechanisms, and relaxation activities. Using the history as a guide, help the patient avoid exacerbating factors. Advise him to lie down in a dark, quiet room during an attack and to place ice packs on his forehead or a cold cloth over his eyes. Instruct the patient to take the prescribed medication at the onset of migraine symptoms, to prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids after nausea and vomiting subside, and to use other headache relief measures. The patient with a migraine headache usually needs to be hospitalized only if nausea and vomiting are severe enough to induce dehydration and possible shock. Avoid repeated use of narcotics if possible. PREVENTION Advise patient to: get adequate sleep eat a well-balanced diet and drink plenty of water do upper-body stretching exercises. quit smoking learn relaxation techniques such as yoga, medication, and deep breathing avoid known causative triggers. Seizure disorder Seizure disorder, also called epilepsy, is a condition of\\nthe brain marked by a susceptibility to recurrent seizures\\u2014paroxysmal events associated with abnormal electrical discharges of neurons in the brain. Causes and incidence In about half the cases of seizure disorder, the cause is unknown. However, some possible causes of seizure disorder include: birth trauma (inadequate oxygen supply to the brain, blood incompatibility, or hemorrhage) perinatal infection anoxia (after respiratory or cardiac arrest) infectious diseases (meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess) P ingestion of toxins (mercury, lead, or carbon monoxide) tumors of the brain inherited disorders or degenerative disease, such as phenylketonuria or tuberous sclerosis head injury or trauma metabolic disorders, such as hypoglycemia or hypoparathyroidism stroke (hemorrhage, thrombosis, or embolism). Alcohol withdrawal can cause nonepileptic seizures. Seizure disorder affects 1% to 2% of the population. However, 80% of patients have good seizure control if they strictly adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen. Complications Anoxia (during a seizure) Fall injuries Signs and symptoms The hallmarks of seizure disorder are recurring seizures,\\nwhich can be classified as partial or generalized (some patients may be\\naffected by more than one type). Partial seizures arise from a localized area of the brain, causing specific symptoms. In some patients, partial seizure activity may spread to the entire brain, causing a generalized seizure. Partial seizures include simple partial (jacksonian) and complex partial\\nseizures (psychomotor or temporal lobe). A simple partial motor-type seizure begins as a localized\\nmotor seizure characterized by a spread of abnormal activity to adjacent areas of the brain. It typically produces stiffening or jerking\\nin one extremity, accompanied by a tingling sensation in the same area.\\nFor example, it may start in the thumb and spread to the entire hand and arm. The patient seldom loses consciousness, although the seizure may progress to a generalized seizure. A simple partial sensory-type seizure involves perceptual distortion, which can include hallucinations. The symptoms of a complex partial seizure vary but usually include purposeless behavior. The patient experiences an aura immediately before the seizure. An aura represents the beginning of abnormal electrical discharges within a focal area of the brain and may include a pungent smell, GI distress (nausea or indigestion), a rising or sinking feeling in the stomach, a dreamy feeling, an unusual taste, or a visual disturbance. Overt signs of a complex partial seizure include a glassy stare, picking at one's clothes, aimless wandering, lipsmacking or chewing motions, and unintelligible speech; these signs may last for just a few seconds or as long as 20 minutes. Mental confusion may last several minutes after the seizure; as a result, an observer may mistakenly suspect intoxication with alcohol or drugs or psychosis. Generalized seizures, as the term suggests, cause a generalized electrical abnormality within the brain and include several distinct types: Absence (petit mal) seizures occur most commonly in children, although they may affect adults as well. They usually begin with a brief change in level of consciousness, indicated by blinking or rolling of the eyes, a blank stare, and slight mouth movements. There's little or no tonic-clonic movement. The patient retains his posture and continues preseizure activity without difficulty. Typically, each seizure lasts from 1 to 10 seconds. If not properly treated, seizures can recur as often as 100 times per day. An absence seizure may progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A myoclonic (bilateral massive epileptic myoclonus) seizure is characterized by brief, involuntary muscular jerks of the body or extremities, which may occur in a rhythmic fashion and may precede generalized tonic-clonic seizures by months or years. A generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure typically begins with a loud cry, precipitated by air rushing from the lungs through the vocal cords. The patient then falls to the ground, losing consciousness. The body stiffens (tonic phase) and then alternates between episodes of P muscular spasm and relaxation (clonic phase). Tongue-biting, incontinence, labored breathing, apnea, and subsequent cyanosis may also occur. The seizure stops in 2 to 5 minutes,\\nwhen abnormal electrical conduction of the neurons is completed. The patient then regains consciousness but is somewhat confused and may have difficulty talking. If he can talk, he\\nmay complain of drowsiness, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, and arm\\nor leg weakness. He may fall into deep sleep after the seizure. These seizures may start as facial seizures and spread to become generalized. An akinetic seizure is characterized by a general loss of\\npostural tone (the patient falls in a flaccid state) and a temporary loss of consciousness. It occurs in young children and is sometimes called a \\u201cdrop attack\\u201d because it causes the child to fall. Status epilepticus is a continuous seizure state that can\\noccur in all seizure types. The most life-threatening example is generalized tonic- clonic status epilepticus, a continuous generalized tonic-clonic seizure without intervening return of consciousness. Status\\nepilepticus is accompanied by respiratory distress. It can result from abrupt withdrawal of anticonvulsant medications, hypoxic encephalopathy, acute head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, or septicemia secondary to\\nencephalitis or meningitis. Diagnosis Clinically, the diagnosis of seizure disorder is based on\\nthe occurrence of one or more seizures and proof or the assumption that\\nthe condition that led to them is still present. Diagnostic information is obtained from the patient's history and description of seizure activity and from family history, physical and neurologic examinations, and computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. These scans offer density readings of the brain and may indicate abnormalities in internal structures. Paroxysmal abnormalities on the EEG confirm the diagnosis by providing evidence of the continuing tendency to have seizures. A negative EEG doesn't rule out seizure disorder because the paroxysmal abnormalities occur intermittently. Other tests may include serum glucose and calcium studies, skull X-rays, lumbar puncture, brain scan, and cerebral angiography. Treatment Generally, treatment of seizure disorder consists of anticonvulsant therapy to reduce the number of future seizures. The most\\ncommonly prescribed drugs include phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, gabapentin, or primidone administered individually for generalized tonic-clonic seizures and complex partial seizures. Valproic\\nacid, clonazepam, and ethosuximide are commonly prescribed for absence seizures. Gabapentin and felbamate are also anticonvulsant drugs. A patient taking anticonvulsant medications requires monitoring for toxic signs: nystagmus, ataxia, lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech, irritability, nausea, and vomiting. If drug therapy fails, treatment may include surgical removal of a demonstrated focal lesion to attempt to stop seizures. Emergency treatment of status epilepticus usually consists of diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan), phenytoin or phenobarbital (Solfoton); dextrose 50% I.V. (when seizures are secondary to hypoglycemia); and thiamine I.V. (in chronic alcoholism or withdrawal). Special considerations A key to support is a true understanding of the nature of seizure disorder and of the misconceptions that surround it. Encourage the patient and his family to express their feelings about the patient's condition. Answer their questions, and help them cope by dispelling some of the myths about seizure disorder, for example, the myth that seizure disorder is contagious. Assure them that seizure disorder is controllable for most patients who follow a prescribed regimen of medication and that most patients maintain a normal lifestyle. Because drug therapy is the treatment of choice for most people with seizure disorder, information about medications is invaluable. P Stress the need for compliance with the prescribed drug schedule. Reinforce dosage instructions and stress the importance of taking medication regularly, at scheduled times. Caution the patient to monitor the quantity of medication he has so he doesn't run out of it. Warn against possible adverse effects\\u2014drowsiness, lethargy, hyperactivity, confusion, and visual and sleep disturbances\\u2014all of which indicate the need for dosage adjustment.\\nPhenytoin therapy may lead to hyperplasia of the gums, which may be relieved by conscientious oral hygiene. Instruct the patient to report adverse effects immediately. When administering phenytoin I.V., use a large vein and monitor vital signs frequently or administer fosphenytoin\\n(Cerebyx), which has fewer vascular side effects. Avoid I.M. administration and mixing with dextrose solutions. Emphasize the importance of having anticonvulsant blood levels checked at regular intervals, even if the seizures are under control. Warn the patient against drinking alcoholic beverages. Know which social agencies in your community can help epileptic patients. Refer the patient to the Epilepsy\\nFoundation of America for general information and to the state motor vehicle department for information about a driver's license. The primary goals of the health care professional and family members caring for a patient having a seizure are protection from\\ninjury, protection from aspiration, and observation of the seizure activity. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures may necessitate first aid. Show the patient's family members how to administer first aid correctly: Avoid restraining the patient during a seizure. Help the patient to a lying position, loosen any tight clothing, and place something flat and soft, such as a pillow, jacket, or hand, under his head. Clear the area of hard objects. Don't force anything into the patient's mouth if his teeth are clenched\\u2014a tongue blade or spoon could lacerate a mouth and lips or displace teeth,\\nprecipitating respiratory distress. However, if the patient's mouth is open, protect his tongue by placing a soft object (such as a folded cloth) between his teeth. Turn his head to provide an open airway. After\\nthe seizure subsides, reassure the patient that he's all right, orient him to time and place, and inform him that he's had a seizure. Don't restrain\\nthe patient during a complex partial seizure. Clear the area of any hard objects. Protect him from injury by gently calling his name and directing him away from the source of danger. After the seizure passes, reassure him and tell him that he has just had a seizure. BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD DISORDERS Stroke A stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident or brain attack, is a sudden impairment of cerebral circulation in one or more of the blood vessels supplying the brain. A stroke interrupts or diminishes oxygen supply and commonly causes serious damage or necrosis in brain tissues. The sooner circulation returns to normal after a stroke, the better chances are for complete recovery. However, about half of those who survive a stroke remain permanently disabled and experience a recurrence within weeks, months, or years. Causes and incidence A stroke results from obstruction of a blood vessel, typically in extracerebral vessels, but occasionally in intracerebral vessels. Factors that increase the risk of stroke include history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), atherosclerosis, hypertension, kidney\\ndisease, arrhythmias (specifically atrial fibrillation), electrocardiogram changes, rheumatic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, postural hypotension, cardiac or myocardial enlargement, high serum triglyceride levels, lack of exercise, use of oral contraceptives, cigarette smoking, and family history of stroke. (See Transient ischemic attack , page 192.) The major causes of stroke are thrombosis, embolism, and hemorrhage. Thrombosis is the most common cause in middle-age and elderly people, who have a higher incidence of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension. Thrombosis causes ischemia in brain tissue supplied by the affected vessel as well as congestion and edema; the P latter may produce more clinical effects than thrombosis itself, but these symptoms subside with the edema. Thrombosis may develop while the patient sleeps or shortly after he awakens; it can also occur during surgery or after a myocardial infarction. The risk increases with obesity, smoking, or the use of oral contraceptives. Cocaineinduced ischemic stroke is now being seen in younger patients. TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a recurrent episode of neurologic deficit, lasting from seconds to hours, that clears within\\n12 to 24 hours. It's usually considered a warning sign of an impending thrombotic stroke. In fact, TIAs have been reported in 50% to 80% of patients who have had a cerebral infarction from such thrombosis. The age of onset varies. Incidence rises dramatically after age 50 and is highest among blacks and men. Causes In TIA, microemboli released from a thrombus probably temporarily interrupt blood flow, especially in the small distal branches of the arterial tree in the brain. Small spasms in those arterioles may impair blood flow and also precede TIA. Predisposing factors are the same as for thrombotic strokes. The most distinctive characteristics of TIAs are the transient duration of neurologic deficits and complete return of normal function. The symptoms of TIA easily correlate with the location of the affected artery. These symptoms include double vision, speech deficits (slurring or thickness), unilateral blindness, staggering or uncoordinated gait, unilateral weakness or numbness, falling because of weakness in the legs, and dizziness. Treatment During an active TIA, treatment aims to prevent a completed stroke and consists of aspirin or P anticoagulants to minimize the risk of thrombosis. After or between attacks, preventive treatment includes carotid endartectomy or cerebral microvascular bypass. Embolism, the second most common cause of stroke, is an occlusion of a blood vessel caused by a fragmented clot, a tumor, fat, bacteria, or air. It can occur at any age, especially among patients with a history of rheumatic heart disease, endocarditis, posttraumatic valvular disease, myocardial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias,\\nor after open- heart surgery. It usually develops rapidly\\u2014in 10 to 20 seconds\\u2014and without warning. When an embolus reaches the cerebral vasculature, it cuts off circulation by lodging in a narrow portion of an artery, most commonly the middle cerebral artery, causing necrosis and edema. If the embolus is septic and infection extends beyond the vessel wall, encephalitis or an abscess may develop. Hemorrhage, the third most common cause of stroke, may, like embolism, occur suddenly, at any age, and affects more women than men. Hemorrhage results from chronic hypertension or aneurysms, which cause sudden rupture of a cerebral artery, thereby diminishing blood supply to the area served by the artery. In addition, blood accumulates deep within the brain, further compressing neural tissue and causing even greater damage. Strokes are classified according to their course of progression. The least severe is the TIA, or \\u201clittle stroke,\\u201d which results from a temporary interruption of blood flow, most commonly in the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries. A progressive stroke, or stroke-in-evolution (thrombusin-evolution), begins with slight neurologic deficit and worsens in a day or two. In a completed stroke, neurologic deficits are maximal at onset. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in most developed countries today and the most common cause of neurologic disability. It occurs in 1 out of 15 deaths in the United States each year. Complications Unstable blood pressure Fluid imbalances Infection Sensory impairment Altered level of consciousness Aspiration Pulmonary emboli Signs and symptoms Clinical features of stroke vary with the artery affected\\n(and, consequently, the portion of the brain it supplies), the severity\\nof damage, and the extent of collateral circulation that develops to help the brain compensate for decreased blood supply. If the stroke occurs in the left hemisphere, it produces symptoms on the right side; if in the right hemisphere, symptoms are on the left side. However, a stroke that causes cranial nerve damage produces signs of cranial nerve dysfunction on the same side as the hemorrhage. Symptoms are usually classified according to the artery affected: Middle cerebral artery: aphasia, dysphasia, visual field cuts, and hemiparesis on affected side (more severe in the face and arm than in the leg) Carotid artery: weakness, paralysis, numbness, sensory changes, and visual disturbances\\non affected side; altered level of consciousness (LOC), bruits, headaches, aphasia, and ptosis Vertebrobasilar artery: weakness on affected side, numbness around lips and mouth, visual field\\ncuts, diplopia, poor coordination, dysphagia, slurred speech, dizziness, amnesia, and ataxia Anterior cerebral artery: confusion, weakness, and numbness (especially in the leg) on affected side, incontinence, loss of coordination, impaired motor and sensory functions, and personality changes Posterior cerebral arteries: visual field cuts, sensory impairment, dyslexia, coma, and cortical blindness; typically, paralysis is absent. Symptoms can also be classified as premonitory, generalized, and focal. Premonitory symptoms, such as drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and mental confusion, are rare. Generalized symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, mental impairment, seizures, coma,\\nnuchal rigidity, fever, and disorientation, are typical. Focal symptoms, such as sensory and reflex changes, reflect the site of hemorrhage or infarct and may worsen. Diagnosis Diagnosis of stroke is based on observation of clinical features, a history of risk factors, and the results of diagnostic tests: Computed tomography scan shows evidence of\\nhemorrhagic stroke immediately but may not show evidence of thrombotic infarction for 48 to 72 hours. Magnetic resonance imaging may help identify ischemic or infarcted areas and cerebral swelling. Electrocardiogram can help diagnose underlying heart disorders. Carotid duplex may detect carotid artery stenosis. Angiography outlines blood vessels and pinpoints occlusion or rupture site. It's mainly used if surgery is considered. EEG helps to localize damaged area. Other baseline laboratory studies may be done to exclude immune conditions or abnormal clotting that can lead to clot formation. Treatment Surgery performed to improve cerebral circulation for patients with thrombotic or embolic stroke includes endarterectomy (removal of atherosclerotic plaques from the inner arterial wall) and microvascular bypass (surgical anastomosis of an extracranial vessel to an intracranial vessel). Medications useful in stroke include: Tissue plasminogen activator has been used\\nsuccessfully in clot dissolution when administered within 3 hours of the onset of P symptoms. In other circumstances, heparin and warfarin (Coumadin) may be used, as well as aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs. Ticlopidine, an antiplatelet drug, may be more effective than aspirin in preventing stroke and reducing the risk of recurrent stroke after therapy has begun. Anticonvulsants may be used to treat or prevent seizures. Stool softeners may be used to prevent straining, which increases intracranial pressure (ICP). Corticosteroids may be indicated to minimize associated cerebral edema. Analgesics may be used to relieve the headache that typically follows hemorrhagic stroke. Special considerations During the acute phase, efforts focus on survival needs and prevention of further complications. Effective care emphasizes continuing neurologic assessment, support of respiration, continuous monitoring of vital signs, careful positioning to prevent aspiration and\\ncontractures, management of GI problems, and careful monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional status. Patient care must also include measures to prevent complications such as infection. Maintain a patent airway and oxygenation. Loosen constricting clothes. Watch for ballooning of the cheek with respiration. The side that balloons is the side affected by the stroke. If the patient is unconscious, he could aspirate saliva, so keep him in a\\nlateral position to allow secretions to drain naturally or suction secretions, as needed. Insert an artificial airway, and start mechanical\\nventilation or supplemental oxygen, if necessary. Check vital signs and neurologic status, record observations, and report any significant changes to the physician. Monitor blood pressure, LOC, pupillary changes, motor function (voluntary and involuntary movements), sensory function, speech, skin color, temperature, signs of increased ICP, and nuchal rigidity or flaccidity. Remember, if stroke is impending, blood pressure\\nrises suddenly, pulse is rapid and bounding, and the patient may complain of a headache. Also, watch for signs of pulmonary emboli, such as chest pains, shortness of breath, dusky color, tachycardia, fever, and changed sensorium. If the patient is unresponsive, monitor his blood\\ngases often and alert the physician to increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide or decreased partial pressure of oxygen. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. If\\nthe patient can take liquids orally, offer them as often as fluid limitations permit. Administer I.V. fluids as ordered; never give too much too fast because this can increase ICP. Offer the urinal or bedpan every 2 hours. If the patient is incontinent, he may need an indwelling urinary catheter, but this should be avoided, if possible, because of the risk of infection. Ensure adequate nutrition. Check for gag reflex before offering small oral feedings of semisolid foods. Place the\\nfood tray within the patient's visual field because loss of peripheral vision is common. If oral feedings aren't possible, insert a nasogastric\\ntube. Manage GI problems. Be alert for signs that the patient is straining at elimination because this increases ICP.\\nModify diet, administer stool softeners, as indicated, and give laxatives, if necessary. If the patient vomits (usually during the first\\nfew days), keep him positioned on his side to prevent aspiration. Provide careful mouth care. Clean and irrigate the patient's mouth to remove food particles. Care for his dentures as needed. Provide meticulous eye care. Remove secretions with a cotton ball and sterile normal saline solution. Instill eyedrops as ordered. Patch the patient's affected eye if he can't close the lid. Position the patient and align his extremities correctly. Use high- topped sneakers to prevent footdrop and contracture and convoluted foam, flotation, or pulsating mattresses, or sheepskin, to prevent pressure ulcers. To prevent pneumonia, turn the patient at least every 2 hours. Elevate the affected hand to control dependent edema, and place it in a functional position. Assist the patient with exercise. Perform range-of-motion exercises for both the affected and unaffected sides. Teach and encourage the P patient to use his unaffected side to exercise his affected side. Give medications as ordered, and watch for and report adverse effects. Establish and maintain communication with the patient. If he is aphasic, set up a simple method of communicating basic needs. Then, remember to phrase your questions so he'll be able to\\nanswer using this system. Repeat yourself quietly and calmly, and use gestures if necessary to help him understand. Even an unresponsive patient may be able to hear, so don't say anything in his presence you wouldn't want him to hear and remember. Provide psychological support. Set realistic short-term goals. Involve the patient's family in his care when possible, and explain his deficits and strengths. If the patient has a visual field deficit,\\nmake sure caregivers and family members approach the patient from his visually intact side. PREVENTION PREVENTING STROKE Lifestyle modifications can help prevent heart attack and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends the following: Healthy diet Give patients the following advice: Eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Eat six or more servings a day of grain products including whole grains. Eat fish at least twice a week, especially mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon. Include fat-free and low-fat milk products, beans, lean meats, and skinless poultry. Choose fats and oils with 2 grams or less of saturated fat per serving (1 tablespoon). Limit your intake of foods high in calories or low in protein, such as carbonated beverages, high-sugar foods, and candy. Eat less than 6 grams of salt per day (1 teaspoon) Limit foods high in saturated fat, trans fat, or cholesterol, such as whole milk, fatty meats, tropical oils, and\\npartially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Exercise Regular physical activity is defined by the American Heart Association as moderate to vigorous exercise 30 minutes a day on most or all days of the week. A lack of physical activity can lead to obesity and increase the risk of hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. Smoking cessation Even smoking filtered and light or ultralight cigarettes can lead to atherosclerosis. Quitting or not starting is the only thing that can prevent this major risk factor for heart attack and stroke. Blood pressure awareness Individuals should know what their blood pressure is by having it checked by a practitioner. If it's high, it may be able to be lowered by following a healthy diet and including exercise in their daily routine. If diet and exercise don't lower blood pressure, medication may be needed. Adherence to the medication regimen is foremost in reducing blood pressure and preventing stroke. For a patient who has had a stroke, start rehabilitation at admission. The amount of teaching you'll have to do depends on the extent of neurologic deficit. P If necessary, teach the patient to comb his hair, dress, and wash. With the aid of a physical therapist and an occupational therapist, obtain appliances, such as walking frames, hand bars by the toilet, and ramps, as needed. The patient may fail to recognize that he has a paralyzed side (called unilateral neglect) and must be taught to inspect that side of his body for injury and to protect it from harm. If speech therapy is indicated, encourage the patient to begin as soon as possible and to follow through with the speech pathologist's suggestions. To reinforce teaching, involve the patient's family in all aspects of rehabilitation. With their cooperation and support, devise a realistic discharge plan, and let them help decide when the patient can return home. Before discharge, warn the patient or his family to report any premonitory signs of a stroke, such as severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, and dizziness. Emphasize the importance\\nof regular follow- up visits. If aspirin has been prescribed to minimize\\nthe risk of embolic stroke, tell the patient to watch for possible GI bleeding. Make sure the patient and his family realize that acetaminophen isn't a substitute for aspirin. To help prevent stroke: Stress the need to control diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension. Teach all patients (especially those at high risk) the importance of following a low-cholesterol, low-salt diet;\\nwatching their weight; increasing activity; avoiding smoking and prolonged bed rest; and minimizing stress. (See Preventing stroke , page 195.) Ensure that the patient understands that if symptoms develop, he should go to the emergency department immediately. Meningitis In meningitis, the brain and the spinal cord meninges become inflamed, usually as a result of a viral or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. Such inflammation may involve all three meningeal membranes\\u2014the dura mater, the arachnoid, and the pia mater. Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own in 10 days or less. Bacterial meningitis requires prompt treatment with I.V. antibiotics. Causes and incidence Bacterial meningitis is almost always a complication of another bacterial infection\\u2014bacteremia (especially from pneumonia, empyema, osteomyelitis, or endocarditis), sinusitis, otitis media, encephalitis, myelitis, or brain abscess\\u2014usually caused by Neisseria meningitidis , Haemophilus influenzae (in children and young adults), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (in adults). In some cases, a virus is suspected. (See Lymphocytic choriomeningitis .)\\nMeningitis may also follow skull fracture, a penetrating head wound, lumbar puncture, or ventricular shunting procedure. Aseptic meningitis may result from a virus or other organism. Sometimes, no causative organism can be found. Meningitis commonly begins as an inflammation of the pia-arachnoid, which may progress to congestion of adjacent tissues and destruction of some nerve cells. Incidence of meningitis is high among Blacks and Native Americans. Male infants have a high incidence of gram-negative neonatal meningitis. Complications Visual impairment Optic neuritis Cranial nerve palsies Personality changes Headache Paresis or paralysis Vasculitis Endocarditis Signs and symptoms The cardinal signs of meningitis are infection (fever, chills, and malaise) and increased intracranial pressure (ICP; headache,\\nvomiting and, rarely, papilledema). Signs of meningeal irritation include nuchal rigidity, P positive Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, exaggerated and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, and opisthotonos (a spasm in which the back and extremities arch backward so that the body rests on the head and heels). (See Two signs of meningitis , pages 198 and 199.)\\nOther manifestations of meningitis are irritability; sinus arrhythmias; photophobia, diplopia, and other visual problems; and delirium, deep stupor, and coma. An infant may not show clinical signs of infection but may be fretful and refuse to eat. Such an infant may vomit often, leading to dehydration; this prevents a bulging fontanel and thus masks this important sign of increased ICP. As the illness progresses, twitching, seizures (in 30% of infants), or coma may develop. Most older\\nchildren have the same symptoms as adults. In subacute meningitis, the onset may be insidious. LYMPHOCYTIC CHORIOMENINGITIS Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a mild, biphasic, febrile illness lasting about 2 weeks. Infection occurs through inhalation of the LCM virus or arenavirus from infectious aerosolized particles of the host (rodents such as mice or hamsters) or its excreta (urine, feces, or saliva) 1 to 3 weeks before the onset of symptoms. It can also result from contact with food contaminated with the virus or by\\ncontamination of mucous membranes, skin lesions, or cuts with infected body fluids. Handlers of infected animals or their excreta are at risk for this disease. Most cases occur in the northeast and eastern seaboard\\nareas of the United States. LCM is more common during fall and winter. The incubation period is 8 to 13 days after exposure. Early characteristics include fever, malaise, anorexia, weakness, muscle\\naches, retro-orbital headache, nausea, and vomiting. Sore throat, nonproductive cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain may occur. Meningeal symptoms appear in 15 to 21 days, with signs and symptoms of meningitis (fever, increased headache, and stiff neck) or encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and motor abnormalities such as paralysis). Alopecia may also occur. Complications include temporary or permanent neurologic damage, possible maternal transmission (pregnancy-related infection is associated with spontaneous abortion, congenital hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and mental retardation), myelitis, Guillain- Barr\\u00e9type syndrome, orchitis or parotitis, myocarditis, psychosis, joint pain and arthritis, and prolonged convalescence with continuing dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. Diagnosis is made by detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (the preferred diagnostic test). Lumbarpuncture CSF is typically abnormal and reveals increased opening pressure, increased protein levels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, usually in the range of several hundred white blood cells. Treatment is generally supportive and includes bed rest, anti-inflammatory drugs, and\\nanalgesics. Ribavirin has been shown to be effective against LCM in vitro. Acute hydrocephalus may require surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. Prevention involves teaching rodent control measures, basic hygiene practices, use of a personal respirator, importance of adequate ventilation, and use of a liquid disinfectant, such as a diluted household bleach solution, to clean areas with rodent droppings. Diagnosis P A lumbar puncture showing typical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, when accompanied by positive Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, usually establishes a diagnosis. The following tests can uncover the primary sites of infection: cultures of blood, urine, and nose and throat secretions; chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; and a physical examination, with special attention to skin, ears, and sinuses. Lumbar puncture usually indicates elevated CSF pressure, from obstructed outflow at the arachnoid villi. The fluid may appear cloudy or milky white, depending on the number of white blood cells present. CSF protein\\nlevels tend to be high; glucose levels may be low. (In subacute meningitis, CSF findings may vary.) CSF culture and sensitivity tests usually identify the infecting organism, unless it's a virus. Leukocytosis and serum electrolyte abnormalities are also common. Computed tomography scan can rule out cerebral hematoma, hemorrhage, or tumor. TWO SIGNS OF MENINGITIS Brudzinski's sign: Place the patient in a dorsal recumbent position, put your hands behind her neck, and bend it forward. Pain and resistance may indicate meningeal inflammation, neck injury, or arthritis. If the patient also flexes her hips and knees in response to this manipulation, chances are she has meningitis. Kernig's sign: Place the patient in a supine position. Flex her leg at the hip and knee and then straighten the knee. Pain or resistance points to meningitis. Treatment Treatment of meningitis includes appropriate antibiotic therapy for bacterial meningitis and vigorous supportive care. Usually, I.V. antibiotics are given for at least 2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics. Dexamethasone has been shown to be effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of meningitis caused by H. influenzae type B and in pneumococcal meningitis if given before the first dose of\\nantibiotic. It has also been shown to reduce the incidence of deafness,\\na common complication of meningitis. Other drugs include mannitol to decrease cerebral edema, an anticonvulsant (usually given I.V.) or sedative to reduce restlessness, and aspirin or acetaminophen to relieve headache and fever. Supportive measures include bed rest, fever reduction, and measures to prevent dehydration. The patient's room is kept darkened and\\nquiet because any increase in sensory stimulation may cause a seizure. Isolation is necessary if nasal cultures are positive. Appropriate therapy for any coexisting conditions, such as endocarditis or pneumonia, is included as well. To prevent meningitis, prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used P after ventricular shunting procedures, skull fracture, or penetrating head wounds, but this use is controversial. For viral meningitis, treatment is supportive. Special considerations Patients must be watched carefully for changes in neurologic function or other signs of worsening condition. Assess neurologic function often. Observe level of consciousness (LOC) and signs of increased ICP (plucking at the\\nbedcovers, vomiting, seizures, and a change in motor function and vital\\nsigns). Watch for signs of cranial nerve involvement (ptosis, strabismus, and diplopia). ALERT Be especially alert for a temperature increase up to 102\\u00b0 F (38.9\\u00b0 C), deteriorating LOC, onset of\\nseizures, and altered respirations, all of which may signal an impending crisis. Monitor fluid balance. Maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration, but avoid fluid overload because of the danger of cerebral edema. Measure central venous pressure and intake\\nand output accurately. Watch for adverse effects of I.V. antibiotics and other drugs. To avoid infiltration and phlebitis, check I.V. site often, and change the site according to hospital policy. Position the patient carefully to prevent joint stiffness and neck pain. Turn him often, according to a planned positioning schedule. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. Maintain adequate nutrition and elimination. It may be necessary to provide small, frequent meals or to supplement meals with nasogastric tube or parenteral feedings. To prevent constipation and minimize the risk of increased ICP resulting from straining at stool, give the patient a mild laxative or stool softener. P Ensure the patient's comfort. Provide mouth care regularly. Maintain a quiet environment. Darkening the room may decrease photophobia. Relieve headache with a nonopioid analgesic, such as aspirin or acetaminophen as ordered. (Opioids interfere with accurate neurologic assessment.) Provide reassurance and support. The patient may be frightened by his illness and frequent lumbar punctures. If he's delirious or confused, attempt to reorient him often. Reassure his family that the delirium and behavior changes caused by meningitis usually disappear. However, if a severe neurologic deficit appears permanent, refer the patient to a rehabilitation program as soon as the acute phase of this illness has passed. To help prevent development of meningitis,\\nteach patients with chronic sinusitis or other chronic infections the importance of proper medical treatment. Follow strict sterile technique when treating patients with head wounds or skull fractures. PREVENTION Give Haemophilus influenzae Type B and pneumococcal vaccines to children. Give meningococcal vaccine to college students. Give prophylactic antibiotics to those who have been exposed to a patient with meningitis. Encephalitis Encephalitis is a severe inflammation of the brain, commonly caused by a mosquito-borne or, in some areas, a tick-borne virus. However, transmission by means other than arthropod bites may occur through ingestion of infected goat's milk and accidental injection\\nor inhalation of the virus. Person-to-person, airborne transmission of viruses (such as measles or mumps) may also lead to encephalitis in nonimmunized populations. Eastern equine encephalitis may produce permanent neurologic damage and is commonly fatal. (See Types of encephalitis, pages 201 to 203.) In encephalitis, intense lymphocytic infiltration of brain tissues and the leptomeninges causes cerebral edema, degeneration of the brain's ganglion cells, and diffuse nerve cell destruction. Causes and incidence Encephalitis typically results from infection with arboviruses specific to rural areas. However, in urban areas, it's most frequently caused by enteroviruses (coxsackievirus, poliovirus, and echovirus) and flaviviruses (West Nile virus). Other causes include herpesvirus, mumps virus, human immunodeficiency virus, adenoviruses, rabies, and demyelinating diseases after measles, varicella, rubella, or\\nvaccination. Complications Bronchial pneumonia Urine retention Urinary tract infection Pressure ulcers Seizure disorder Parkinsonism Mental deterioration Coma Signs and symptoms All viral forms of encephalitis have similar clinical features, although certain differences do occur. Usually, the acute illness begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting and progresses to include signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation (stiff neck and back) and neuronal damage (drowsiness, coma, paralysis, seizures, ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, and organic psychoses). After the acute phase of the illness, coma may persist for days or weeks. The severity of arbovirus encephalitis may range from subclinical to rapidly fatal necrotizing disease. Herpes encephalitis also produces signs and symptoms that vary from subclinical to acute and\\ncommonly fatal P fulminating disease. Associated effects include disturbances of taste or smell. Diagnosis During an encephalitis epidemic, diagnosis is readily made on clinical findings and patient history. However, sporadic cases are difficult to distinguish from other febrile illnesses, such as gastroenteritis or meningitis. Diagnosis may be assisted by serologic assays, such as immunoglobulin (Ig) Mcapture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) and Ig ELISA. Early in infection, IgM antibody is more specific, whereas later,\\nIgG is more reactive. Monoclonal antibody studies show promise in diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction is also being investigated. When possible, identification of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood confirms this diagnosis. The common viruses that also cause herpes, measles, and mumps are easier to identify than arboviruses. Both herpesviruses and arboviruses can be isolated by inoculating young mice with a specimen taken from the patient. In herpes encephalitis, serologic studies may show rising titers of complement-fixing antibodies. In all forms of encephalitis, CSF pressure is elevated and despite inflammation, the fluid is usually clear. White blood cell and protein levels in CSF are slightly elevated, but the glucose level remains normal. An EEG reveals abnormalities. Occasionally, a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging may be ordered to rule out\\ncerebral hematoma. Treatment The antiviral acyclovir must be prescribed for herpes encephalitis. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the infection is thought to be caused by bacteria. Treatment of all other forms of encephalitis is entirely supportive. Drug therapy includes phenytoin or another anticonvulsant, usually given I.V.; steroids such as dexamethasone to reduce cerebral inflammation and edema; corticosteroids; mannitol to reduce cerebral swelling (although the evidence for benefit is weak); sedatives for restlessness; and aspirin or acetaminophen to relieve headache and reduce fever. Ribavirin and interferon alpha-2b were found to have some effect on West Nile encephalitis. Other supportive measures include adequate fluid and electrolyte intake to prevent dehydration and antibiotics for an associated infection such as pneumonia. Isolation is unnecessary. (See Preventing mosquito-borne encephalitis. ) TYPES OF ENCEPHALITIS Four main virus agents cause most cases of encephalitis in the United States: eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis, all of which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Another virus, Powassan (POW), is a minor cause of encephalitis in the northern United\\nStates; this virus is transmitted by ticks. Most cases of arboviral encephalitis occur from June through September, when arthropods are most\\nactive. In milder parts of the country, where arthropods are active late into the year, cases can occur into the winter months. No vaccines are available for these U.S.-based diseases. However, a Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine is available for those who\\nwill be traveling to Japan, a tick-borne encephalitis vaccine is available for those who will be traveling to Europe, and an equine vaccine is available for EEE, WEE, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill larvae and adult mosquitoes as well as controlling standing water that can provide mosquito breeding sites. Eastern equine encephalitis EEE is caused by an alphavirus virus transmitted to humans and horses by the bite of an infected mosquito. Incubation is 4 to 10 days. Symptoms begin with a sudden onset of fever, general muscle pains, and a headache of increasing severity; can progress to seizures and coma. One-third of those afflicted will die from\\nthe disease and of those who recover, many will suffer irreversible brain damage requiring care. Human cases are usually preceded by outbreaks in horses. The virus occurs in natural cycles involving birds in swampy areas nearly every year during the warm months. The virus doesn't escape from these areas, however, and this mosquito doesn't usually bite humans or other mammals. Western equine encephalitis The alphavirus WEE is the causative agent. The virus is closely related to the EEE and VEE viruses The enzootic cycle of WEE involves passerine birds, in which the infection is inapparent, and culicine mosquitoes, principally Culex tarsalis , a species associated with irrigated agriculture and stream drainages. Human WEE cases are usually first seen in June or July. Most WEE infections are asymptomatic or present as mild, nonspecific illness. Patients with clinically apparent illness usually have a sudden onset with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and malaise, followed by altered mental status, weakness, and signs of meningeal irritation. Children, especially those younger than age 1, are affected more severely than adults and may be left with permanent sequelae, which are seen in 5% to 30% of young patients. P 2 Mortality is about 3%. St. Louis encephalitis The leading cause of St. Louis encephalitis is flaviviral. St. Louis encephalitis is the most common mosquito- transmitted human pathogen in the United States. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on birds infected with the St. Louis encephalitis virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The virus grows both in the infected mosquito and the infected bird, but doesn't make either one sick. Less than 1% of St. Louis encephalitis viral infections are clinically apparent; the majority are undiagnosed. Illness ranges in severity from a simple febrile headache to meningoencephalitis, with an overall case- fatality ratio of 5% to 15%. The incubation period is 5 to 15 days. Mild infections present with fever and headache. More severe infection is marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions\\n(especially in infants), and spastic (but rarely flaccid) paralysis. The disease is generally milder in children than in adults, but in those children who do have disease, there's a high rate of encephalitis. Elderly people are at highest risk for severe disease and death. During the summer season, St. Louis encephalitis virus is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle, with periodic amplification by peridomestic birds and Culex mosquitoes. La Crosse encephalitis The LAC virus, a bunyavirus, is a zoonotic pathogen cycled between the daytime-biting tree hole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus ,\\nand vertebrate amplifier hosts (chipmunks, tree squirrels) in deciduous\\nforest habitats. The virus is maintained over the winter by transmission in mosquito eggs. If the female mosquito is infected, she may lay eggs that carry the virus. Vector uses artificial containers (tires, buckets, and so forth) in addition to tree holes. LAC encephalitis initially presents as a nonspecific summertime illness with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Severe disease occurs most commonly in children younger than age 16 and is characterized by seizures, coma, paralysis, and a variety of neurological sequelae after recovery. Death occurs in less than 1% of clinical cases. Cases are often reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis of unknown etiology. During an average year, about 75 cases of LAC encephalitis are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Powassan encephalitis The POW virus is a flavivirus. Recently a Powassan-like virus was isolated from the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis . The virus has been recovered from ticks ( Ixodes marxi and Dermacentor andersoni ) and from the tissues of an eastern spotted skunk. P 3 It's a rare cause of acute viral encephalitis. Patients who recover may have residual neurologic problems. Venezuelan equine encephalitis Like EEE and WEE viruses, VEE is an alphavirus that causes encephalitis in horses and humans. VEE is a significant veterinary and public health problem in Central and South America. Infection of humans with the VEE virus is less severe than with EEE and WEE viruses, and fatalities are rare. Adults usually develop only an influenza-like illness; overt encephalitis is usually confined to children. Effective VEE virus vaccines are available for equines. Japanese encephalitis JE virus, which is related to St. Louis encephalitis, is a flavivirus. It's widespread throughout Asia. Epidemics occur in late summer in temperate regions, but the infection is enzootic and occurs throughout the year in many tropical areas of Asia. The virus is maintained in a cycle involving culicine mosquitoes and waterbirds. It's transmitted to humans by Culex mosquitoes, primarily Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which breed in rice fields. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on domestic pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The virus is amplified in domestic pigs and wild birds. The incubation period is 5 to 14 days. Mild infections occur without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infection is marked\\nby quick onset, headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional seizures (especially in infants), and spastic (but rarely flaccid) paralysis. The illness resolves in 5 to 7 days if there's no central nervous system involvement. The mortality is less than 10%, but is higher in children and can exceed 30%. Neurologic sequelae in patients who recover are reported in up to 30% of cases. A vaccine is currently available for human use in the United States for individuals who might be traveling to endemic countries. Tick-borne encephalitis Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by\\ntwo closely related flaviviruses. The eastern subtype causes Russian spring-summer encephalitis (RSSE) and is transmitted by Ixodes persulcatus, whereas the western subtype is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus and causes Central European encephalitis (CEE). RSSE is the more severe infection, having a\\nmortality of up to 25% in some outbreaks, whereas mortality in CEE seldom exceeds 5%. The incubation period is 7 to 14 days. Infection usually presents as a mild, influenza-type illness or as benign, aseptic meningitis, but may result in fatal meningoencephalitis. Fever is often biphasic, and there may be severe headache and neck rigidity, with transient paralysis of the limbs, shoulders or, less commonly, the respiratory musculature. A few patients are left with residual paralysis. Although the great majority of TBE infections follow exposure to ticks, infection has occurred through the ingestion of infected cows' or goats' milk. An inactivated TBE vaccine is currently available in Europe and Russia. West Nile encephalitis West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex that includes the closely related St. Louis encephalitis virus, Kunjin, and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses, as well as others. St. Louis encephalitis and WNE viruses are related. WNV can infect a wide range of vertebrates; in humans it usually produces either asymptomatic infection\\nor mild febrile disease, but can cause severe and fatal infection in a small percentage of patients. The incubation period is thought to range from 3 to 14 days. Symptoms generally last 3 to 6 days. Like St. Louis encephalitis virus, WNV is transmitted principally by Culex species mosquitoes, but also can be transmitted by Aedes , Anopheles , and other species. The mild form of WNV infection has presented as a febrile illness of sudden onset often accompanied by malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, eye pain, headache, myalgia, rash, and lymphadenopathy. A minority of patients with severe disease\\ndevelop a maculopapular or morbilliform rash involving the neck, trunk,\\narms, or legs. Some patients experience severe muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis. Neurological presentations include ataxia, cranial nerve P abnormalities, myelitis, optic neuritis, polyradiculitis, and seizures. Although not observed in recent outbreaks, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and fulminant hepatitis have been described. Murray Valley encephalitis MVE is endemic in New Guinea and in parts of Australia. It's related to the St. Louis encephalitis, WN, and JE viruses. Infections are common, and the small number of fatalities have mostly been in children. PREVENTING MOSQUITO-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS Help patients prevent mosquito-borne encephalitis by urging them to follow these steps: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if going outside between dusk and dawn. A mosquito repellent with a 10% to 30% concentration of N, N-diethylmeta-toluamide (DEET) is recommended and should be applied to skin and clothing. Don't use DEET on the hands of young children or on infants under 2 months of age. Cover an infant's stroller or playpen with mosquito netting when outside. Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes are most prevalent. Repair holes in screens on doors and windows to prevent mosquitos from entering the home. Eliminate areas that attract mosquitoes, such as standing water in birdbaths, wheelbarrows, flower pots, old tires, and unused containers. These items are excellent breeding areas for mosquitoes. P Special considerations During the acute phase of the illness: Assess neurologic function often. Observe level of consciousness and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (increasing restlessness, plucking at the bedcovers, vomiting, seizures, and changes in pupil size, motor function, and vital signs\\u2014such as rising blood pressure, widening pulse pressure, and slowly\\nfalling pulse). Watch for cranial nerve involvement (ptosis, strabismus, and diplopia), abnormal sleep patterns, and behavior changes. Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration, but avoid fluid overload, which may increase cerebral edema. Measure and record intake and output accurately and assess daily weights. Carefully position the patient to prevent joint stiffness and neck pain, and turn him often. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. Maintain adequate nutrition. It may be necessary to give the patient small, frequent meals or to supplement meals with nasogastric tube or parenteral feedings. To prevent constipation and minimize the risk of increased ICP resulting from straining at stool, give a mild laxative or stool softener. Provide mouth care. Maintain a quiet environment. Darkening the room may decrease photophobia and headache. If the patient naps during the day and is restless at night, plan daytime activities to minimize napping and promote sleep at night. Provide emotional support and reassurance because the patient is apt to be frightened by the illness and frequent diagnostic tests. If the patient is delirious or confused, attempt to reorient him often. Providing a calendar or a clock in the patient's room may be helpful. Reassure the patient and his family that behavior changes caused by encephalitis usually disappear. If a neurologic deficit is severe and appears permanent, refer the patient to\\na rehabilitation program as soon as the acute phase has passed. Brain abscess Brain abscess, also known as an intracranial abscess, is a free or encapsulated collection of pus usually in the temporal lobe, cerebellum, or frontal lobes. It can vary in size and may occur singly or in more than one location. Untreated brain abscess is usually fatal; even with treatment, the prognosis is only fair, and about 30% of patients develop\\nfocal seizures. Multiple metastatic abscesses secondary to systemic or other infections have the poorest prognosis. Causes and incidence Brain abscess is usually secondary to some other infection, especially otitis media, sinusitis, dental abscess, and mastoiditis. Other causes include subdural empyema; bacterial endocarditis; human immunodeficiency virus infection; bacteremia; pulmonary or pleural infection; pelvic, abdominal, and skin infections; and cranial trauma, such as a penetrating head wound or compound skull fracture. Brain abscess also occurs in those with congenital heart disease and congenital blood vessel abnormalities of the lungs such as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. These disorders carry a high risk of infection of the heart or lungs, which can then spread to the brain. Penetrating head trauma or bacteremia usually leads to staphylococcal infection; pulmonary disease, to streptococcal infection. Brain abscess usually begins with localized inflammatory necrosis and edema, septic thrombosis of vessels, and suppurative encephalitis. This is followed by thick encapsulation of accumulated pus\\nand adjacent meningeal infiltration by neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Brain abscess has a relatively low incidence. It has a 10% mortality rate. Signs and symptoms Onset varies according to cause, but generally brain abscess produces clinical effects similar to those of a brain tumor. Early symptoms result P from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and include constant intractable headache, worsened by straining; nausea; vomiting; and focal or generalized seizures. Typical later symptoms include ocular disturbances, such as nystagmus, decreased vision, and unequal pupil size. Other features differ with the site of the abscess: temporal lobe abscess: auditory-receptive dysphasia, central facial weakness, and hemiparesis cerebellar abscess: dizziness, coarse nystagmus, gaze weakness on lesion side, tremor, and ataxia frontal lobe abscess: expressive dysphasia, hemiparesis with unilateral motor seizure, drowsiness, inattention, and mental function impairment. Signs of infection, such as fever, pallor, and bradycardia, are absent until late stages unless they result from the predisposing condition. If the abscess is encapsulated, they may never appear. Depending on abscess size and location, level of consciousness (LOC) varies from drowsiness to deep stupor. Diagnosis A history of infection\\u2014especially of the middle ear, mastoid, nasal sinuses, heart, or lungs\\u2014or a history of congenital heart\\ndisease, along with a physical examination showing such characteristic clinical features as increased ICP, points to brain abscess. A computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, occasionally, arteriography (which highlights brain abscess by a halo) help locate the site. Blood culture will reveal any bacteria in the blood stream. Chest X- ray may reveal lung infection. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid can help confirm infection, but lumbar puncture is risky because it can release the increased ICP and provoke cerebral herniation. A CT-guided stereotactic biopsy may be performed to drain and culture the abscess. Other tests include culture and sensitivity of drainage to identify the causative organism, skull X-rays, and a radioisotope scan. Treatment Management of patients with brain abscess has become increasingly challenging because of the proliferation of unusual bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Therapy consists of antibiotics to combat the underlying infection and surgical aspiration or drainage of the abscess. Surgical drainage or excision may be performed (CT scan or MRI can help determine the need for these procedures). Antimicrobials may be\\ninjected directly into the mass. Administration of antibiotics for at least 2 weeks before surgery can reduce the risk of spreading infection. Other treatments during the acute phase are palliative and supportive and include mechanical ventilation, administration of I.V. fluids with diuretics (urea or mannitol), and glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) to combat increased ICP and cerebral edema. Anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, help prevent seizures. Special considerations The patient with an acute brain abscess requires intensive monitoring. Frequently assess neurologic status, especially LOC, speech, and sensorimotor and cranial nerve functions. Watch for signs of increased ICP (decreased LOC, vomiting, abnormal pupil response, and depressed respirations), which may lead to cerebral herniation with such signs as fixed and dilated pupils, widened pulse pressure, bradycardia or tachycardia, and absent respirations. Assess and record vital signs at least every hour. Monitor fluid intake and output carefully because fluid overload can contribute to cerebral edema. If surgery is necessary, explain the procedure to the patient and answer his questions. After surgery: Continue frequent neurologic assessment. Monitor vital signs and intake and output. Watch for signs of meningitis (nuchal rigidity, headaches, chills, and sweats), an ever-present threat. Be sure to change a damp dressing often, using sterile technique and noting the amount of drainage. Never allow bandages to remain damp. To promote drainage and prevent reaccumulation of purulent material in the abscess, position the patient on the operative side. If the patient remains stuporous or comatose for an extended period, give meticulous skin care to prevent pressure ulcers, and position him to preserve function and prevent contractures. Encourage the patient to ambulate as soon as possible to prevent immobility and encourage independence. PREVENTION Stress the need for treatment of otitis media, mastoiditis, dental abscess, and other infections. Give prophylactic antibiotics after compound skull fracture or penetrating head wound. Huntington's disease Also called Huntington's chorea, hereditary chorea, chronic progressive chorea, or adult chorea, Huntington's disease is a hereditary disease in which degeneration in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia causes chronic progressive chorea and mental deterioration, ending in dementia. Causes and incidence Huntingdon's disease is inherited as a single faulty gene\\non chromosome #4 whereby part of the gene is repeated in multiple copies. It's transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait; either sex can transmit and inherit it. Each child of a parent with this disease has a 50% chance of inheriting it. The disease usually strikes people between ages 35 and 55; however, 2% of cases occur in children, and 5% of cases occur as late as age 60. Death usually results 10 to 15 years after onset, from suicide, heart failure, or P pneumonia. Genetic testing is available for persons with a family history of the disease. Complications Aspiration Pneumonia Heart failure Infections Signs and symptoms Onset is insidious. The patient eventually becomes totally dependent\\u2014 emotionally and physically\\u2014through loss of musculoskeletal control, and he develops progressively severe choreic movements. Such movements are rapid, usually violent, and purposeless. Initially, they're unilateral and more prominent in the face and arms than in the legs, progressing from mild fidgeting to grimacing, tongue smacking, dysarthria (indistinct speech), athetoid movements (especially\\nof the hands) related to emotional state, and torticollis. Ultimately, the patient with Huntington's disease develops progressive dementia, although the dementia doesn't always progress at the same rate as the chorea. Dementia can be mild at first, but eventually causes severe disruption of the personality. Personality changes include obstinacy, carelessness, untidiness, moodiness, apathy, inappropriate behavior, loss of memory and concentration and, occasionally, paranoia. Diagnosis Huntington's disease can be detected by positron emission\\ntomography and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis. Diagnosis is based on a characteristic clinical history: progressive chorea and dementia, onset in early middle age (35 to 40), and confirmation of a genetic link. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate brain atrophy. Molecular genetics may detect the gene for Huntington's disease in people at risk while they're still asymptomatic. Treatment Because Huntington's disease has no known cure, treatment\\nis supportive, protective, and symptomatic. Dopamine blockers, such as phenothiazine or haloperidol, help control choreic movements and reduce abnormal behaviors. Reserpine and other drugs have been used with varying success with choreic movements and reduced abnormal behavior. Drugs, such as tetrabenazine and amantadine, are used to control extra movements. Some evidence suggests that co-enzyme Q10 may minimally decrease progression of the disease. Institutionalization may be necessary because of mental deterioration, which can't be halted or managed by drugs. Special considerations Patient comfort and support are the primary considerations. Provide physical support by attending to the patient's basic needs, such as hygiene, skin care, bowel and bladder\\ncare, and nutrition. Increase this support as mental and physical deterioration make him increasingly immobile. Offer emotional support to the patient and\\nhis family. Teach them about the disease, and listen to their concerns and special problems. Keep in mind the patient's dysarthria, and allow him extra time to express himself, thereby decreasing frustration. Teach\\nthe family to participate in the patient's care. Stay alert for possible suicide attempts. Control the patient's environment to protect him from suicide or other self-inflicted injury. Pad the side rails of the bed, but avoid restraints, which may cause the patient to injure himself with violent, uncontrolled movements. If the patient has difficulty walking, provide a walker to help him maintain his balance. Make sure affected families receive genetic counseling. All affected family members should realize that each\\nof their offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting this disease. Refer people at risk who desire genetic testing to centers specializing in Huntington's care, where psychosocial\\nsupport is available. P Refer the patient and his family to the appropriate community organizations. For more information about this degenerative disease, refer the patient and his family to the Huntington's Disease Society of America. Parkinson's disease Named for James Parkinson, the English physician who wrote the first accurate description of the disease in 1817, Parkinson's\\ndisease characteristically produces progressive muscle rigidity, akinesia, involuntary tremor, and dementia. Death may result from aspiration pneumonia or an infection. Causes and incidence Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, study of the extrapyramidal brain nuclei (corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra) has established that a dopamine deficiency prevents affected brain cells from performing their normal inhibitory function within the central nervous system. Parkinson's disease occurs in families in some cases. Parkinson's disease, also called parkinsonism, paralysis agitans, and shaking palsy, is one of the most common crippling diseases in the United States. Parkinson's disease strikes 2 in every 1,000 people, most often developing in those older than age 50;\\nhowever, it also occurs in children and young adults. Because of increased longevity, this amounts to roughly 60,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone. Incidence increases in persons with\\nrepeated brain injury, including professional athletes, and persons using psychoactive substances, whether prescribed or illicit. Complications Injury from falls Aspiration Urinary tract infections Skin breakdown Signs and symptoms The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease are muscle rigidity and akinesia and an insidious resting tremor that begins in the\\nfingers (unilateral pill-roll tremor), increases during stress or anxiety, and decreases with purposeful movement and sleep. Muscle rigidity results in resistance to passive muscle stretching, which may be uniform (lead- pipe rigidity) or jerky (cogwheel rigidity). Akinesia causes the patient to walk with difficulty (gait lacks normal parallel motion and may be retropulsive or propulsive) and produces a high-pitched, monotone voice; drooling; a masklike facial expression; loss of posture control (the patient walks with body bent forward); and dysarthria, dysphagia, or both. Occasionally, akinesia may also cause oculogyric crises (eyes are fixed upward, with involuntary tonic movements) or blepharospasm (eyelids are completely closed). Parkinson's\\ndisease itself doesn't impair the intellect, but a coexisting disorder,\\nsuch as arteriosclerosis, may do so. Diagnosis Generally, laboratory data are of little value in identifying Parkinson's disease; consequently, diagnosis is based on the\\npatient's age, history, and characteristic clinical picture. Conclusive diagnosis is possible only after ruling out other causes of tremor, involutional depression, cerebral arteriosclerosis and, in patients younger than age 30, intracranial tumors, Wilson's disease, or phenothiazine or other drug toxicity. Treatment Because Parkinson's disease has no cure, the primary aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms and keep the patient functional as long as possible. Treatment consists of drugs, physical therapy and, in severe disease states unresponsive to drugs, stereotactic neurosurgery or the controversial treatment called fetal cell transplantation. In this treatment, fetal brain tissue is injected into the patient's brain.\\nIf the injected cells grow within the recipient's brain, they will allow the brain P to process dopamine, thereby either halting or reversing\\ndisease progression. Neurotransplantation techniques, including the use\\nof nerve cells from other parts of the patient's body, have been attempted with varying results. Drug therapy usually includes levodopa, a dopamine replacement that's most effective during early stages. It's given in increasing doses until symptoms are relieved or adverse effects appear. Because adverse effects can be serious, levodopa is usually given in combination with carbidopa to halt peripheral dopamine synthesis. Occasionally, levodopa proves ineffective, producing dangerous adverse effects that include postural hypotension, hallucinations, and increased libido leading to inappropriate sexual behavior. In that case, alternative drug therapy includes anticholinergics such as trihexyphenidyl, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, and amantadine, an antiviral agent. Research on the oxidative stress theory has caused a controversy in drug therapy for Parkinson's disease. Traditionally, levodopa-carbidopa has been a first-line drug in management; however, it\\nhas also been associated with an acceleration of disease process. Inclusion of entacapone potentiates the effects of levodopa-carbidopa treatment so that less frequent doses are required. Selegiline, an enzyme-inhibiting agent, allows conservation of dopamine and enhances the therapeutic effect of levodopa. Selegiline used with tocopherols delays the time when the patient with Parkinson's disease becomes disabled. ELDER TIP Elderly patients may need smaller doses of antiparkinsonian drugs because of reduced tolerance. Be alert for and report orthostatic hypotension, irregular pulse, blepharospasm, and anxiety or confusion. When drug therapy fails, stereotactic neurosurgery, such as subthalamotomy and pallidotomy, may be an alternative. In these procedures, electrical coagulation, freezing, radioactivity, or ultrasound destroys the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus to prevent involuntary movement. This is most effective in young, otherwise healthy people with unilateral tremor or muscle rigidity. Neurosurgery can only relieve symptoms. Brain stimulator implantation alters the activity of the area where Parkinson's disease symptoms originate. A pacemaker is implanted into the chest wall, and the electrode is threaded (using magnetic resonance imaging for guidance) to the thalamus, pallidum, or subthalamic nucleus. A successful procedure reduces the need for medication, thus reducing the medication-related adverse effects experienced by the patient. Individually planned physical therapy complements drug treatment and neurosurgery to maintain normal muscle tone and function. Appropriate physical therapy includes both active and passive range-of-motion exercises, routine daily activities, walking, and baths and massage to help relax muscles. Special considerations Effectively caring for the patient with Parkinson's disease requires careful monitoring of drug treatment, emphasis on teaching self- reliance, and generous psychological support. Monitor drug treatment and adjust dosage, if necessary, to minimize adverse effects. If the patient has surgery, watch for signs of hemorrhage and increased intracranial pressure by frequently checking level of consciousness and vital signs. Encourage independence. The patient with excessive tremor may achieve partial control of his body by sitting on a\\nchair and using its arms to steady himself. Advise the patient to change position slowly and dangle his legs before getting out of bed. Remember that fatigue may cause him to depend more on others. Help the patient overcome problems related\\nto eating and elimination. For example, if he has difficulty eating, offer supplementary or small, frequent meals to increase caloric intake. Help establish a regular bowel routine by encouraging him to drink at least 2 qt (about 2 L) of liquids daily and eat high-fiber foods. He may need an elevated toilet seat to assist him from a standing to a sitting position. P Give the patient and his family emotional support. Teach them about the disease, its progressive stages, and drug adverse effects. Show the family how to prevent pressure ulcers and contractures by proper positioning. Inform them of the dietary restrictions levodopa imposes, and explain household safety measures to prevent accidents. Help the patient and his family express their feelings and frustrations about the progressively debilitating effects of the disease. Establish long- and short-term treatment goals, and be aware of the patient's need for intellectual stimulation and diversion. Refer the patient and his family to the National Parkinson Foundation or the United Parkinson Foundation for more information. Myelitis and acute transverse myelitis Myelitis, or inflammation of the spinal cord, can result from several diseases. Poliomyelitis affects the cord's gray matter and produces motor dysfunction; leukomyelitis affects only the white matter and produces sensory dysfunction. These types of myelitis can attack any\\nlevel of the spinal cord, causing partial destruction or scattered lesions. Acute transverse myelitis, which affects the entire thickness of the spinal cord, produces both motor and sensory dysfunctions. It has\\na rapid onset and is the most devastating form of myelitis. The prognosis depends on the severity of cord damage and prevention of complications. If spinal cord necrosis occurs, prognosis for complete recovery is poor. Even without necrosis, residual neurologic deficits usually persist after recovery. Patients who develop\\nspastic reflexes early in the course of the illness are more likely to recover than those who don't. Causes and incidence Acute transverse myelitis has a variety of causes. It commonly follows acute infectious diseases, such as measles or pneumonia\\n(the inflammation occurs after the infection has subsided), and primary infections of the spinal cord itself, such as syphilis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Acute transverse myelitis can accompany demyelinating diseases, such as an acute exacerbation of multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory and necrotizing disorders of the spinal cord such as hematomyelia. Certain toxic agents (carbon monoxide, lead, and arsenic)\\ncan cause a type of myelitis in which acute inflammation (followed by hemorrhage and possible necrosis) destroys the entire circumference (myelin, axis cylinders, and neurons) of the spinal cord. Other forms of\\nmyelitis may result from poliovirus, herpes zoster, herpesvirus B, or rabies virus; disorders that cause meningeal inflammation, such as syphilis, abscesses and other suppurative conditions, and tuberculosis; smallpox or polio vaccination; parasitic and fungal infections; and chronic adhesive arachnoiditis. Peak incidence occurs between ages 10 and 19, then again between ages 30 and 39. Approximately 1,400 new cases are diagnosed each\\nyear in the United States. About 33,000 Americans have some type of disability from this disorder. Complications Hypertension Urinary tract infection Urolithiasis Pneumonia Skeletal and smooth muscle deformities Myocarditis Paralytic ileus Signs and symptoms In acute transverse myelitis, onset is rapid, with motor and sensory dysfunctions below the level of spinal cord damage appearing\\nin 1 to 2 days. Patients with acute transverse myelitis develop flaccid paralysis of the legs (sometimes beginning in just one leg) with loss of\\nsensory and sphincter functions. Such sensory loss may follow pain in the legs or trunk. Reflexes disappear in the early stages but may reappear later. P The extent of damage depends on the level of the spinal cord affected; transverse myelitis seldom involves the arms. If spinal cord damage is severe, it may cause shock (hypotension and hypothermia). Diagnosis Paraplegia of rapid onset usually points to acute transverse myelitis. In such patients, neurologic examination confirms paraplegia or neurologic deficit below the level of the spinal cord lesion and absent (or, in later stages) hyperactive reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid may be normal or show increased lymphocytes or elevated protein levels. Diagnostic evaluation must rule out spinal cord\\ntumor and identify the cause of any underlying infection. Treatment No effective treatment exists for acute transverse myelitis. However, this condition requires appropriate treatment of any underlying infection. Some patients with postinfectious or multiple sclerosis-induced myelitis have received steroid therapy, but its benefits aren't clear. Special considerations Managing symptoms and treating the underlying infection are the primary considerations. Frequently assess vital signs. Watch carefully for signs of spinal shock (hypotension and excessive sweating). Prevent contractures with range-of-motion exercises and proper alignment. Watch for signs of urinary tract infections from indwelling urinary catheters. Prevent skin infections and pressure ulcers with meticulous skin care. Check pressure points often and keep skin clean and dry; use a low- pressure specialty or rotational bed or other pressure-relieving device. Initiate rehabilitation immediately. Assist the patient with physical therapy, bowel and bladder training, and the lifestyle changes his condition requires. Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease, also called primary degenerative dementia, accounts for more than half of all dementias. It results in memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, personality changes, disorientation,\\nand loss of language skills. Because this is a primary progressive dementia, the prognosis for a patient with this disease is poor. Causes and incidence The cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown; however, several factors are thought to be implicated in this disease. These include neurochemical factors, such as deficiencies in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, somatostatin, substance P, and norepinephrine; environmental factors; and genetic immunologic factors. Genetic studies show that an autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease is associated with early onset and early death, accounting for about 100,000 deaths a year. A family history of Alzheimer's disease and\\nthe presence of Down syndrome are two established risk factors. Alzheimer's disease isn't exclusive to the elder population; its onset begins in middle age in 1% to 10% of cases The brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease has\\nthree hallmark features: neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and\\ngranulovascular degeneration. Examination of the brain after death also\\nfinds that it's atrophic, commonly weighing less than 1,000 g, compared\\nwith a normal brain weight of about 1,380 g. About 360,000 new cases of Alzheimer's are diagnosed each year. Complications Injury Pneumonia Infection P Malnutrition Dehydration Signs and symptoms Onset is insidious. Initially, the patient undergoes almost imperceptible changes, such as forgetfulness, recent memory loss,\\ndifficulty learning and remembering new information, deterioration in personal hygiene and appearance, and an inability to concentrate. Gradually, tasks that require abstract thinking and activities that require judgment become more difficult. Progressive difficulty in communication and severe deterioration in memory, language, and motor function result in a loss of coordination and an inability to write or speak. Personality changes (restlessness, irritability) and nocturnal awakenings are common. Patients also exhibit loss of eye contact, a fearful look, wringing of the hands, and other signs of anxiety. When a patient with Alzheimer's disease is overwhelmed with anxiety, he becomes dysfunctional, acutely confused, agitated, compulsive, or fearful. Eventually, the patient becomes disoriented, and emotional lability and physical and intellectual disability progress. The patient becomes susceptible to infection and accidents. Usually, death results from infection. ORGANIC BRAIN SYNDROME Although many behavioral disturbances are clearly linked to organic brain dysfunction, the clinical syndromes associated with this type of impairment are sometimes hard to detect because they aren't\\nalways determined by the affected area of the brain or even by the extent of tissue damage. Instead, the way the patient's personality interacts with the brain injury determines the specific clinical effects. General symptoms often include impairment of orientation, memory, and intellectual and emotional function. These primary cognitive\\ndeficits help to distinguish organic brain syndromes from neurosis and depression. Diagnosis Diagnosis of an organic brain syndrome depends on a detailed history of the onset of cognitive and behavioral disturbances; a\\ncomplete neurologic assessment; and such tests as EEG, computed tomography scans, brain X- rays, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and psychological studies. Organic brain syndromes are classified by etiology and specific clinical effects. Causes include infection, brain trauma, nutritional deficiency, cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disease, tumor, toxins, and metabolic or endocrine disorders. Treatment Effective treatment requires correction of the underlying cause. Special considerations may include reality orientation, emotional support for the patient and his family, a safe environment, mat therapy for an agitated or aggressive patient, and referral for psychological counseling. Diagnosis Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is difficult because the patient's signs and symptoms are subtle. (See Organic brain syndrome .)\\nDiagnosis relies on an accurate history from a reliable family member, mental status and neurologic examinations, and psychometric testing. A positron emission tomography scan measures the metabolic activity of the\\ncerebral cortex and may help in early diagnosis. An EEG and a computed tomography scan may help in later diagnosis. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by exclusion; that is, tests are performed to rule out other disorders. The presence of Alzheimer's can't be confirmed until death, when pathologic findings are revealed at autopsy. Treatment P Therapy consists of attempts to slow disease progression,\\nmanage behavioral problems, modify the home environment, and elicit family support. Some medications have proven helpful. Tacrine, a centrally acting anticholinesterase agent, is given to treat memory deficits. It has slowed progression of the disease and improved cognitive function in some patients. Other agents include donepezil and rivastigmine. Underlying disorders that contribute to the patient's confusion, such as hypoxia, are also identified and treated. Special considerations Overall care is focused on supporting the patient's remaining abilities and compensating for those lost. Establish an effective communication system with the patient and his family to help them adjust to the patient's altered cognitive abilities. Offer emotional support to the patient and\\nhis family members. Behavior problems may be worsened by excess stimulation or change in established routine. Teach them about the disease, and refer them to social service and community resources for legal and financial advice and support. Anxiety may cause the patient to become agitated or fearful. Intervene by helping him focus on another activity. Provide the patient with a safe environment. Encourage him to exercise, as ordered, to help maintain mobility. UNDERSTANDING vCJD Like conventional Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the variant of the disease (vCJD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease. Most cases have been reported in the United Kingdom. vCJD is most likely caused by exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)\\u2014a fatal brain disease in cattle also known as mad cow disease \\u2014via ingestion of beef products from cattle with BSE. vCJD affects patients at a much younger age (younger than\\nage 55) than CJD, and the duration of the illness is much longer (14 months). Regulations have been established in Europe to control outbreaks of BSE in cattle and to prevent contaminated meat from entering the food supply. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\nand the World Health Organization are still exploring vCJD and its relationship to BSE. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, rapidly progressive viral disease that attacks the central nervous system, causing dementia and neurologic signs and symptoms, such as myoclonic jerking, ataxia, aphasia, visual disturbances, and paralysis. CJD is always fatal. A new variant of CJD (vCJD) emerged in Europe in 1996. (See Understanding vCJD .) Causes and incidence The causative organism is difficult to identify because no foreign ribonucleic acid or deoxyribonucleic acid has been linked to the disease. CJD is believed to be caused by a specific protein called a\\nprion, which lacks nucleic acids, resists proteolytic digestion, and spontaneously aggregates in the brain. Most cases are sporadic; 5% to 15% are familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Although CJD isn't transmitted by normal casual contact, human-to-human transmission can occur as a result of certain medical procedures, such as corneal and cadaveric dura mater grafts. Isolated cases have resulted\\nfrom childhood treatment with harvested human growth hormone and from improperly decontaminated neurosurgical instruments and brain electrodes. CJD typically affects adults ages 40 to 65 and occurs in more than 50 countries. Males and females are affected equally. In people younger than age 30, incidence is 5 in 1 billion; in all other age groups, incidence is 1 in 1 million. P Complications Impaired gait Incontinence Akinetic mute state Bronchopneumonia Death Signs and symptoms Early signs and symptoms of mental impairment may include\\nslowness in thinking, difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment, and memory loss. Dementia is progressive and occurs early. Involuntary movements, such as muscle twitching, trembling, and peculiar body movements, and visual disturbances, appear with disease progression and advancing mental deterioration. Hallucinations are also common. Duration\\nof the typical illness is 4 months. Diagnosis CJD must be considered for anyone with signs of progressive dementia. Neurologic examination is the most effective tool in diagnosing CJD. Difficulty with rapid alternating movements and point-to-point movements are typically evident early in the disease. An EEG may be performed to assess the patient for typical\\nchanges in brain wave activity. Computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and lumbar puncture may be useful in ruling out other disorders that cause dementia. Though not diagnostic, presence\\nof the 14-3-3 protein in the spinal fluid is highly suggestive of the disease when it's accompanied by other characteristic symptoms. Definitive diagnosis usually isn't obtained until an autopsy is done and brain tissue is examined. Treatment There's no cure for CJD, and its progress can't be slowed. Palliative care is provided to make the patient comfortable and to ease symptoms. Medications may be needed to control aggressive behaviors. These include sedatives and antipsychotics. The need to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet physiologic needs may require monitoring and assistance in the home or in an institutionalized setting. Family counseling may help in coping with the changes required for home care. Behavior modification may be helpful, in some cases, for controlling unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Reality orientation, with repeated reinforcement of environmental and other cues, may help reduce disorientation. Legal advice may be appropriate early in the course of the disorder regarding advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions that may make it easier to make ethical decisions regarding the care of an individual with CJD. Special considerations Offer emotional support to the patient and\\nhis family. Teach them about the disease, and assist them through the grieving process. Refer the patient and his family to CJD support groups, and encourage participation. Contact social services and hospice, as appropriate, to assist the family with their needs. Encourage the patient and his family to discuss and complete advance directives. To prevent disease transmission, use caution when handling body fluids and other materials from patients suspected of having CJD. Reye's syndrome Reye's syndrome is an acute illness affecting children and, less commonly, adults. It causes fatty infiltration of the liver with concurrent hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and increased intracranial pressure P (ICP). In addition, fatty infiltration of the kidneys, brain, and myocardium may occur. Prognosis depends on the severity of central nervous system depression. Until recently, mortality was as high as 90%. Today, ICP monitoring and, consequently, early treatment of increased ICP, along with other treatment measures, have cut mortality to about 20%. Death is usually a result of cerebral edema or respiratory arrest. Comatose patients who survive may have residual brain damage. Causes and incidence Reye's syndrome typically begins within 1 to 3 days of an\\nacute viral infection, such as an upper respiratory tract infection, type B influenza, or varicella (chickenpox). Incidence commonly rises during influenza outbreaks and may be linked to salicylate use. For this\\nreason, use of aspirin for children younger than age 15 isn't recommended. The Reye's Syndrome Foundation warns against the use of salicylates, even in topical preparations, when a viral illness is suspected. In Reye's syndrome, damaged hepatic mitochondria disrupt the urea cycle, which normally changes ammonia to urea for its excretion\\nfrom the body. This results in hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and an increase in serum short-chain fatty acids, leading to encephalopathy. Simultaneously, fatty infiltration occurs in renal tubular cells, neuronal tissue, and muscle tissue, including the heart. Reye's syndrome affects children from infancy to adolescence and occurs equally in boys and girls. Peak incidence is at age 6. Complication Increased intracranial pressure Signs and symptoms The severity of the child's signs and symptoms varies with the degree of encephalopathy and cerebral edema. In any case, Reye's syndrome develops in five stages. After the initial viral infection, a brief recovery period follows when the child doesn't seem seriously ill. A few days later, he develops intractable vomiting; lethargy; rapidly changing mental status (mild to severe agitation, confusion, irritability, and delirium); rising blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate; and hyperactive reflexes. Reye's syndrome commonly progresses to coma. As coma deepens, seizures develop, followed by decreased tendon reflexes and, usually, respiratory failure. Increased ICP, a serious complication, is now considered the result of an increased cerebral blood volume causing intracranial hypertension. Such swelling may develop as a result of acidosis, increased cerebral metabolic rate, and an impaired autoregulatory mechanism. Diagnosis A history of a recent viral disorder with typical clinical features strongly suggests Reye's syndrome. An increased serum ammonia level, abnormal clotting studies, and hepatic dysfunction confirm it. Testing serum salicylate level rules out aspirin use. Absence of jaundice despite increased liver aminotransferase levels rules out acute hepatic failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Abnormal test results may include: Liver function studies\\u2014aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase elevated to twice normal levels; bilirubin level usually normal Liver biopsy\\u2014fatty droplets uniformly distributed throughout cells Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\\u2014 white blood cell count less than 10/mcl; with coma, increased CSF pressure. Coagulation studies\\u2014prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time prolonged Blood values\\u2014serum ammonia levels elevated; serum glucose levels normal or, in 15% of cases, low; serum fatty acid and lactate levels increased. STAGES OF TREATMENT FOR REYE'S SYNDROME P 6 Signs and symptoms Baseline treatment Baseline intervention Stage I: vomiting, lethargy, hepatic dysfunction \\u25aa\\nTo decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain edema, give I.V. fluids at 2/3 maintenance. Also give an osmotic diuretic or furosemide. \\u25aa To treat hypoprothrombinemia, give vitamin K; if vitamin K is unsuccessful, give fresh frozen plasma. \\u25aa Monitor serum ammonia and blood glucose levels and plasma osmolality every 4 to 8 hours to check progress. \\u25aa\\nMonitor the patient's vital signs and check his level of consciousness for increasing lethargy. Take vital signs more often as the patient's condition deteriorates. \\u25aa Monitor fluid intake and output to prevent fluid overload. Maintain\\nurine output at 1.0 ml/kg/hour; plasma osmolality, 290 mOsm; and blood glucose, 150 mg/ml. ( Goal: Keep glucose level high, osmolality normal to high, and ammonia level low.) Also, restrict protein. Stage II: hyperventilation, delirium, hepatic dysfunction, hyperactive reflexes \\u25aa Continue baseline treatment. \\u25aa Maintain seizure precautions. \\u25aa Immediately report any signs of coma that require invasive, supportive therapy, such as intubation. \\u25aa Keep the head of the bed at a 30- degree angle. Stage III: coma, hyperventilation, decorticate rigidity, hepatic dysfunction \\u25aa Continue baseline and seizure treatment. \\u25aa Monitor ICP with a subarachnoid screw or other invasive device. \\u25aa Provide endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to control the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) levels. A paralyzing agent, such as atracurium or pancuronium \\u25aa\\nMonitor ICP (should be less than 20 mm Hg before suctioning) or give a barbiturate I.V., as ordered; hyperventilate the patient as necessary. \\u25aa When ventilating the patient, maintain PaCO 2 between 25 and 30 mm Hg and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen between 80 and 100 mm Hg. \\u25aa Closely monitor cardiovascular status with a pulmonary artery I.V., may help maintain ventilation. \\u25aa Give mannitol I.V. or glycerol by nasogastric tube. catheter or central venous pressure line. \\u25aa Give skin and mouth care and perform range-of-motion exercises. Stage IV: deepening coma; decerebrate rigidity; large, fixed pupils; minimal hepatic dysfunction \\u25aa Continue baseline and supportive care. \\u25aa If all previous measures fail, some pediatric centers use barbiturate coma, decompressive craniotomy, hypothermia, or exchange transfusion. \\u25aa Check the patient for loss of reflexes and signs of flaccidity. \\u25aa Give the patent's family the extra support they need, considering their child's poor prognosis. Stage V: seizures, loss of deep tendon reflexes, flaccidity, respiratory arrest, ammonia level above 300 mg/dl \\u25aa Continue baseline and supportive care. \\u25aa Help the patient's family to face his impending death. Treatment For treatment guidelines, see Stages of treatment for Reye's syndrome. PREVENTION Advise parents to give nonsalicylate\\nanalgesics and antipyretics such as acetaminophen. For more information, refer parents to the National Reye's Syndrome Foundation. Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome is an acute, rapidly progressive,\\nand potentially fatal form of polyneuritis that causes muscle weakness and mild distal sensory loss. Recovery is spontaneous and complete in about 95% of P patients, although mild motor or reflex deficits in the feet and legs may persist. The prognosis is best when symptoms clear between 15 and 20 days after onset. Causes and incidence Precisely what causes Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome is unknown,\\nbut it may be a cell-mediated immunologic attack on peripheral nerves in response to a virus. The major pathologic effect is segmental demyelination of the peripheral nerves. Because this syndrome causes inflammation and degenerative changes in both the posterior (sensory) and anterior (motor) nerve roots, signs of sensory and motor losses occur simultaneously. This syndrome (also called infectious polyneuritis, Landry-Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome, and acute idiopathic polyneuritis) can occur at any age but is most common between ages 30 and 50; it affects both sexes equally. In the United States, it has an incidence of 0.6 to 2.4 cases per 100,000 people. Complications Thrombophlebitis Pressure ulcers Contractures Muscle wasting Aspiration Respiratory tract infections Respiratory and cardiac compromise Signs and symptoms About 50% of patients with Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome have a\\nhistory of minor febrile illness (10 to 14 days before onset), usually an upper respiratory tract infection or, less commonly, gastroenteritis with Camphylobacter jejuni . When infection precedes onset of Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 P syndrome, signs of infection subside before neurologic features appear. Other possible precipitating factors include surgery, rabies or swine influenza vaccination, viral illness like Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and HIV, Hodgkin's or other malignant disease, and lupus erythematosus. Symmetrical muscle weakness, the major neurologic sign, usually appears in the legs first (ascending type) and then extends to the arms and facial nerves in 24 to 72 hours. Sometimes, muscle weakness develops in the arms first (descending type) or in the arms and legs simultaneously. (See Testing for thoracic sensation .) In milder forms of this disease, muscle weakness may affect only the cranial nerves or may not occur at all. Another common neurologic sign is paresthesia, which sometimes precedes muscle weakness but tends to vanish quickly. However,\\nsome patients with this disorder never develop this symptom. Other clinical features may include\\nfacial diplegia (possibly with ophthalmoplegia), dysphagia or dysarthria and, less commonly, weakness of the muscles supplied by cranial nerve XI. Muscle weakness develops so quickly that muscle atrophy doesn't occur, but hypotonia and areflexia do. Stiffness and pain in the form of a severe \\u201ccharley horse\\u201d commonly occur. TESTING FOR THORACIC SENSATION When Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome progresses rapidly, test for\\nascending sensory loss by touching the patient or pressing his skin lightly with a pin every hour. Move systematically from the iliac crest (T12) to the scapula, occasionally substituting the blunt end of the pin\\nto test the patient's ability to discriminate between sharp and dull. Mark the level of diminished sensation to measure any change. If diminished sensation ascends to T8 or higher, the patient's intercostal muscle function (and consequently respiratory function) will\\nprobably be impaired. As Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome subsides, sensory and motor weakness descends to the lower thoracic segments, heralding a return of intercostal and extremity muscle function. SEGMENTAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPINAL NERVES TO BACK OF THE BODY Key: T = thoracic segments The clinical course of Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome is divided\\ninto three phases. The initial phase begins when the first definitive symptom appears and ends 1 to 3 weeks later, when no further deterioration manifests. The plateau phase lasts several days to 2 weeks\\nand is followed by the recovery phase, which is believed to coincide with remyelination and axonal process regrowth. The recovery phase extends over a period of 4 to 6 months; patients with severe disease may\\ntake up to 2 years to recover, and recovery may not be complete. Diagnosis A history of febrile illness (usually a respiratory tract\\ninfection) and typical clinical features suggest Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome. Several days after onset of signs and symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels begin to rise, peaking in 4 to 6\\nweeks, probably as a result of widespread inflammatory disease of the nerve roots. CSF white blood cell count remains normal, but in severe disease CSF pressure may rise above normal. Probably because of predisposing infection, CBC shows leukocytosis and a shift to immature forms early in the illness, but blood studies soon return to normal. Electromyography may show repeated firing of the same motor unit instead\\nof widespread sectional stimulation. Nerve conduction velocities are slowed soon after paralysis develops and show demyelination. Diagnosis must rule out similar diseases such as acute poliomyelitis. Treatment Treatment is primarily supportive, including such measures as endotracheal (ET) intubation or tracheotomy if the patient has difficulty clearing secretions. Preventing complications is another goal of treatment. Plasmapheresis is useful in decreasing severity of symptoms, thereby facilitating a more rapid recovery. I.V. immune globulin is equally effective in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms. Special considerations Monitoring the patient for escalation of symptoms is of special concern. Watch for ascending sensory loss, which precedes motor loss. Also, monitor vital signs and level of consciousness. Assess and treat respiratory dysfunction. If respiratory muscles are weak, take serial vital capacity recordings. Use a respirometer with a mouthpiece or a facemask for bedside testing. Obtain arterial blood gas measurements. Because neuromuscular disease results in primary hypoventilation with hypoxemia and hypercapnia, watch for respiratory failure. Be alert for signs of rising partial pressure of carbon dioxide (such as confusion and tachypnea). P Auscultate breath sounds, turn and position the patient, and encourage coughing and deep breathing. Begin respiratory support at the first sign of dyspnea or with decreasing partial pressure of arterial oxygen. If respiratory failure becomes imminent, establish an emergency airway with an ET tube. Give meticulous skin care to prevent skin breakdown and contractures. Establish a strict turning schedule; inspect\\nthe skin (especially sacrum, heels, and ankles) for breakdown, and reposition the patient every 2 hours. After each position change, stimulate circulation by carefully massaging pressure points. Also, use foam, gel, or alternating pressure pads at points of contact. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises within the patient's pain limits. When the patient's condition stabilizes, change to gentle stretching and active assistance exercises. To prevent aspiration, test the gag reflex, and elevate the head of the bed before giving the patient anything to eat. If the gag reflex is absent, give nasogastric feedings until this reflex returns. If the patient has severe paralysis and is expected to have a long recovery period, a gastrostomy tube may be necessary to provide adequate nourishment. As the patient regains strength and can tolerate a vertical position, be alert for postural hypotension. Monitor\\nblood pressure and pulse during tilting periods and, if necessary, apply toe-to-groin elastic bandages to prevent postural hypotension. Inspect the patient's legs regularly for signs of thrombophlebitis (localized pain, tenderness, erythema, edema, and positive Homans' sign), a common complication of Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome. To prevent thrombophlebitis, apply antiembolism stockings and give prophylactic anticoagulants, as ordered. If the patient has facial paralysis, give eye and mouth care every 4 hours. Watch for urine retention. Measure and record intake and output every 8 hours, and offer the bedpan every 3 to 4\\nhours. Encourage adequate fluid intake of 2 qt (about 2 L) per day, unless contraindicated. If urine retention develops, begin intermittent catheterization as ordered. Because the abdominal muscles are weak, the patient may need manual pressure on the bladder (Cred\\u00e9 method) before he\\ncan urinate. To prevent or relieve constipation, offer the patient plenty of water, prune juice, and a high-bulk diet. If necessary, give daily or alternate- day suppositories (glycerin or bisacodyl) or enemas, as ordered. Before discharge, prepare a home care plan. Teach the patient how to transfer from bed to wheelchair, from wheelchair to toilet or tub, and how to walk short distances with a walker or a cane. Teach the family how to help him eat, compensating for\\nfacial weakness, and how to help him avoid skin breakdown. Stress the need for a regular bowel and bladder routine. Refer the patient for physical therapy as needed. Refer the patient's family to the Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 Syndrome Foundation International. NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis produces sporadic but progressive weakness and abnormal fatigability of striated (skeletal) muscles, exacerbated by exercise and repeated movement, but improved by anticholinesterase drugs. Usually, this disorder affects muscles innervated by the cranial nerves (face, lips, tongue, neck, and throat),\\nbut it can affect any muscle group. Myasthenia gravis follows an unpredictable course of recurring exacerbations and periodic remissions.\\nThere's no known cure. Drug treatment has improved prognosis and allows\\npatients to lead relatively normal lives except during exacerbations. When the disease involves the respiratory system, it may be life threatening. Causes and incidence Myasthenia gravis causes a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction. Theoretically, such impairment may result from an autoimmune response, ineffective acetylcholine release, or P inadequate muscle fiber response to acetylcholine. (See Impaired transmission in myasthenia gravis , page 220.) Myasthenia gravis affects 3 of every 10,000 people at any\\nage, but it's more common in young women and older men. About 20% of neonates born to mothers with myasthenia gravis have transient (or occasionally persistent) myasthenia. This disease may coexist with immunologic and thyroid disorders; about 15% of patients with myasthenia\\ngravis have thymomas. Remissions occur in about 25% of patients. Complications Respiratory distress Pneumonia Chewing and swallowing difficulties Aspiration Signs and symptoms The dominant symptoms of myasthenia gravis are skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. In the early stages, easy fatigability of certain muscles may appear with no other findings. Later, it may be severe enough to cause paralysis. Typically, myasthenic muscles are strongest in the morning but weaken throughout the day, especially after exercise. Short rest periods temporarily restore muscle function. Muscle weakness is progressive; more and more muscles become weak, and eventually some muscles may lose function entirely. Resulting symptoms depend on the muscle group affected; they become more intense during menses and after emotional stress, prolonged exposure to sunlight or cold, or infections. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IMPAIRED TRANSMISSION IN MYASTHENIA GRAVIS Onset may be sudden or insidious. In many patients, weak eye closure, ptosis, and diplopia are the first signs that something is wrong. Patients with myasthenia gravis usually have blank, expressionless faces and nasal vocal tones. They experience frequent nasal regurgitation of fluids and have difficulty chewing and swallowing. Because of this, they usually worry about choking. Their eyelids droop (ptosis), and they may have to tilt their heads back to see. Their neck muscles may become too weak to support their heads without bobbing. In patients with weakened respiratory muscles, decreased tidal volume and vital capacity make breathing difficult and predispose to pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections. Respiratory muscle weakness (myasthenic crisis) may be severe enough to require an emergency airway and mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis P Repeated muscle use over a very short time that fatigues and then improves with rest suggests a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Tests for this neurologic condition record the effect of exercise and subsequent rest on muscle weakness. Electromyography, with repeated neural stimulation, may help confirm this diagnosis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies may be present in the blood. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The classic proof of myasthenia gravis is improved muscle function after an I.V. injection of edrophonium or neostigmine (anticholinesterase drugs ). In patients with myasthenia gravis, muscle function improves within 30 to 60 seconds and lasts up to 30 minutes. Longstanding ocular muscle dysfunction may fail to respond to such testing. This test can differentiate a myasthenic crisis from a cholinergic crisis (caused by acetylcholine overactivity at the neuromuscular junction). The acetylcholine receptor antibody titer may be elevated in generalized myasthenia. Evaluation should rule out thyroid disease and thymoma. Treatment Treatment is symptomatic. Anticholinesterase drugs, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine, counteract fatigue and muscle weakness and allow about 80% of normal muscle function. However, these drugs become less effective as the disease worsens. Corticosteroids may relieve symptoms. Immunosuppressants are also used. Plasmapheresis is used in severe myasthenic exacerbation. Patients with thymomas require thymectomy, which may cause remission in some cases of adult-onset myasthenia. Acute exacerbations that cause severe respiratory distress necessitate emergency treatment. Tracheotomy, positive-pressure ventilation, and vigorous suctioning to remove secretions usually produce improvement in a\\nfew days. Because anticholinesterase drugs aren't effective in myasthenic crisis, they're stopped until respiratory function improves. Myasthenic crisis requires immediate hospitalization and vigorous respiratory support. Special considerations Careful baseline assessment, early recognition and treatment of potential crises, supportive measures, and thorough patient\\nteaching can minimize exacerbations and complications. Continuity of care is essential. Establish an accurate neurologic and respiratory baseline. Thereafter, monitor tidal volume and vital capacity regularly. The patient may need a ventilator and frequent suctioning to remove accumulating secretions. Be alert for signs of an impending crisis (increased muscle weakness, respiratory distress, and difficulty in talking or chewing). To prevent relapses, adhere closely to the\\nordered drug administration schedule. Be prepared to give atropine for anticholinesterase overdose or toxicity. Plan exercise, meals, patient care, and activities to make the most of energy peaks. For example, give medication 20 to 30 minutes before meals to facilitate chewing or swallowing. Allow the patient to participate in his care. When swallowing is difficult, give soft, solid foods instead of liquids to lessen the risk of choking. Patient teaching is essential because myasthenia gravis is usually a lifelong condition. Help the patient plan\\ndaily activities to coincide with energy peaks. Stress the need for frequent rest periods throughout the day. Emphasize that periodic remissions, exacerbations, and day-to-day fluctuations are common. Teach the patient how to recognize adverse\\neffects and signs of toxicity of anticholinesterase drugs (headaches, weakness, sweating, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive salivation, and bronchospasm) and corticosteroids (euphoria, insomnia, edema, and increased appetite). Warn the patient to avoid strenuous exercise, stress, infection, and needless exposure to the sun or cold. All of these things may worsen signs and symptoms. P For more information and an opportunity to\\nmeet other myasthenia gravis patients who lead full, productive lives, refer the patient to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's disease, is the most common of the motor neuron diseases that cause muscle atrophy. (See Motor neuron disease .)\\nOther motor neuron diseases include progressive muscular atrophy and progressive bulbar palsy. Symptoms don't develop until age 50. A chronic, progressively debilitating disease, ALS may be fatal in less than 1 year or continue for 10 years or more, depending on the muscles it affects. Causes and incidence ALS affects about 1 of 100,000 people. The exact cause of\\nALS is unknown, but about 10% of cases have a genetic component. In these patients, it's an autosomal dominant trait and affects men and women equally. Other than a family member affected with the hereditary form, there are no known risk factors. Complications Pneumonia Aspiration Pressure ulcers Contractures MOTOR NEURON DISEASE In its final stages, motor neuron disease affects both upper and lower motor neuron cells. However, the site of initial cell damage varies according to the specific disease: progressive bulbar palsy: degeneration of upper motor neurons in the medulla oblongata progressive muscular atrophy: degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: degeneration of upper motor neurons in the medulla oblongata and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. Signs and symptoms Progressive loss of muscle strength and coordination eventually interfere with everyday activities. Patients with ALS develop\\nfasciculations, accompanied by atrophy and weakness, especially in the muscles of the feet and the hands. Other signs include impaired speech; difficulty chewing, swallowing, and breathing and, occasionally, choking\\nand excessive drooling. Mental deterioration doesn't occur, but patients may become depressed as a reaction to the disease. Diagnosis Characteristic clinical features indicate a combination of upper and lower motor neuron involvement without sensory impairment. Electromyography and muscle biopsy indicate that the motor nerves aren't\\nfunctioning, yet sensory nerves are normal. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging may help rule out other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord neoplasm, central nervous system syphilis, polyarteritis, syringomyelia, myasthenia gravis, progressive muscular dystrophy, and progressive strokes. Treatment Management aims to control symptoms and provide emotional, psychological, and physical support. Riluzole may increase quality of life and survival but doesn't reverse or stop disease progression. Baclofen or diazepam help control spasticity that interferes with activities of daily living. Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline may be used for impaired ability to swallow saliva. Gastrostomy may be needed early P to prevent choking; referral to an otolaryngologist is advised. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, and use of appliances or orthopedic intervention may be required to maximize function. Devices to assist in breathing at night or mechanical ventilation should be discussed, but the patient's wishes should be respected. Special considerations Because mental status remains intact while progressive physical degeneration takes place, the patient acutely perceives every change. This threatens the patient's relationships, career, income, muscle coordination, sexuality, and energy. Implement a rehabilitation program designed to maintain independence as long as possible. Help the patient obtain assistive equipment, such as a walker and a wheelchair. Arrange for a visiting nurse to oversee the patient's status, to provide support, and to teach the family about the illness. Depending on the patient's muscular capacity, assist with bathing, personal hygiene, and transfers from wheelchair to bed. Help establish a regular bowel and bladder routine. To help the patient handle increased accumulation of secretions and dysphagia, teach him to suction himself. He should have a suction machine handy at home to reduce the fear of choking. To prevent skin breakdown, provide good skin care when the patient is bedridden. Turn him often, keep his skin clean and dry, and use pressure-reducing devices such as alternating air\\nmattress. If the patient has trouble swallowing, give him soft, solid foods and position him upright during meals. Gastrostomy and nasogastric tube feedings may be necessary if he can no longer swallow. Teach the patient (if he's still able to feed himself) or his family how to administer gastrostomy feedings. Provide emotional support. A discussion of\\ndirectives regarding health care decisions should be instituted before the patient becomes unable to communicate his wishes. Prepare the patient and his family members for his eventual death, and encourage the\\nstart of the grieving process. Patients with ALS may benefit from a hospice program or the local ALS support group chapter. Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease caused by demyelination of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. (See Demyelination in multiple sclerosis .)\\nIn this disease, sporadic patches of demyelination throughout the central nervous system induce widely disseminated and varied neurologic dysfunction. Characterized by exacerbations and remissions, MS is a major cause of chronic disability in young adults. DEMYELINATION IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Transverse section of cervical spine shows partial loss of myelin, characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS). This degenerative process is called demyelination . In this illustration, the loss of myelin is nearly complete. Clinical features of MS depend on the extent of demyelination. P The prognosis varies; MS may progress rapidly, disabling some patients by early adulthood or causing death within months of onset. However, 70% of patients lead active, productive lives with prolonged remissions. Causes and incidence The exact cause of MS is unknown, but current theories suggest a slow- acting or latent viral infection and an autoimmune response. Other theories suggest that environmental and genetic factors may also be linked to MS. Emotional stress, overwork, fatigue, pregnancy, and acute respiratory tract infections have been known to precede the onset of this illness. MS usually begins between ages 20 and 40. It affects more\\nwomen than men. A family history of MS and living in a geographical area with higher incidence of MS (northern Europe, northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand) increase the risk. Complications Injuries from falls Urinary tract infections Constipation Joint contractures Pressure ulcers Rectal distention Pneumonia Signs and symptoms Clinical findings in MS depend on the extent and site of myelin destruction, the extent of remyelination, and the adequacy of subsequent restored synaptic transmission. Signs and symptoms in MS may be transient, or they may last for hours or weeks. They may wax and wane with no predictable pattern, vary from day to day, and be bizarre and difficult for the patient to describe. In most patients, visual problems and sensory impairment,\\nsuch as numbness and tingling sensations (paresthesia), are the first signs that something may be wrong. Other characteristic changes include: ocular disturbances\\u2014 optic neuritis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, blurred vision, and nystagmus muscle dysfunction\\u2014 weakness, paralysis ranging from monoplegia to quadriplegia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, intention tremor, and gait ataxia urinary disturbances\\u2014 incontinence, frequency, urgency, and frequent infections emotional lability\\u2014 characteristic mood swings, irritability, euphoria, and depression. Associated signs and symptoms include poorly articulated or scanning speech and dysphagia. Clinical effects may be so mild that the patient is unaware of them or so bizarre that he appears hysterical. Diagnosis A misdiagnosis of psychiatric problems is common. Because\\nearly symptoms may be mild, years may elapse between onset of the first signs and the diagnosis, which typically requires evidence of multiple neurologic attacks and characteristic remissions and exacerbations. Magnetic resonance imaging may detect MS lesions; however, diagnosis P still remains difficult. Periodic testing and close observation of the patient are necessary, perhaps for years, depending on the course of the disease. Abnormal EEG findings occur in one-third of patients. Lumbar puncture shows elevated gamma globulin fraction of immunoglobulin\\nG but normal total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels. Elevated CSF gamma globulin is significant only when serum gamma globulin levels are normal because it reflects hyperactivity of the immune system due to\\nchronic demyelination. Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulin can be detected when gamma globulin in CSF is examined by electrophoresis, and these bands are present in most patients, even when the percentage of gamma globulin in CSF is normal. In addition, the white blood cell count in CSF may rise. Differential diagnosis must rule out spinal cord compression, foramen magnum tumor (may mimic the exacerbations and remissions of MS), multiple small strokes, syphilis or other infection, and psychological disturbances. Treatment The aim of treatment is to shorten exacerbations and relieve neurologic deficits so that the patient can resume a normal lifestyle. Those with relapsing-remitting courses are placed on immune modulating therapy, with interferon or glatiramer acetate. Steroids are used to reduce the associated edema of the myelin sheath during exacerbations. Other drugs include baclofen, tizanidine, or diazepam to relieve spasticity, cholinergic agents to relieve urine retention and minimize frequency and urgency, amantadine to relieve fatigue, and antidepressants to help with mood or behavioral symptoms. During acute exacerbations, supportive measures include bed rest, comfort measures such as massages, prevention of fatigue, prevention of pressure ulcers, bowel and bladder training (if necessary), administration of antibiotics for bladder infections, physical therapy, and counseling. Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and support groups are also useful. Planned exercise programs help with maintaining muscle tone. Special considerations Management considerations focus on educating the patient and his family. Assist with physical therapy. Increase patient comfort with massages and relaxing baths. Assist with active, resistive, and stretching exercises to maintain muscle tone and joint mobility, decrease spasticity, improve coordination, and boost morale. Educate the patient and his family concerning the chronic course of MS. Emphasize the need to avoid temperature extremes, stress, fatigue, and infections and other illnesses, all of which can trigger an MS attack. Advise him to maintain\\nindependence by developing new ways of performing daily activities. Stress the importance of eating a nutritious, well-balanced diet that contains sufficient roughage and adequate fluids to prevent constipation. Evaluate the need for bowel and bladder training during hospitalization. Encourage adequate fluid intake and regular urination. Eventually, the patient may require urinary drainage by self-catheterization or, in men, condom drainage. Teach the correct use of suppositories to help establish a regular bowel schedule. Promote emotional stability. Help the patient establish a daily routine to maintain optimal functioning. Activity level is regulated by tolerance level. Encourage regular rest periods to prevent fatigue and daily physical exercise. Inform the patient that exacerbations are unpredictable, necessitating physical and emotional adjustments in lifestyle. For more information, refer him to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. CRANIAL NERVE DISORDERS Trigeminal neuralgia P Trigeminal neuralgia, also called tic douloureux, is a painful disorder of one or more branches of the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve that produces paroxysmal attacks of excruciating facial pain precipitated by stimulation of a trigger zone. It can subside spontaneously, and remissions may last from several months to years. Causes and incidence Although the cause remains undetermined, trigeminal neuralgia may reflect an afferent reflex in the brain stem or in the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve. Such neuralgia may also be related\\nto compression of the nerve root by posterior fossa tumors, middle fossa tumors, or vascular lesions (subclinical aneurysm), although such lesions usually produce simultaneous loss of sensation. Occasionally, trigeminal neuralgia is a manifestation of multiple sclerosis or herpes zoster. Whatever the cause, the pain of trigeminal neuralgia is probably produced by an interaction or shortcircuiting of touch and pain fibers. Trigeminal neuralgia occurs mostly in people older than age 40, in women more commonly than men, and on the right side of the face more commonly than the left. Incidence is 4 to 5 cases per 100,000 people. Signs and symptoms Typically, the patient reports a searing or burning pain that occurs in lightninglike jabs and lasts from 1 to 15 minutes (usually 1 to 2 minutes) in an area innervated by one of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve, primarily the superior mandibular or maxillary division. The pain rarely affects more than one division and seldom the first division (ophthalmic) or both sides of the face. It affects the second (maxillary) and third (mandibular) divisions of the trigeminal nerve equally. (See Trigeminal nerve function and distribution. ) TRIGEMINAL NERVE FUNCTION AND DISTRIBUTION Function Motor: chewing movements Sensory: sensations of face, scalp, and teeth (mouth and nasal chamber) Distribution I Ophthalmic II Maxillary III Mandibular These attacks characteristically follow stimulation of a trigger zone, usually by a light touch to a hypersensitive area, such as\\nthe tip of the nose, the cheeks, or the gums. Although attacks can occur at any time, they may follow a draft of air, exposure to heat or cold, eating, smiling, talking, or drinking hot or cold beverages. The frequency of attacks varies greatly, from many times a day to several times a month or year. Between attacks, most patients are free from pain, although some have a constant, dull ache. No patient is ever free from the fear of the next attack. Diagnosis The patient's pain history is the basis for diagnosis because trigeminal neuralgia produces no objective clinical or pathologic changes. Physical examination shows no impairment of sensory or motor function; indeed, P sensory impairment implies a space-occupying lesion as the cause of pain. Observation during the examination shows the patient favoring (splinting) the affected area. To ward off a painful attack, the patient commonly holds his face immobile when talking. He may also leave the affected side of his face unwashed and unshaven or protect it with a coat or shawl. When asked where the pain occurs, he points to\\u2014but never touches\\u2014the affected area. Witnessing a typical attack helps to confirm diagnosis. Rarely, a tumor in the posterior fossa can produce pain that's clinically indistinguishable from trigeminal neuralgia. Skull X- rays, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging rule out sinus or tooth infections and tumors. If the patient has trigeminal neuralgia, these test results are normal. Treatment Oral administration of carbamazepine (Tegretol), gabapentin (Neurontin), or phenytoin may temporarily relieve or prevent pain. Opioids are of little help during the pain episode. Caution should\\nbe used when treating a chronic problem with opioids. When these medical measures fail or attacks become increasingly frequent or severe, neurosurgical procedures may provide permanent relief. The preferred procedure is percutaneous electrocoagulation of nerve rootlets under local anesthetic. New treatments include a percutaneous radio frequency procedure, which causes partial root destruction and relieves pain, and microsurgery for vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve. Special considerations The focus here is management of pain. Observe and record the characteristics of each attack, including the patient's protective mechanisms. Provide adequate nutrition in small, frequent meals served at room temperature. Avoid jarring the bed and causing increased discomfort. If the patient is receiving neuroleptics, watch for cutaneous and hematologic reactions (erythematous and pruritic\\nrashes, urticaria, photosensitivity, exfoliative dermatitis, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and, possibly, urine retention and transient drowsiness. For the first 3 months of therapy, monitor complete blood count and liver function weekly, then monthly thereafter. Warn the patient to immediately report fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, easy bruising, or petechial or purpuric hemorrhage because these may signal thrombocytopenia or aplastic anemia and may require discontinuation of drug therapy. If the patient is receiving phenytoin, also watch for adverse effects, including ataxia, skin eruptions, gingival hyperplasia, and nystagmus. After resection of the first branch of the\\ntrigeminal nerve, tell the patient to avoid rubbing his eyes and using aerosol spray. Advise him to wear glasses or goggles outdoors and to blink often. After surgery to sever the second or third\\nbranch, tell the patient to avoid hot foods and drinks, which could burn his mouth, and to chew carefully to avoid biting his mouth. The patient may need to eat pureed food, possibly through a straw. Advise him to place food in the unaffected side of his mouth when chewing, to brush his teeth and rinse his mouth often, and to see the dentist twice a\\nyear to detect cavities because he won't experience pain from cavities in the area of the severed nerve. After surgical decompression of the root or partial nerve dissection, check neurologic and vital signs often. Provide emotional support, and encourage the patient to express his feelings. Promote independence through self-care and maximum physical activity. Reinforce natural avoidance of stimulation (air, heat, and cold) of trigger zones (lips, cheeks, and gums). Bell's palsy Bell's palsy is a disease of the seventh cranial nerve (facial) that produces unilateral or bilateral facial weakness or paralysis. (See Recognizing unilateral Bell's palsy , page 228.)\\nOnset is rapid. In 80% to 90% of patients, Bell's palsy subsides spontaneously, with complete P recovery in 1 to 8 weeks; however, recovery\\nmay be delayed in the elderly. If recovery is partial, contractures may\\ndevelop on the paralyzed side of the face. Bell's palsy may recur on the same or opposite side of the face. Causes and incidence Bell's palsy blocks the seventh cranial nerve, which is responsible for motor innervation of the muscles of the face. The conduction block is from an inflammatory reaction around the nerve (usually at the internal auditory meatus), which may result from infection, hemorrhage, tumor, meningitis, local trauma, hypertension, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or infarction of the nerve. Bell's palsy affects all age groups and males and females\\nnearly equally, although females are slightly more likely to develop it\\nduring their late teens and early 20s. In the United States, incidence is 23 cases per 100,000 people. Complications Corneal ulcers Blindness Impaired nutrition Signs and symptoms Bell's palsy usually produces unilateral facial weakness, occasionally with aching pain around the angle of the jaw or behind the ear. On the weak side, the mouth droops (causing the patient to drool saliva from the corner of his mouth), and taste perception is distorted over the affected anterior portion of the tongue. The forehead appears smooth, and the patient's ability to close his eye on the weak side is markedly impaired. When he tries to close this eye, it rolls upward (Bell's phenomenon) and shows excessive tearing. Although Bell's phenomenon occurs in normal people, it isn't apparent because the eyelids close completely and cover this eye motion. In Bell's palsy, incomplete eye closure makes this upward motion obvious. Other symptoms may include loss of taste and ringing in the ear. RECOGNIZING UNILATERAL BELL'S PALSY Bell's palsy usually causes a unilateral facial paralysis. This produces a distorted appearance with an inability to wrinkle the forehead, close the eyelid, smile, show the teeth, or puff out the cheek. P Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation: distorted facial appearance and the inability to raise the eyebrow, close the eyelid, smile, show the teeth, or puff out the cheek. Electromyography helps determine the severity of nerve damage. Blood tests may be done to rule out acute causes (sarcoidosis or Lyme disease). If no improvement is evident within several weeks of onset, magnetic resonance imaging will rule out other causes of dysfunction. Treatment Treatment consists of corticosteroids to reduce facial nerve edema and improve nerve conduction and blood flow. They must be given early\\u2014 within 24 hours of onset of paralysis\\u2014to be most effective. Lubricants or an eye ointment may be needed to protect the eye, as well as patching during sleep. Special considerations Patient care includes observation for adverse drug effects, pain relief, and emotional support. During treatment with corticosteroids, watch for adverse effects, such as GI distress and fluid retention. If GI distress is troublesome, a concomitant antacid usually provides relief. If the patient has diabetes, frequent monitoring of serum glucose levels is necessary. To reduce pain, apply moist heat to the affected side of the face, taking care not to burn the skin. To help maintain muscle tone, massage the patient's face with a gentle upward motion two to three times daily for 5\\nto 10 minutes, or have him massage his face himself. When he's ready for active exercises, teach him to exercise by grimacing in front of a mirror. Advise the patient to protect his eye by covering it with an eye patch, especially when outdoors. Tell him to keep warm and avoid exposure to dust and wind. When exposure is unavoidable, instruct him to cover his face. Instruct the patient to chew on the unaffected side of his mouth. Provide a soft, nutritionally balanced diet, eliminating hot foods and fluids. Give the patient frequent mouth care, being particularly careful to remove residual food that collects between the cheeks and gums. Offer psychological support. Peripheral neuritis Peripheral neuritis (also called multiple neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, and polyneuritis )\\nis the degeneration of peripheral nerves supplying mainly the distal muscles of the extremities. It results in muscle weakness with sensory loss and atrophy and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. This syndrome is associated with a noninflammatory degeneration of the axon and myelin sheaths, chiefly affecting the distal muscles of the extremities. Because onset is usually insidious, patients may compensate\\nby overusing unaffected muscles. If the cause can be identified and eliminated, the prognosis is good. Causes and incidence Causes of peripheral neuritis include: hereditary disorders (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or Friedreich's ataxia) exposure to toxic compounds (sniffing glue\\nor toxic compounds, nitrous oxide, industrial agents\\u2014especially solvents, and heavy metals, such as lead, arsenic, or mercury) infectious or inflammatory diseases (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, botulism, Colorado tick fever, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leprosy, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diphtheria, syphilis, and Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome) systemic or metabolic disorders (diabetes mellitus, dietary deficiencies [especially B 12 ], excessive use of alcohol, uremia, and cancer) neuropathy secondary to drugs miscellaneous causes (ischemia and prolonged exposure to cold temperature). Peripheral neuropathy is common. Risk factors include diabetes, heavy alcohol use, and exposure to certain drugs and chemicals. Prolonged P pressure on a nerve (such as with a cast, splint, or other device) is also risk factor for developing nerve injury. Although it can occur at any age, incidence is highest in men between ages 30 and 50. Complications Impotence Difficulty breathing Dysphagia Signs and symptoms The clinical effects of peripheral neuritis develop slowly, and the disease usually affects the motor and sensory nerve fibers. Symptoms vary according to which type of nerve is affected (sensory, motor, or autonomic). Neuropathy can affect any one or be a combination of all three types. Sensory changes: Damage to sensory fibers results in changes in sensation, ranging from abnormal sensations, such as burning, nerve pain, or tingling, to numbness or an inability to determine joint position in the area. Sensation changes often begin in the feet and progress toward the center\\nof the body with involvement of other areas as the condition worsens. Motor changes: Damage to the motor fibers interferes with muscle control and can cause\\nweakness, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity. Muscle cramping may be a sign of motor nerve involvement. Other muscle-related symptoms include lack of muscle control, difficulty or inability to move a part of the body (paralysis), muscle atrophy, muscle twitching (fasciculation) or cramping, difficulty breathing or swallowing, falling\\n(from legs buckling or tripping over toes), or lack of dexterity (such as the inability to button a shirt). Autonomic changes: The autonomic nerves control involuntary or semivoluntary functions, such as control of internal organs and blood pressure. Damage to autonomic nerves can cause blurred vision, decreased ability to sweat (anhidrosis), dizziness that occurs when standing up or fainting associated with a fall in blood pressure, heat intolerance with exertion\\n(decreased ability to regulate body temperature), nausea or vomiting after meals, abdominal bloating (swelling), feeling full after eating a small amount (early satiety), diarrhea, constipation, unintentional weight loss (more than 5% of body weight), urinary incontinence, feeling\\nof incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate (urinary hesitancy), and male impotence. Diagnosis Patient history and physical examination delineate characteristic distribution of motor and sensory deficits. Electromyography may show a delayed action potential if this condition impairs motor nerve function. Nerve biopsy and nerve conduction tests can facilitate diagnosis. Treatment Effective treatment of peripheral neuritis consists of supportive measures to relieve pain, adequate bed rest, and physical therapy, vocational therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic interventions to promote independence, as needed. Most importantly, however, the underlying cause must be identified and corrected. For instance, it's essential to identify and remove the toxic agent, correct\\nnutritional and vitamin deficiencies (the patient needs a high-calorie diet rich in vitamins, especially B-complex), and counsel the patient to\\navoid alcohol. Over-the-counter analgesics or prescription pain medications may be needed to control nerve pain. Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, and gabapentin) or tricyclic antidepressants may be used to reduce the stabbing pains that some patients experience. Whenever possible, medication use should be minimized to avoid adverse effects. Fludrocortisone or similar medications may be beneficial in reducing postural hypotension for some patients. Medications that increase gastric motility, such as metoclopramide, are helpful for patients with reduced gastric motility. P For patients with bladder dysfunction, manual expression of urine (pressing over the bladder with the hands), intermittent catheterization, or medications such as bethanechol may be necessary. Special considerations Patient care includes promoting maximal independence and control of symptoms. Exercises and retraining may be used to increase muscle strength and control. Appliances, such as wheelchairs, braces, and splints, may improve mobility or the ability to use an affected extremity. The patient with decreased sensation should be taught to check his feet or other affected areas frequently for bruises, open skin areas, or other injuries. A podiatrist can usually determine whether special orthotic devices are needed. Discuss safety measures in the home. Safety measures for the patient experiencing difficulty with movement may include railings, specialized appliances, removal of obstacles (such\\nas loose rugs that may slip on the floor), and other measures, as appropriate. Safety measures for the patient with diminished sensation include adequate lighting (including lights left on at night), testing water temperature before bathing or immersing the body in water, and the\\nuse of protective shoes (no open toes and no high heels). Shoes should be checked often for grit or rough spots that may cause injury to the feet. The patient with neuropathy (especially the patient with polyneuropathy or mononeuropathy multiplex) is prone to\\nnew nerve injury at pressure points, such as the knees and elbows. Caution him to avoid prolonged pressure on these areas from leaning on the elbows, crossing the knees, or similar positions. Advise the patient with orthostatic hypotension to use elastic stockings and sleep with his head elevated. Instruct the patient with reduced gastric motility to eat small, frequent meals and sleep with his head elevated. Assist the patient with bladder dysfunction with manual expression of urine and intermittent catheterization, as necessary. To prevent pressure ulcers, assist in turning and repositioning every 2 hours and apply a food cradle. To prevent contractures, provide range- of-motion exercises as well as arrange for the patient to obtain splints, boards, braces, or other orthopedic appliances. Suggest that the patient's family contact the Neuropathy Association for additional information. PAIN DISORDERS Complex regional pain syndrome Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS1) or causalgia (CRPS2), is a chronic pain disorder that results from abnormal healing after an injury\\u2014either minor or major\\u2014to a bone, muscle, or nerve. The development of symptoms is commonly disproportionate to the severity of the injury and seems to result from abnormal functioning of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls\\nthe diameter of blood vessels. One or more limbs and other parts of the\\nbody may be affected. Causes and incidence The exact cause of CRPS is unknown. Impaired communication between the damaged nerves of the sympathetic nervous system and the brain may cause interference with normal signals for sensations, temperature, and blood flow. This leads to problems in the nerves, blood vessels, skin, bones, and muscles. Infection or injury to an arm or leg may initiate CRPS. It can also occur after heart attacks and strokes. However, the condition can sometimes appear without obvious\\ninjury to the affected limb. This condition is more common in people between ages 40 and 60 but has been seen in younger people too. CRPS may\\nalso be seen in postoperative patients and in patients with diseases that can cause chronic pain, such as cancer and arthritis. Annual incidence is unknown because CRPS is often misdiagnosed. However, it has\\nbeen reported in 1% to 2% of patients with various fractures and in 2% to 5% of patients with peripheral nerve injury. P Complications Depression Drug dependence Signs and symptoms Patients usually report severe and constant pain; severe pain is common with CRPS2 in particular. The affected area may have altered blood flow, feeling either warm or cool to the touch, with discoloration, sweating, or swelling. In time, skin, hair, and nail changes may occur along with impaired mobility and muscle wasting, especially if adequate treatment is delayed. Diagnosis There's no laboratory test for CRPS, so the diagnosis is based on the patient's history and clinical findings. A history of injury to an extremity may point to CRPS. Bone X-rays may aid in ruling out other conditions, such as osteomyelitis and stress fractures, which cause similar signs and symptoms. Additional tests may include bone scans, nerve conduction studies, and thermography (a test to show temperature changes and lack of blood supply in the painful area of the affected limb). With early diagnosis, prognosis improves. Treatment Treatment typically includes a combination of therapies such as drug therapy, with an anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, vasodilator, and analgesic used singly or in varying combinations, depending on the patient and the severity of symptoms. Steroids may be given in some patients; others may be given bone loss medications such as Actonel. Physical therapy to the injured area, application of heat and cold, the use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator unit, biofeedback, and psychological support are helpful for some patients. Treatment may also include techniques for interrupting the hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, such as nerve or regional blocks. Surgical sympathectomy\\u2014radical surgery that involves cutting the nerves to destroy the pain\\u2014may be done in severe cases; however, this method is rarely used because other sensation may be destroyed in the process. Special considerations Offer emotional support to the patient and his family. Teach them about the disease. Monitor effects of prescribed medications. In addition to attending physical therapy sessions, the patient may need a home therapy regimen that includes stretching, active and passive exercises, strengthening exercises, compressive stockings or gloves to control edema, and heat or cold pack applications. Consult a pain care specialist to provide additional options for the patient, and help manage discomfort. Because chronic pain can be an emotional burden to the patient and his family, provide information on resources, such as counseling, support groups, stress-reduction methods, meditation, relaxation training, and hypnosis.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction The GI tract, also known as the alimentary canal, is a long, hollow, musculomembranous tube consisting of glands and accessory organs (salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas). (See Reviewing GI anatomy and physiology. See also Histology of the GI tract, page 236.) The GI tract breaks down food\\u2014carbohydrates, fats, and proteins\\u2014into molecules small enough to permeate cell membranes, thus providing cells with the necessary energy to function properly; it prepares food for cellular absorption by altering its physical and chemical composition. (See Primary source of digestive hormones , page 237.)\\nConsequently, a malfunction along the GI tract can produce far-reaching\\nmetabolic effects, eventually threatening life itself. The GI tract is an unsterile system filled with bacteria and other flora; these organisms can cause superinfection from antibiotic therapy or they can infect other systems when a GI organ ruptures. A common indication of GI\\nproblems is referred pain, which makes diagnosis especially difficult. Accurate assessment vital Your assessment of the patient with suspected GI disease must begin with a careful history that includes occupation, family history, and recent travel. The medical history should include previous hospital admissions; surgical procedures (including recent tooth extraction); family history of ulcers, colitis, or cancer; and current medications, whether prescribed, over-the-counter, or herbal remedies, with particular attention to aspirin, steroids, or anticoagulants. In addition, assess for food or drug allergies. Have the patient describe his chief complaint in his own words. Does he have abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn, or rectal bleeding? How long has he had it? What relieves these symptoms or makes them worse? Has he experienced nosebleeds or difficulty in swallowing recently? Has he had recent weight loss or gain? Is he on a special diet? Does he drink alcoholic beverages or smoke? If yes to either, how much and how often? Ask about bowel habits. Does he regularly use laxatives or enemas? If he experiences nausea and vomiting, what does the vomitus look like? Does changing his position relieve nausea? Next, try to define and locate any pain. Ask the patient to describe the pain. Is it dull, sharp, burning, aching, spasmodic, or intermittent? Where is it located? Does it radiate? How long does it last? When does it occur? What triggers it? What relieves it? Visual assessment Observe how the patient looks, and note appropriateness of behavior. Changes in fluid and electrolyte balance, severe infection,\\ndrug toxicity, and hepatic disease may cause abnormal behavior. Your visual examination should check: Skin \\u2014loss of turgor, jaundice, cyanosis, pallor, diaphoresis, petechiae, bruises, edema, and texture (dry or oily) Head \\u2014color of sclerae, sunken eyes, dentures, caries, lesions, tongue (color, swelling, dryness), and breath odor Chest \\u2014shape (asymmetrical, barrel, or sunken) Lungs \\u2014rate, rhythm, and quality of respirations Abdomen \\u2014size and shape (distention, contour, visible masses, and protrusions), abdominal scars or fistulae, excessive skin folds (may indicate wasting), and abnormal respiratory movements (inflammation of diaphragm). Auscultation, palpation, and percussion P Auscultation provides helpful clues to GI abnormalities and should always be performed before palpation and percussion to avoid altering the assessment. For example, absence of bowel sounds over the area to the lower right of the umbilicus may indicate peritonitis. High-pitched sounds that coincide with colicky pain may indicate small bowel obstruction. Less intense, lowpitched rumbling noises may accompany minor irritation. Palpating the abdomen after auscultation helps detect tenderness, muscle guarding, and abdominal masses. Watch for muscle tone (boardlike rigidity points to peritonitis or hemorrhage; transient rigidity suggests severe pain) and tenderness (rebound tenderness may indicate peritoneal inflammation). REVIEWING GI ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The GI tract includes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach (fundus, body, and antrum), small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal). Digestion begins in the mouth through chewing and through\\nthe action of an enzyme secreted in saliva\\u2014 ptyalin (amylase)\\u2014which breaks down starch. Digestion continues in the stomach, where the lining\\nsecretes gastric juice that contains hydrochloric acid and the enzymes pepsin (begins protein digestion), lipase (speeds hydrolysis of emulsified fats) and, in infants, rennin (curdles milk). Through a churning motion, the stomach breaks food into tiny particles, mixes them with gastric juice, and pushes the mass toward the pylorus. The liquid portion (chyme) enters the duodenum in small amounts; any solid material remains in the stomach until it liquefies (usually from 1 to 6 hours). The stomach also produces an intrinsic factor necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Although limited amounts of water, alcohol, and some drugs are absorbed in the stomach, chyme passes unabsorbed into the duodenum. Small intestine's role Most digestion and absorption occur in the small intestine, where the surface area is increased by millions of villi in the mucous membrane lining. For digestion, the small intestine relies on\\na vast array of enzymes produced by the pancreas or by the intestinal lining itself. Pancreatic enzymes include trypsin, which digests protein to amino acids; lipase, which digests fat to fatty acids and glycerol; and amylase, which digests starches to sugars. Intestinal enzymes include erepsin, which digests protein to amino acids; lactase, maltase,\\nand sucrase, which digest complex sugars like glucose, fructose, and galactose; and enterokinase, which activates trypsin. In addition, bile, secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, helps neutralize stomach acid and aids the small intestine to emulsify and absorb fats and fat- soluble vitamins. Final stages By the time ingested material reaches the ileocecal valve (where the small intestine joins the large intestine), all its nutritional value has been absorbed through the villi of the small intestine into the bloodstream. The large intestine, so named because it's larger in diameter than the small intestine, absorbs water from the digestive material before passing it on for elimination. Rectal distention by feces stimulates the defecation reflex, which, when assisted by voluntary sphincter relaxation, permits defecation. Throughout the GI tract, peristalsis (a coordinated, rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle) propels ingested material along; sphincters prevent its reflux. P Percussion helps detect air, fluid, and solid matter in the abdominal region. Diagnostic tests After physical assessment, several tests can identify GI malfunction. A barium or gastrografin swallow is used primarily to examine the esophagus. Gastrografin may be used instead of barium. Like barium, gastrografin facilitates X-ray imaging. However, if\\ngastrografin escapes from the GI tract, it's absorbed by the surrounding tissue, whereas escaped barium isn't absorbed and can cause complications. HISTOLOGY OF THE GI TRACT The GI tract consists of four tissue layers whose structure varies in different organs: Mucous membrane \\u2014innermost layer; secretes gastric juice, protects the tract, and absorbs nutrients Submucosa \\u2014connective tissue that contains the major blood vessels and nerves External muscle coat (muscularis externa) \\u2014double layer of smooth-muscle fibers; inner circular and outer longitudinal layers propel gastric contents downward by peristalsis Fibroserous coat (serosa) \\u2014outermost\\nprotective layer of connective tissue; forms the peritoneum, which is the largest serous membrane of the body. The peritoneum's parietal layer\\ncovers the walls of the abdominal cavity. An extension of the parietal peritoneum, called the mesentery, anchors the small intestine to the abdominal wall. The visceral layer drapes most of the abdominal organs, covering the upper surface of the pelvic organs. In an upper GI series, swallowed barium sulfate travels through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to reveal abnormalities. The barium outlines stomach walls and delineates ulcer craters and defects. A small-bowel series, an extension of the upper GI series, visualizes barium flowing through the small intestine to the ileocecal valve. A barium enema (lower GI series) allows X-ray visualization of the colon. A stool specimen is useful to detect suspected GI bleeding, infection, or malabsorption as well as the presence of parasites. Guaiac test for occult blood, microscopic stool examination for ova and parasites, and tests for fat require several specimens. In esophagogastroduodenoscopy, insertion of a fiber-optic scope allows direct visual inspection of the esophagus,\\nstomach, and duodenum. These structures are examined for varices, tumors, inflammation, hernias, polyps, ulcers, and obstruction. Proctosigmoidoscopy permits inspection of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon; colonoscopy is used for inspection of the descending, transverse, and ascending colon. These tests help visualize tumors, polyps, hemorrhoids, or ulcers. Gastric analysis examines gastric secretions for the presence of high levels of gastrin and the amount of acid produced. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography directly visualizes the esophagus, stomach, proximal duodenum, and fluoroscopic visualization of the pancreatic, hepatic, and biliary ducts. This test can help visualize duct obstruction, benign structures, cysts, anatomic variations, and malignant tumors. Intubation Certain GI disorders require nasogastric (NG) intubation to empty the stomach and intestine, to aid diagnosis and treatment, to decompress obstructed areas, to detect and treat GI bleeding, and to administer medications or feedings. Tubes generally inserted through the\\nnose are the short NG tubes (the Levin, the Salem Sump, and the specialized P Sengstaken-Blakemore) and the long intestinal tubes (Cantor and Miller- Abbott). The larger Ewald tube is usually inserted orally. When caring for the patient with a tube: Explain the procedure before intubation. Maintain accurate intake and output records. Measure gastric drainage every 8 hours; record the amount, color, odor, and consistency. When irrigating the tube, note the amount of saline solution instilled and aspirated. Check for fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Provide good oral and nasal care. Brush the patient's teeth frequently and provide mouthwash. Make sure that the\\ntube is secure, but isn't causing pressure on the nostrils. Change the tape to the nose every 24 hours. Gently wash the area around the tube, and apply a water- soluble lubricant to soften crusts. These measures help prevent sore throat and nose, dry lips, nasal excoriation, and parotitis. PRIMARY SOURCE OF DIGESTIVE HORMONES Pyloric mucosa Gastrin, which originates in the G cells of the pyloric antral mucosa, stimulates secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells and pepsinogen by chief cells. Duodenal mucosa Secretin, which originates in the duodenal mucosa, stimulates the pancreas to secrete alkaline fluid (water and bicarbonate) into the duodenum, which neutralizes acid from the stomach. Cholecystokinin-pancreozymin, which originates in the duodenal mucosa, stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and contraction and evacuation of the gallbladder. Motilin, which originates in the duodenal mucosa, slows gastric emptying and stimulates gastric acid and pepsin secretion by controlling the pattern of smooth-muscle contractions Jejunal mucosa Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which originates in the jejunal mucosa (also in the duodenal mucosa), stimulates secretion of intestinal juice and insulin and inhibits gastric acid secretion and motility. Other digestive hormones P Three other digestive hormonelike substances are thought to originate in the hypothalamus, GI tract, and neurons of the brain. These substances include substance P, which increases small bowel motility; bombesin, which increases gastrin secretion and small bowel motility; and somatostatin, which inhibits secretion of gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, GIP, secretin, and motilin. Other possible digestive hormones include enterogastrone, enteroglucagon, and somatostatin. More research is needed to confirm and clarify the existence and function of these hormones. Ensure maximum patient comfort. After insertion of a long intestinal tube, instruct the patient to turn from side to side to facilitate its passage through the GI tract. Note the tube's progress. Never attach an intestinal tube to a patient's gown, bed linens, side rails of the bed, and so forth. With both types of tubes, tell the patient\\nto expect a feeling of dryness or a lump in the throat; if he's allowed, suggest that he chew gum or eat hard candy to relieve discomfort. Always keep scissors taped to the wall near the bed when the patient has a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube in place. If the tube should dislodge and obstruct the bronchus, cut the lumen to the balloons immediately. Sometimes the tube is taped to the face piece of a football helmet worn by the patient to prevent the tube from dislodging and to put traction on the tube. After removing the tube from a patient with GI bleeding, watch for signs and symptoms of recurrent bleeding, such as hematemesis, decreased hemoglobin level, pallor, chills, diaphoresis, hypotension, and rapid pulse. Provide emotional support because the patient may panic at the sight of a tube. A calm, reassuring manner can help minimize his fear. MOUTH AND ESOPHAGUS Stomatitis and other oral infections Stomatitis is an inflammation of the oral mucosa that may\\nextend to the buccal mucosa, lips, and palate. It's a common infection that may occur alone or as part of a systemic disease. There are two main types: acute herpetic stomatitis and aphthous stomatitis. Acute herpetic stomatitis is usually self-limiting; however, it may be severe and, in neonates, may be generalized and potentially fatal. Aphthous stomatitis usually heals spontaneously, without a scar, in 10 to 14 days. Other oral infections include gingivitis, candidiasis, glossitis, periodontitis, and Vincent's angina. (See Types of oral infections .) Causes and incidence Acute herpetic stomatitis results from the herpes simplex\\nvirus. It's common in children ages 1 to 3. The cause of aphthous stomatitis is unknown, but predisposing factors include stress, fatigue,\\nanxiety, febrile states, trauma, and solar overexposure. This type is common in young and teenage girls. Complications Nutritional deficiencies Esophagitis Sepsis Signs and symptoms Acute herpetic stomatitis begins suddenly with mouth pain, malaise, lethargy, anorexia, irritability, and fever, which may persist for 1 to 2 weeks. Gums are swollen and bleed easily, and the mucous membrane is extremely tender. Papulovesicular ulcers appear in the mouth and throat and\\neventually become punched-out lesions with reddened areolae. Submaxillary lymphadenitis is common. Pain usually disappears 2 to 4 days before healing of ulcers is complete. If the child with stomatitis sucks his thumb, these lesions spread to the hand. P A patient with aphthous stomatitis typically reports burning, tingling, and slight swelling of the mucous membrane. Single or\\nmultiple shallow ulcers with whitish centers and red borders appear and\\nheal at one site and then reappear at another. (See Looking at aphthous stomatitis , page 240.) Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the physical examination; in Vincent's angina, a smear of ulcer exudate allows for identification of the causative organism. TYPES OF ORAL INFECTIONS Disease and causes Signs and symptoms Treatment Candidiasis (infection of the oropharyngeal mucosa) \\u25aa Fungal infection caused by Candida albicans or related species \\u25aa High-risk patients include premature neonates, older adults, the immunosuppressed, and those taking antibiotics or long-term steroids \\u25aa cream-colored or bluish white patches of exudate on the tongue, mouth, or pharynx \\u25aa painful fissures at the corners of the mouth \\u25aa Antifungals for infection \\u25aa May benefit from eating active- culture yogurt or other live lactobacillus \\u25aa Topical anesthetic to relieve discomfort \\u25aa Nonirritating mouthwash to loosen tenacious secretions Gingivitis (inflammation of the gingiva) \\u25aa Early sign of hypovitaminosis, diabetes, blood dyscrasias \\u25aa Occasionally related to use of hormonal contraceptives \\u25aa\\nInflammation with painless swelling, redness, change of normal contours, bleeding, and periodontal pocket (gum detachment from teeth) \\u25aa Removal of irritating factors (calculus, faulty dentures) \\u25aa Good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups, vigorous chewing \\u25aa Oral or topical corticosteroids Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue) \\u25aa Streptococcal infection \\u25aa Irritation or injury; jagged teeth; ill-fitting dentures; biting during seizures; alcohol; spicy foods; smoking; sensitivity to toothpaste or mouthwash \\u25aa Vitamin B deficiency; anemia \\u25aa Skin conditions: lichen planus, erythema multiforme, pemphigus vulgaris \\u25aa Reddened, ulcerated, or swollen tongue (may obstruct airway) \\u25aa Painful chewing and swallowing \\u25aa Speech difficulty \\u25aa Painful tongue without inflammation \\u25aa Treatment of underlying cause \\u25aa Topical anesthetic mouthwash or systemic analgesics (acetaminophen) for painful lesions \\u25aa Good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups, vigorous chewing \\u25aa Avoidance of hot, cold, or spicy foods and alcohol Periodontitis (gingival infection and recession, loosening of teeth) \\u25aa Early sign of hypovitaminosis, diabetes, blood dyscrasias \\u25aa Occasionally related to use of hormonal contraceptives \\u25aa Dental factors: calculus, poor oral hygiene, malocclusion; major cause of tooth loss after middle age \\u25aa Acute onset of bright red gum inflammation, painless swelling of interdental papillae, easy bleeding \\u25aa Loosening of teeth, typically without inflammatory symptoms, progressing to loss of teeth and alveolar bone \\u25aa Acute systemic infection (fever, chills) \\u25aa Scaling, root planing, and curettage for infection control \\u25aa Periodontal surgery to prevent recurrence \\u25aa Good oral hygiene, regular dental checkups, vigorous chewing Vincent's angina (trench mouth, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis) \\u25aa Fusiform bacillus or spirochete \\u25aa Sudden onset: painful, \\u25aa Removal of P infection \\u25aa Predisposing factors: stress, poor oral hygiene, insufficient rest, nutritional deficiency, smoking superficial bleeding; gingival ulcers (rarely, on buccal mucosa) covered with a gray- white membrane \\u25aa Ulcers become punched-out lesions after slight pressure or irritation \\u25aa Malaise, mild fever, excessive salivation, bad breath, pain on swallowing or talking, enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes devitalized tissue with ultrasonic cavitron \\u25aa Antibiotics for infection \\u25aa Analgesics, as needed \\u25aa Hourly mouth rinses (with equal amounts of hydrogen peroxide and warm water) \\u25aa Soft, nonirritating diet; rest; no smoking \\u25aa With treatment, improvement common within 24 hours Treatment For acute herpetic stomatitis, treatment is conservative.\\nFor local symptoms, supportive measures include warm salt-water mouth rinses (antiseptic mouthwashes are contraindicated because they are irritating) and a topical anesthetic to relieve mouth ulcer pain. Topical antihistamines, antacids, or corticosteroids may also be recommended. Supplementary treatment includes a bland or liquid diet and, in severe cases, I.V. fluids and bed rest. LOOKING AT APHTHOUS STOMATITIS In aphthous stomatitis, numerous small, round vesicles appear. They soon break and leave shallow ulcers with red areolae. P For aphthous stomatitis, primary treatment is application\\nof a topical anesthetic. Effective long-term treatment requires alleviation or prevention of precipitating factors. Gastroesophageal reflux Gastroesophageal reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is the backflow of gastric or duodenal contents, or both, into the esophagus and past the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) without associated belching or vomiting. Reflux may cause symptoms or pathologic\\nchanges. Persistent reflux may cause reflux esophagitis (inflammation of the esophageal mucosa). Prognosis varies with the underlying cause. Causes and incidence The function of the LES\\u2014a high-pressure area in the lower\\nesophagus, just above the stomach\\u2014is to prevent gastric contents from backing up into the esophagus. Normally, the LES creates pressure, closing the lower end of the esophagus, but relaxes after each swallow to allow food into the stomach. Reflux occurs when LES pressure is deficient or when pressure within the stomach exceeds LES pressure. (See Influences on LES pressure .) Studies have shown that a patient with symptom-producing reflux can't swallow often enough to create sufficient peristaltic amplitude to clear gastric acid from the lower esophagus. This results in prolonged periods of acidity in the esophagus when reflux occurs. Predisposing factors include: pyloric surgery (alteration or removal of the pylorus), which allows reflux of bile or pancreatic juice long-term nasogastric (NG) intubation (more than 4 days) any agent that lowers LES pressure, such as food, alcohol, cigarettes; anticholinergics (atropine, belladonna, and propantheline); or other drugs (morphine, diazepam, calcium channel blockers, and meperidine) hiatal hernia with an incompetent sphincter any condition or position that increases intra-abdominal pressure, such as straining, bending, coughing, pregnancy, obesity, and recurrent or persistent vomiting. About 25% to 40% of Americans experience symptomatic GERD\\nat some point in their lives, while 7% to 10% of Americans experience symptoms on a daily basis. True incidence figures may be even higher because many people with GERD take over-the-counter remedies without reporting their symptoms. Studies show that GERD is common and may be overlooked in\\ninfants and children. It can cause repeated vomiting, coughing, and other respiratory problems. An immature digestive sytem is usually responsible, and most infants grow out of GERD by the time they are age 1. Complications Esophageal ulcer Esophageal stricture Barrett's esophagus Hoarseness Reflux esophagitis INFLUENCES ON LES PRESSURE Several factors can influence lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, thereby affecting reflux, as noted here. P Signs and symptoms GERD doesn't always cause symptoms, and in patients showing clinical effects, it isn't always possible to confirm physiologic reflux. The most common feature of GERD is heartburn, which may become more severe with vigorous exercise, bending, or lying down, and may be relieved by antacids or sitting upright. The pain of esophageal spasm resulting from reflux esophagitis tends to be chronic and may mimic angina pectoris, radiating to the neck, jaws, and arms. Other symptoms include odynophagia, which may be followed\\nby a dull substernal ache from severe, long-term reflux; dysphagia from esophageal spasm, stricture, or esophagitis; and bleeding (bright red or dark brown). Rarely, nocturnal regurgitation wakens the patient with coughing, choking, and a mouthful of saliva. Reflux may be associated with hiatal hernia. Direct hiatal hernia becomes clinically significant only when reflux is confirmed. Pulmonary symptoms result from reflux of gastric contents\\ninto the throat and subsequent aspiration; they include chronic pulmonary disease or nocturnal wheezing, bronchitis, asthma, morning hoarseness, and cough. In children, other signs consist of failure to thrive and forceful vomiting from esophageal irritation. Such vomiting sometimes causes aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS After a careful history and physical\\nexamination, tests to confirm GERD include barium swallow fluoroscopy, esophageal pH probe, esophageal manometry, and esophagoscopy. In children, barium esophagography under fluoroscopic control can show reflux. Recurrent reflux after age 6 weeks is abnormal. An acid perfusion (Bernstein) test can show that reflux is the cause of symptoms. Finally, endoscopy and biopsy allow visualization and confirmation of any pathologic changes in the mucosa. Treatment Promotility agents help increase LES sphincter tone and stimulate upper GI motility. Proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 (H 2 )\\nreceptor antagonists help reduce gastric acidity. If possible, NG intubation shouldn't be continued for more than 5 days because the tube interferes with sphincter integrity and allows reflux, especially when the patient lies flat. PEDIATRIC TIP Positional therapy is especially useful in infants and children who experience GERD without complications. Strategies, such as burping the infant several times during feeding, keeping the infant in an upright position for 30 minutes\\nafter feeding, and avoiding feeding 2 to 3 hours before bedtime, may help. Surgery may be necessary to control severe and refractory\\nsymptoms, such as pulmonary aspiration, hemorrhage, obstruction, severe\\npain, perforation, an incompetent LES, or associated hiatal hernia. Surgical procedures that create an artificial closure at the gastroesophageal junction may be needed in some patients. These include a\\nprocedure that invaginates the esophagus into the stomach and procedures that create a gastric wraparound with or without fixation. The fundoplication procedure can be performed endoscopically. Also, vagotomy or pyloroplasty may be combined with an antireflux regimen to modify gastric contents. Special considerations Teach the patient what causes reflux, how to avoid reflux\\nwith an antireflux regimen (medication, diet, and positional therapy), and what symptoms to watch for and report. Instruct the patient to avoid circumstances that increase intra- abdominal pressure (such as bending, coughing, vigorous exercise, tight clothing, constipation, and obesity) as well as substances that P reduce sphincter control (cigarettes, alcohol, fatty foods, and caffeine). Advise the patient to sit upright, particularly after meals, and to eat small, frequent meals. Tell him to avoid highly seasoned food, acidic juices, alcoholic drinks, bedtime snacks, and foods high in fat or carbohydrates, which reduce LES pressure. He should eat meals at least 2 to 3 hours before lying down. Tell the patient to take antacids, as ordered (usually 1 hour before or 3 hours after meals and at bedtime). Teach the patient correct preparation for diagnostic testing. For example, he shouldn't eat for 6 to 8 hours before a barium swallow or endoscopy. After surgery using a thoracic approach, carefully watch and record chest tube drainage and the patient's respiratory status. If needed, give chest physiotherapy and oxygen. Position the patient with an NG tube in semi-Fowler's position to help prevent reflux. Offer reassurance and emotional support. (See Preventing GI reflux .) PREVENTION PREVENTING GI REFLUX Changing his lifestyle will help the patient to prevent GI reflux. Diet and eating habits Foods, such as caffeine, chocolate, spicy food, carbonated beverages, orange juice, liquor, wine, and tomato sauce, stimulate the production of acid. Large meals expand the stomach and put\\npressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Gravity helps keep the stomach juices from backing up into the esophagus: Don't allow the patient to lie down for 2 hours after eating. If nighttime heartburn is a\\nconcern, raise the head of the bed 6 to 8 inches because a flat position places pressure on the LES. Weight Being overweight increases abdominal pressure, which can then push stomach contents up into the esophagus. Smoking Nicotine relaxes the esophageal sphincter and stimulates the production of stomach acid. Smoking also may injure the esophagus by\\ncausing irritation making it more susceptible to damage from acid reflux. Smoking can decrease gastric motility and reduce the effectiveness of digestion because the stomach takes longer to empty. Stress Although stress itself doesn't cause heartburn, the anxiety that comes along with stress can lead to behaviors that increase\\nthe risk of heartburn, such as overeating, drinking, and smoking. Alcohol Alcohol can increase the production of stomach acid and can also lower the esophageal sphincter, which allows stomach acids to move up into the esophagus. Alcohol also makes the esophagus more sensitive to stomach acid. Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia Tracheoesophageal fistula is a developmental anomaly characterized by an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. It usually accompanies esophageal atresia, in which the esophagus is closed off at some point. Although these malformations have\\nnumerous anatomic variations, the most common, by far, is esophageal atresia with fistula to the distal segment. (See Types of tracheoesophageal anomalies , pages 244 and 245.) These disorders, two of the most serious surgical emergencies in neonates, require immediate diagnosis and correction. They may coexist P with other serious anomalies, such as congenital heart disease, imperforate anus, genitourinary abnormalities, and intestinal atresia. TYPES OF TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL ANOMALIES Congenital malformations of the esophagus occur in about 1\\nin 4,000 live births. The American Academy of Pediatrics classifies the\\nanatomic variations of tracheoesophageal anomalies as follows. \\u25aa Type A (7.7%): esophageal atresia without fistula \\u25aa Type B (0.8%): esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula to the proximal segment \\u25aa Type C (86.5%): esophageal atresia with fistula to the distal segment \\u25aa Type D (0.7%): esophageal atresia with fistula to both segments \\u25aa Type E (or H-Type) (4.2%): tracheoesophageal fistula without atresia Causes and incidence Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia result from failure of the embryonic esophagus and trachea to develop and separate correctly. Respiratory system development begins at about day 26 of gestation. Abnormal development of the septum during this time can\\nlead to tracheoesophageal fistula. The most common abnormality is type C tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, in which the upper section of the esophagus terminates in a blind pouch, and the lower section ascends from the stomach and connects with the trachea by a short fistulous tract. In type A atresia, both esophageal segments are blind pouches, and neither is connected to the airway. In type E (or H-type), tracheoesophageal fistula without atresia, the fistula may occur anywhere between the level of the cricoid cartilage and the midesophagus, but is usually higher in the trachea than in the esophagus. Such a fistula may be as small as a pinpoint. In types B and P D, the upper portion of the esophagus opens into the trachea; neonates with this anomaly may experience life-threatening aspiration of saliva or food. Esophageal atresia occurs in about 1 of every 1,500 to 3,000 live births; about one-third of these neonates are born prematurely. Complications Recurrent fistulas Abnormal esphageal motility Pneumothorax Esophageal stricture Signs and symptoms A neonate with type C tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia appears to swallow normally but soon after swallowing coughs, struggles, becomes cyanotic, and stops breathing as he aspirates fluids returning from the blind pouch of the esophagus through his nose and mouth. Stomach distention may cause respiratory distress; air and gastric contents (bile and gastric secretions) may reflux through the fistula into the trachea, resulting in chemical pneumonitis. An infant with type A esophageal atresia appears normal at birth. The infant swallows normally, but as secretions fill the esophageal sac and overflow into the oropharynx, he develops mucus in the oropharynx and drools excessively. When the infant is fed, regurgitation and respiratory distress follow aspiration. Suctioning the\\nmucus and secretions temporarily relieves these symptoms. Excessive secretions and drooling in the neonate strongly suggest esophageal atresia. Repeated episodes of pneumonitis, pulmonary infection, and abdominal distention may signal type E (or H-type) tracheoesophageal\\nfistula. When a child with this disorder drinks, he coughs, chokes, and\\nbecomes cyanotic. Excessive mucus builds up in the oropharynx. Crying forces air from the trachea into the esophagus, producing abdominal distention. Because such a child may appear normal at birth, this type of P tracheoesophageal fistula may be overlooked, and diagnosis may be delayed as long as 1 year. Type B (proximal fistula) and type D (fistula to both segments) cause immediate aspiration of saliva into the airway and bacterial pneumonitis. Diagnosis Respiratory distress and drooling in a neonate suggest tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia. The following procedures confirm the diagnosis: A size 10 or 12 French catheter passed through the nose meets an obstruction (esophageal atresia) approximately 4\\u2033 to 5\\u2033 (10 to 12.5 cm) distal from the nostrils. Aspirate of gastric contents is less acidic than normal. Chest X-ray demonstrates the position of the catheter and can also show a dilated, air-filled upper esophageal pouch, pneumonia in the right upper lobe, or bilateral pneumonitis. Both\\npneumonia and pneumonitis suggest aspiration. Abdominal X-ray shows gas in the bowel in a\\ndistal fistula (type C) but none in a proximal fistula (type B) or in atresia without fistula (type A). Cinefluorography allows visualization on a\\nfluoroscopic screen. After a size 10 or 12 French catheter is passed through the patient's nostril into the esophagus, a small amount of contrast medium is instilled to define the tip of the upper pouch and to\\ndifferentiate between overflow aspiration from a blind end (atresia) and aspiration due to passage of liquid through a tracheoesophageal fistula. Treatment Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia require surgical correction and are usually surgical emergencies. The type and timing of surgical procedure depend on the nature of the anomaly, the patient's general condition, and the presence of coexisting congenital defects. In premature neonates (nearly 33% of neonates with this anomaly\\nare born prematurely) who are poor surgical risks, correction of combined tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia is done in two\\nstages: first, gastrostomy (for gastric decompression, prevention of reflux, and feeding) and closure of the fistula; then, 1 to 2 months later, anastomosis of the esophagus. Before and after surgery, positioning varies with the physician's philosophy and the infant's anatomy: the infant may be placed supine, with his head low to facilitate drainage, or with his head elevated to prevent aspiration. The infant should receive I.V. fluids, as necessary, and appropriate antibiotics for superimposed infection. Postoperative complications after correction of tracheoesophageal fistula include recurrent fistulas, esophageal motility dysfunction, esophageal stricture, recurrent bronchitis, pneumothorax, and failure to thrive. Esophageal motility dysfunction or hiatal hernia may develop after surgery to correct esophageal atresia. Correction of esophageal atresia alone requires anastomosis of the proximal and distal esophageal segments in one or two\\nstages. End-to- end anastomosis commonly produces postoperative stricture; end-toside anastomosis is less likely to do so. If the esophageal ends are widely separated, treatment may include a colonic interposition (grafting a piece of the colon) or elongation of the proximal segment of the esophagus by bougienage. About 10 days after surgery, and again 1 and 3 months later, X-rays are required to evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of surgical repair. Postoperative treatment includes placement of a suction catheter in the upper esophageal pouch to control secretions and prevent\\naspiration, maintaining the infant in an upright position to avoid reflux of gastric juices into the trachea, I.V. fluids (nothing by mouth), gastrostomy to prevent reflux and allow feeding, and appropriate\\nantibiotics for pneumonia. Postoperative complications may include impaired esophageal motility (in one-third of patients), hiatal hernia, and reflux esophagitis. Special considerations P Postoperative care should include the following: Monitor the infant's respiratory status. Administer oxygen and perform pulmonary physiotherapy and suctioning, as\\nneeded. Provide a humid environment. Administer antibiotics and parenteral fluids, as ordered. Keep accurate intake and output records. If the infant has chest tubes postoperatively, check them frequently for patency. Maintain proper suction; measure and mark drainage periodically. Observe carefully for signs of complications. Maintain gastrostomy tube feedings, as ordered. Such feedings initially consist of dextrose and water (not more\\nthan 5% solution); later, add a proprietary formula (first diluted and then full strength). If the infant develops gastric atony, use an isoosmolar formula. Oral feedings can usually resume 8 to 10 days postoperatively. If gastrostomy feedings\\nand oral feedings are impossible because of intolerance to them or decreased intestinal motility, the infant requires total parenteral nutrition. If the infant can safely handle secretions, he may be given a pacifier to satisfy his sucking needs; however, this is done only when he can safely handle secretions because sucking stimulates saliva secretion. Offer the parents support and guidance in dealing with their infant's acute illness. Encourage them to participate\\nin the infant's care and to hold and touch him as much as possible to facilitate bonding. Corrosive esophagitis and stricture Corrosive esophagitis is inflammation and damage to the esophagus after ingestion of a caustic chemical. Similar to a burn, this\\ninjury may be temporary or may lead to permanent stricture (narrowing or stenosis) of the esophagus that's correctable only through surgery. Severe injury can quickly lead to esophageal perforation, mediastinitis,\\nand death from infection, shock, and massive hemorrhage (due to aortic perforation). Causes and incidence The most common chemical injury to the esophagus follows the ingestion of lye or other strong alkali; ingestion of strong acids is less common. The type and amount of chemical ingested determine the severity and location of the damage. In children, household chemical ingestion is accidental; in adults, it's usually a suicide attempt or gesture. The chemical may damage only the mucosa or submucosa or it may damage all layers of the esophagus. Esophageal tissue damage occurs in three phases: the acute phase, consisting of edema and inflammation; the latent phase, with ulceration, exudation, and tissue sloughing; and the chronic phase,\\nin which there is diffuse scarring. Gastroesophageal reflux disease accounts for 70% to 80% of all cases of esophageal stricture. Postoperative strictures account for 10% of all cases, and corrosive strictures account for less than 5% of all cases. Peptic strictures are 10 times more common in Whites than in Blacks and Asians and two to three times more common in men than in women. Complications Esophageal perforation Mediastinitis Infection, massive hemorrhage, shock Signs and symptoms Effects vary from none at all to intense pain and edema n\\nthe mouth, anterior chest pain, marked salivation, inability to swallow, and tachypnea. Bloody vomitus containing pieces of esophageal tissue signals severe damage. Signs of esophageal perforation and mediastinitis, especially crepitation, indicate destruction of the entire esophagus. Inability to speak implies laryngeal damage. The acute phase subsides in 3 to 4 days, enabling the patient to eat again. Fever suggests secondary infection. Symptoms of dysphagia return P if stricture develops, usually within weeks; rarely, stricture is delayed and develops several years after the injury. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A history of chemical ingestion and physical examination revealing oropharyngeal burns (including white membranes and edema of the soft palate and uvula) usually confirm the diagnosis. The type and amount of the chemical ingested must be identified; this may be done by examining the container of the ingested material or by calling the poison control center. Two procedures are helpful in evaluating the severity of the injury: Endoscopy (in the first 24 hours after ingestion) delineates the extent and location of the esophageal injury and assesses the depth of the burn. This procedure may also be performed\\na week after ingestion to assess stricture development. Barium swallow (1 week after ingestion and every 3 weeks thereafter) may identify segmental spasm or fistula, but doesn't always show mucosal injury. Treatment Conservative treatment of corrosive esophagitis and stricture includes monitoring the patient's condition; early endoscopy; administering corticosteroids, such as prednisone and hydrocortisone, to\\ncontrol inflammation and inhibit fibrosis; and using a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as ampicillin, to protect the corticosteroidimmunosuppressed patient against infection by his own mouth flora. Treatment may also include bougienage, a procedure in which a slender, flexible, cylindrical instrument called a bougie is passed into the esophagus to dilate it and minimize stricture. Some physicians begin bougienage immediately and continue it regularly to maintain a patent lumen and prevent stricture; others delay it for a week to avoid the risk of esophageal perforation. Surgery is needed immediately for esophageal perforation or later to correct stricture untreatable with bougienage. Corrective surgery may involve transplanting a piece of the colon to the damaged esophagus. However, even after surgery, stricture may recur at the site of the anastomosis. Supportive treatment includes I.V. therapy to replace fluids or total parenteral nutrition while the patient can't swallow, gradually progressing to clear liquids and a soft diet. Special considerations If you're the first health care professional to see the patient who has ingested a corrosive chemical, the quality of your emergency care will be critical. To meet this challenge, follow these important guidelines: Don't induce vomiting or lavage because this will expose the esophagus and oropharynx to additional injury. Don't perform gastric lavage because the corrosive chemical may cause further damage to the mucous membrane of the GI lining. Provide vigorous support of vital functions, as needed, such as oxygen, mechanical ventilation, administration of I.V. fluids, and treatment for shock, depending on the\\nseverity of the injury. Carefully observe and record intake and output. Before X-rays and endoscopy, explain the procedure to the patient to lessen anxiety during the tests and to obtain cooperation. Because the adult who has ingested a corrosive agent has usually done so with suicidal intent, assist him and\\nhis family in seeking psychological counseling. Monitor the patient according to facility protocol if the attempt was a suicide. Provide emotional support for parents whose child has ingested a chemical. They'll be distraught and may feel guilty about the accident. P Encourage long-term follow-up because of the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. PREVENTION Tell parents to lock accessible cabinets and keep all corrosive agents out of a child's reach without emphasizing blame. Mallory-Weiss syndrome Mallory-Weiss syndrome is mild to massive, usually painless bleeding due to a tear in the mucosa or submucosa of the cardia\\nor lower esophagus. Such a tear, usually singular and longitudinal, results from prolonged or forceful vomiting. Sixty percent of these tears involve the cardia; 15%, the terminal esophagus; and 25%, the region across the esophagogastric junction. Causes and incidence Forceful or prolonged vomiting can cause esophageal tearing when the upper esophageal sphincter fails to relax during vomiting; this lack of sphincter coordination seems more common after excessive alcohol intake. Other factors that can increase intra-abdominal pressure and predispose a person to this type of tear include coughing, straining during bowel movements, traumatic injury, seizures, childbirth, hiatal hernia, esophagitis, gastritis, and atrophic gastric mucosa. Mallory-Weiss syndrome accounts for 1% to 15% of all cases of upper GI bleeding. It's two to four times more common in men than in women. There's no racial predilection. Patients usually present with symptoms during their 40s and 50s, but it can affect people of all ages. Complications Hypovolemia (if bleeding is excessive) Fatal shock Signs and symptoms Mallory-Weiss syndrome typically begins with vomiting of blood or passing large amounts of blood rectally a few hours to several days after forceful vomiting. The bleeding, which may be accompanied by epigastric or back pain, may range from mild to massive, but is usually more profuse than in esophageal rupture. In Mallory-Weiss syndrome, the blood vessels are only partially severed, preventing retraction and closure of the lumen. ALERT Massive bleeding\\u2014most likely when the tear is on the gastric side, near the cardia\\u2014may quickly lead to fatal shock. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Fiberoptic endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) confirms Mallory-Weiss syndrome by identifying esophageal tears. Recent tears appear as erythematous longitudinal cracks in the mucosa; older tears appear as raised white streaks surrounded by erythema. Treatment Treatment varies with the severity of bleeding. GI bleeding usually stops spontaneously, thereafter requiring supportive measures and careful observation but no definitive treatment. However, if bleeding continues, treatment may include: proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists to help decrease acidity blood transfusions if blood loss is great endoscopy with electrocoagulation or heater probe for hemostasis transcatheter embolization or thrombus formation with an autologous blood clot or other hemostatic material (such as a shredded adsorbable gelatin sponge) surgery to suture each esophageal laceration. Special considerations Observation is necessary to determine whether bleeding is transitory or ongoing. Evaluate the patient's respiratory status, monitor arterial blood gas values, and administer oxygen as necessary. Assess the amount of blood lost and record the color, amount, consistency, and frequency of hematemesis and melena. Draw blood for coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count), and type and crossmatch. Try to keep 3 units of blood available at all times. Insert a 14G to 18G I.V. line, and start an infusion of I.V. solution, as ordered. (If the I.V. infusion is for blood transfusion, use normal saline solution; if the infusion is for fluid replacement, use lactated Ringer's solution or another appropirate solution, depending on the results of laboratory tests.) Monitor the patient's vital signs, central venous pressure, urine output, neurologic status, and overall clinical status. Explain diagnostic tests to the patient. Keep the patient warm and maintain a safe environment. Obtain a detailed history of recent medications taken, dietary habits, and alcohol ingestion. Administer antiemetics, as ordered, to prevent postoperative retching and vomiting. Advise the patient to avoid aspirin, alcohol, and other irritating substances. Esophageal diverticula P Esophageal diverticula are hollow outpouchings of one or more layers of the esophageal wall. They occur in three main areas: just\\nabove the upper esophageal sphincter (Zenker's, or pulsion, diverticulum, the most common type); near the midpoint of the esophagus (traction); and just above the lower esophageal sphincter (epiphrenic). Generally, esophageal diverticula occur later in life\\u2014although they can affect infants and children\\u2014and are three times more common in men than in women. Epiphrenic diverticula usually occur in middle-aged men, whereas Zenker's diverticula typically affect men older than age 60. Causes and incidence Esophageal diverticula are due to primary muscular abnormalities that may be congenital or to inflammatory processes adjacent to the esophagus. Zenker's diverticulum occurs when the pouch results from increased intraesophageal pressure; traction diverticulum occurs when the pouch is pulled out by adjacent inflamed tissue or lymph\\nnodes. Some authorities classify all diverticula as traction diverticula. Zenker's diverticulum results from developmental muscular\\nweakness of the posterior pharynx above the border of the cricopharyngeal muscle. The pressure of swallowing aggravates this weakness, as does contraction of the pharynx before relaxation of the sphincter. A midesophageal (traction) diverticulum is a response to scarring and pulling on esophageal walls by an external inflammatory process such as tuberculosis. An epiphrenic diverticulum (rare) is generally right-sided and usually accompanies an esophageal motor disturbance, such as esophageal spasm or achalasia. It's thought to be caused by traction and pulsation. Most diverticula occur in middle-aged and elderly patients. Zenker's diverticula most commonly in patients older than age 50 and are especially prevalent in patients in their 70s and 80s. Complications Malnutrition Dehydration Signs and symptoms Midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula with an associated motor disturbance (achalasia or spasm) seldom produce symptoms, although the patient may experience dysphagia and heartburn. Zenker's diverticulum, however, produces distinctly staged symptoms, beginning with initial throat irritation followed by dysphagia and near-complete obstruction. In early stages, regurgitation occurs soon after eating; in later stages, regurgitation after eating is delayed and\\nmay even occur during sleep, leading to food aspiration and pulmonary infection. ELDER TIP Hoarseness, asthma, and pneumonitis may be the only signs of esophageal diverticula in elderly patients. Other signs and symptoms include noise when liquids are swallowed, chronic cough, hoarseness, a bad taste in the mouth or foul breath and, rarely, bleeding. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS X-rays taken following a barium swallow usually confirm the diagnosis by showing characteristic outpouching. Esophagoscopy can rule out another lesion; however, the procedure risks rupturing the diverticulum by passing the scope into it rather than into the lumen of the esophagus, a special danger with Zenker's diverticulum. Treatment Treatment of Zenker's diverticulum is usually palliative and includes a bland diet, thorough chewing, and drinking water after eating to flush out the sac. However, severe symptoms or a large diverticulum necessitates surgery to remove the sac or facilitate drainage. An esophagomyotomy may be necessary to prevent recurrence. Endscopic P stapling or laser surgery using CO 2 microscopy are commonly performed in patients who can't tolerate traditional surgeries. A midesophageal diverticulum seldom requires therapy except when esophagitis aggravates the risk of rupture, in which case treatment includes antacids and an antireflux regimen: keeping the head elevated, maintaining an upright position for 2 hours after eating, eating small meals, controlling chronic coughing, and avoiding constrictive clothing. Epiphrenic diverticulum requires treatment of accompanying motor disorders. Achalasia is treated by repeated dilations\\nof the esophagus; acute spasm is controlled by anticholinergic administration and diverticulum excision; and dysphagia or severe pain are relieved by surgical excision or suspending the diverticulum to promote drainage. Treatment may also include parenteral feeding to improve the patient's nutritional status. Special considerations Care includes documenting the patient's symptoms and nutritional status and educating him about the disorder. Regularly assess the patient's nutritional status (weight, calorie intake, and appearance). If the patient regurgitates food and mucus, protect against aspiration by positioning him carefully (head elevated or turned to one side). To prevent aspiration, tell the patient\\nto empty any visible outpouching in the neck by massage or postural drainage before retiring. If the patient has dysphagia, record welltolerated foods and what circumstances ease swallowing. Provide a pureed diet, with vitamin or protein supplements, and encourage thorough\\nchewing. Teach the patient about this disorder. Explain treatment instructions and diagnostic procedures. Hiatal hernia Hiatal hernia, also called hiatus hernia, is a defect in the diaphragm that permits a portion of the stomach to pass through the diaphragmatic P opening into the chest. Hiatal hernia is the most common problem of the diaphragm affecting the alimentary canal.\\nTwo types of hiatal hernia can occur: sliding hernia and paraesophageal\\nhernia. (See Types of hiatal hernia. )\\nIn a sliding hernia, the stomach and the gastroesophageal junction slip\\nup into the chest, so the gastroesophageal junction is above the diaphragmatic hiatus. In paraesophageal hernia, a part of the greater curvature of the stomach rolls through the diaphragmatic defect. Treatment can prevent complications such as strangulation of the herniated intrathoracic portion of the stomach. Causes and incidence Hiatal hernia typically results from muscle weakening that's common with aging and may be secondary to esophageal carcinoma, kyphoscoliosis, trauma, or certain surgical procedures. It may also result from certain diaphragmatic malformations that may cause congenital weakness. Obesity and smoking are common risk factors. TYPES OF HIATAL HERNIA A hiatal hernia is a displacement of the normal anatomy, as shown in the illustrations below. In hiatal hernia, the muscular collar around the esophageal and diaphragmatic junction loosens, permitting the lower portion of the esophagus and the stomach to rise into the chest when intra-abdominal pressure increases (possibly causing gastroesophageal reflux). Such increased intra-abdominal pressure may result from ascites, pregnancy, obesity, constrictive clothing, bending, straining, coughing, Valsalva's maneuver, or extreme physical exertion. Sliding hernias are more common than paraesophageal hernias. The incidence of hiatal hernia increases with age (most occur in people older than age 40), and prevalence is higher in women than in men (especially the paraesophageal type). Contributing factors include obesity and trauma. No racial predilection exists. Complications Dysphagia Gastroesophageal reflux Barrett's esophagus Esophageal adenocarcinoma Signs and symptoms Typically, a paraesophageal hernia produces no symptoms; it's usually an incidental finding during a barium swallow or when testing for occult blood. Because this type of hernia leaves the closing\\nmechanism of the cardiac sphincter unchanged, it rarely causes acid reflux or reflux esophagitis. Symptoms result from displacement or stretching of the stomach and may include a feeling of fullness in the chest or pain resembling angina pectoris. Even if it produces no symptoms, this type of hernia needs surgical treatment because of the high risk of strangulation that can occur when a large portion of stomach becomes caught above the diaphragm. A sliding hernia without an incompetent sphincter produces no reflux or symptoms and, consequently, doesn't require treatment. When a sliding hernia causes symptoms, they are typical of gastric reflux, resulting from the incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and may include the following: P Pyrosis (heartburn) occurs 1 to 4 hours after eating (especially overeating) and is aggravated by reclining, belching, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. It may be accompanied by regurgitation or vomiting. Retrosternal or substernal chest pain results from reflux of gastric contents, stomach distention, and spasm or altered motor activity. Chest pain usually occurs after meals or at bedtime and is aggravated by reclining, belching, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Other common symptoms reflect possible complications: Dysphagia occurs when the hernia produces esophagitis, esophageal ulceration, or stricture, especially with ingestion of very hot or cold foods, alcoholic beverages, or a large amount of food. Bleeding may be mild or massive, frank or occult; the source may be esophagitis or erosions of the gastric pouch. Severe pain and shock result from incarceration, in which a large portion of the stomach is caught above the diaphragm (usually occurs with paraesophageal hernia). Incarceration\\nmay lead to perforation of the gastric ulcer and strangulation and gangrene of the herniated portion of the stomach. It requires immediate surgery. Diagnosis Diagnosis of hiatal hernia is based on typical clinical features and on the results of these laboratory studies and procedures: In barium study, hernia may appear as an outpouching containing barium at the lower end of the esophagus. Small hernias, however, are difficult to recognize. This study also shows diaphragmatic abnormalities. Endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and\\nbiopsy differentiate among hiatal hernia, varices, and other small gastroesophageal lesions; identify the mucosal junction and the edge of the diaphragm indenting the esophagus; and can rule out malignancy that otherwise may be difficult to detect. Esophageal motility studies assess the presence of esophageal motor abnormalities before surgical repair of the hernia. pH studies assess for reflux of gastric contents. Treatment The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms by\\nminimizing or correcting the incompetent cardia and to manage and prevent complications. Medical therapy is used first because symptoms usually respond to it and because hiatal hernia tends to recur after surgery. Such therapy attempts to modify or reduce reflux by changing the quantity or quality of refluxed gastric contents, by strengthening the LES muscle pharmacologically, or by decreasing the amount of reflux through gravity. These measures include restricting any activity that raises intra- abdominal pressure (coughing, straining, or bending), giving antiemetics, avoiding constrictive clothing, modifying diet, giving stool softeners or laxatives to prevent straining at stool, and discouraging smoking because it stimulates gastric acid production. Modifying the diet means eating small, frequent, bland meals at least 2 hours before lying down (no bedtime snack), eating slowly, and avoiding spicy foods, fruit juices, alcoholic beverages, and\\ncoffee. Antacids also modify the fluid refluxed into the esophagus and are probably the best treatment for intermittent reflux. To reduce the amount of reflux, the overweight patient should lose weight to decrease intra-abdominal pressure. Elevating the head of the bed 6\\u2033 (15 cm) reduces gastric reflux by gravity. Drug therapy to strengthen cardiac sphincter tone may include a cholinergic agent or a GI stimulant to enhance smooth-muscle contraction, increase cardiac sphincter tone, and decrease reflux after eating. Surgical repair is necessary when symptoms can't be controlled medically or with the onset of complications, such as stricture, bleeding, pulmonary aspiration, strangulation, or incarceration. Surgery typically involves creating an artificial closing\\nmechanism at the gastroesophageal junction to strengthen the LES's barrier function. The surgeon may use an abdominal or a thoracic approach or he may repair the hernia by P laparoscopic surgery, which allows for less dependence on a nasogastric (NG) tube and a shorter hospital stay. Special considerations To enhance compliance with treatment, teach the patient about this disorder. Explain treatments, diagnostic tests, and significant symptoms. Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests as needed. After endoscopy, watch for signs of perforation (falling blood pressure, rapid pulse, shock, and sudden pain). If surgery is scheduled, review preoperative and postoperative considerations with the patient. After surgery, carefully record intake and output, including NG tube and wound drainage. While the NG tube is in place, provide meticulous mouth and nose care, but don't manipulate the tube. Give ice chips, if permitted, to moisten oral mucous membranes. If the surgeon used a thoracic approach, the patient may have chest tubes in place. Carefully observe chest tube drainage and the patient's respiratory status, and perform pulmonary physiotherapy. Before discharge, tell the patient what foods he can eat, and recommend small, frequent meals. Warn against activities that cause increased intra-abdominal pressure, and advise a slow return to normal functions (within 6 to 8 weeks). STOMACH, INTESTINE, AND PANCREAS Gastritis Gastritis, an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, may be acute or chronic. Acute gastritis produces mucosal reddening, edema, hemorrhage, and erosion. Chronic gastritis is common among elderly people and people with pernicious anemia. It typically occurs as chronic atrophic gastritis, in which all stomach mucosal layers are inflamed, with reduced numbers of chief and parietal cells. Acute or chronic gastritis can occur at any age. Causes and incidence Acute gastritis has numerous causes, including: chronic ingestion of (or an allergic reaction to) irritating foods or beverages, such as hot peppers or alcohol drugs, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (in large doses), cytotoxic agents, corticosteroids, antimetabolites, phenylbutazone, and indomethacin ingestion of poisons, especially DDT, ammonia, mercury, carbon tetrachloride, and corrosive substances endotoxins released from infecting bacteria, such as staphylococci, Escherichia coli, or salmonella. Acute gastritis leading to stress ulcers also may develop\\nin acute illnesses, especially when the patient has had major traumatic\\ninjuries; burns; severe infection; hepatic, renal, or respiratory failure; or major surgery. Chronic gastritis may be associated with peptic ulcer disease or gastrostomy, both of which cause chronic reflux of pancreatic secretions, bile, and bile acids from the duodenum into the stomach. Recurring exposure to irritating substances, such as drugs, alcohol, cigarette smoke, or environmental agents, may also lead to chronic gastritis. Chronic gastritis may occur with pernicious anemia, renal disease, or diabetes mellitus. Pernicious anemia is commonly associated with atrophic gastritis, a chronic inflammation of the stomach resulting from degeneration of the gastric mucosa. In pernicious anemia, the stomach can no longer secrete intrinsic factor, which is needed for vitamin B 12 absorption. Bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori is a common cause of nonerosive chronic gastritis. About 35% of adults are infected with H. pylori, but the prevalence of H. pylori infection in minority groups and in immigrants is much higher. Children\\nages 2 to 8 in developing nations acquire the infection at a rate of 10% per year; in the United States, the rate of yearly infection is less\\nthan 1%. Complications Hemorrhage Shock Obstruction Perforation Peritonitis Gastric cancer Signs and symptoms After exposure to the offending substance, the patient with acute gastritis typically reports a rapid onset of symptoms, such as epigastric discomfort, indigestion, cramping, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis. The symptoms last from a few hours to a few days. The patient with chronic gastritis may describe similar symptoms or may have only mild epigastric discomfort, or his complaints may be vague, such as an intolerance for spicy or fatty foods or slight pain relieved by eating. The patient with chronic atrophic gastritis may\\nbe asymptomatic. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or gastroscopy (with biopsy) confirms gastritis when done before lesions heal (usually within 24 hours). This test is contraindicated after ingestion of a corrosive agent. Laboratory analyses can detect occult blood in vomitus or\\nstool (or both) if the patient has gastric bleeding. Hemoglobin level and hematocrit are decreased if the patient has developed anemia from bleeding. Treatment P Treatment for gastritis focuses on eliminating the cause;\\nfor example, bacterial gastritis is treated with antibiotics, whereas gastritis caused by ingested poison is treated by neutralizing the poison with the appropriate antidote. Histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists may block gastric secretions. Many over-the-counter\\npreparations are available. Antacids may be used as buffers. For critically ill patients, antacids administered hourly, with or without H 2 -receptor antagonists, may reduce the frequency of gastritis attacks. Some patients also require analgesics. Until healing occurs, patients' oxygen needs, blood volume, and fluid and electrolyte balance must be monitored. When gastritis causes massive bleeding, treatment includes blood replacement; iced saline lavage, possibly with norepinephrine; angiography with vasopressin infused in normal saline solution; and, sometimes, surgery. Vagotomy and pyloroplasty achieve limited success when conservative treatments fail. Rarely, partial or total gastrectomy may be required. Simply avoiding aspirin and spicy foods may prevent exacerbations of chronic gastritis. If symptoms develop or persist, antacids may be taken. If pernicious anemia is the cause, vitamin B 12 may be administered parenterally. A combination of bismuth and an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, may relieve H. pylori infection, but eradication is difficult. Special considerations Patient care includes education and attention to various aspects of nutritional status to control symptoms and prevent their recurrence. For vomiting, give antiemetics and I.V. fluids, as ordered. Monitor fluid intake and output and electrolyte levels. Monitor the patient for recurrent symptoms as food is reintroduced; provide a bland diet. Offer smaller, more frequent meals to reduce irritating gastric secretions. Eliminate foods that cause gastric upset. Administer antacids and other prescribed medications, as ordered. If pain or nausea interferes with the patient's appetite, give analgesics or antiemetics 1 hour before meals. Tell the patient to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and irritating foods such as spicy or highly seasoned foods. If the patient smokes, refer him to a smoking-cessation program. Urge the patient to seek immediate attention for recurring symptoms, such as hematemesis, nausea, or vomiting. To prevent exacerbation, urge the patient to take prophylactic medications, as ordered. PREVENTION Advise the patient to take steroids with milk, food, or antacids. Instruct him to take antacids between meals and at bedtime and to avoid aspirin-containing compounds. Gastroenteritis A self-limiting disorder, gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and acute or chronic abdominal cramping. Also called intestinal flu, traveler's diarrhea, viral enteritis, or food poisoning, it occurs in persons of all ages and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in underdeveloped nations. In the United States, gastroenteritis ranks second to the common cold as a leading cause of lost work time and fifth as the leading cause of death among young children. It also can be life-threatening in elderly or debilitated people. Causes and incidence Gastroenteritis has many possible causes, including: bacteria (responsible for acute food poisoning), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium botulinum, C. perfringens, and Escherichia coli amebae, especially Entamoeba histolytica P parasites, such as Ascaris, Enterobius, and Trichinella spiralis viruses (may be responsible for traveler's diarrhea) such as adenoviruses, echoviruses, or coxsackieviruses ingestion of toxins, including plants or toadstools drug reactions; for example, to antibiotics enzyme deficiencies food allergens. The bowel reacts to any of these enterotoxins with hypermotility, producing severe diarrhea and secondary depletion of intracellular fluid. Chronic gastroenteritis is usually the result of another GI disorder such as ulcerative colitis. Diarrhea accounts for as many as 3% of pediatric office visits and 10% of hospitalizations for patients younger than age 5. Each\\nyear, gastroenteritis affects many adults and accounts for 8 million physician visits and 250,000 hospitalizations. Traveler's diarrhea affects 20% to 25% of people traveling from industrialized countries to developing countries. Complications Severe dehydration Electrolyte loss Shock Vascular collapse Renal failure Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms vary depending on the pathologic organism and on the level of GI tract involved. However, gastroenteritis\\nin adults is usually an acute, self-limiting, nonfatal disease producing diarrhea, abdominal discomfort (ranging from cramping to pain), nausea, and vomiting. Other possible signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, and borborygmi. In children, the elderly, and the debilitated, gastroenteritis produces the same symptoms, but these patients' intolerance to electrolyte and fluid losses leads to a higher mortality. Diagnosis Patient history can aid in the diagnosis of gastroenteritis. Stool culture (by direct rectal swab) or blood culture identifies the causative bacteria or parasites. Treatment Treatment is usually supportive and consists of bed rest,\\nnutritional support, and increased fluid intake. When gastroenteritis is severe or affects a young child or an elderly or debilitated person, treatment may necessitate hospitalization, specific antimicrobials, I.V.\\nfluid and electrolyte replacement and, possibly, antiemetics (given orally, I.M., or by rectal suppository). Special considerations Patient care includes education, administering medications, and assessing symptoms for signs of improvement or worsening. Administer medications as ordered; correlate dosages, routes, and times appropriately with the patient's meals and activities (for example, give antiemetics 30 to 60 minutes before meals). If the patient can eat, replace lost fluids and electrolytes with broth, ginger ale, and lemonade, as tolerated. Vary the diet to make it more enjoyable, and allow some choice of foods. Warn the patient to avoid milk and milk products, which\\nmay provoke recurrence. Record intake and output carefully and obtain serial weight measurements. Watch for signs of dehydration, such as dry skin and mucous membranes, fever, and sunken eyes. Wash your hands thoroughly after giving care to avoid spreading infection. To ease anal irritation, provide warm sitz baths or apply witch hazel compresses. P If food poisoning is the likely cause of gastroenteritis, contact public health authorities so they can interview\\npatients and food handlers, and take samples of the suspected contaminated food. PREVENTION Teach good hygiene to prevent recurrence. Instruct patients to cook foods\\u2014especially pork\\u2014thoroughly; to refrigerate perishable foods, such as milk, mayonnaise, potato salad,\\nand cream-filled pastry; to always wash hands with warm water and soap before handling food, especially after using the bathroom; to clean utensils thoroughly; to avoid drinking water or eating raw fruit or vegetables when visiting a foreign country; and to eliminate flies and roaches in the home. Peptic ulcers Peptic ulcers\\u2014circumscribed lesions in the mucosal membrane\\u2014can develop in the lower esophagus, stomach, pylorus, duodenum,\\nor jejunum. About 80% of all peptic ulcers are duodenal ulcers, which affect the proximal part of the small intestine. Gastric ulcers, which affect the stomach mucosa, are most\\ncommon in middle-aged and elderly men, especially in chronic users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, or tobacco. Duodenal ulcers usually follow a chronic course, with remissions and exacerbations; 5% to 10% of patients develop\\ncomplications that necessitate surgery. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HOW PEPTIC ULCERS DEVELOP Peptic ulcers can result from factors that increase gastric acid production or from factors that impair mucosal barrier protection. Causes and incidence Researchers recognize three major causes of peptic ulcer disease: infection with Helicobacter pylori (formerly known as Campylobacter pylori ), use of NSAIDs, and pathologic hypersecretory disorders such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. (See How peptic ulcers develop .) How H. pylori produces an ulcer isn't clear. Gastric acid, which was considered a primary cause, now appears mainly to contribute to the P consequences of infection. Ongoing studies should soon unveil the full mechanism of ulcer formation. Salicylates and other NSAIDs encourage ulcer formation by inhibiting the secretion of prostaglandins (the substances that suppress ulceration). Certain illnesses, such as pancreatitis, hepatic disease, Crohn's disease, preexisting gastritis, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, are also known causes. Besides peptic ulcer's main causes, several predisposing factors are acknowledged. They include blood type (gastric ulcers tend to strike people with type A blood; duodenal ulcers tend to afflict people with type O blood) and other genetic factors. Exposure to irritants, such as alcohol, coffee, and tobacco, may contribute by accelerating gastric acid emptying and promoting mucosal breakdown. Ulceration occurs when the acid secretion exceeds the buffering factors.\\nPhysical trauma, emotional stress, and normal aging are additional predisposing conditions. In the United States, about 1.6 million people develop peptic ulcers yearly. Men and women are affected equally, and incidence increases with age. A higher percentage of H. pylori infection occurs in people older than age 50. Complications GI hemorrhage Hypovolemic shock Perforation Obstruction Extension of ulcer into adjacent structures Dumping syndrome Vitamin deficiency Signs and symptoms Heartburn and indigestion usually signal the beginning of\\na gastric ulcer attack. Eating stretches the gastric wall and may cause\\nor, in some cases, relieve pain and feelings of fullness and distention. Other typical effects include weight loss and repeated episodes of massive GI bleeding. Duodenal ulcers produce heartburn, well-localized midepigastric pain (relieved by food), weight gain (because the patient eats to relieve discomfort), and a peculiar sensation of hot water bubbling in the back of the throat. Attacks usually occur about 2 hours after meals, whenever the stomach is empty, or after consumption of orange juice, coffee, aspirin, or alcohol. Exacerbations tend to recur several times per year and then fade into remission. Vomiting and other digestive disturbances are rare. Ulcers may penetrate the pancreas and cause severe back pain. Other complications of peptic ulcers include perforation, hemorrhage, and pyloric obstruction. Ulcers may, on occasion, produce no\\nsymptoms. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirms the presence of an ulcer and permits cytologic studies and biopsy to rule out H. pylori or cancer. Diagnosis may be confirmed by the following tests: Barium swallow or upper GI and small-bowel\\nseries may reveal the presence of the ulcer. This is the initial test performed on a patient whose symptoms aren't severe. Laboratory analysis may detect occult blood in stools. Serologic testing may disclose clinical signs of infection such as an elevated white blood cell count. Carbon 13 ( 13 C) urea breath test results reflect activity of H. pylori. Treatment P Experts recommend treating the patient with two antibiotics and an acid suppressor or stomach-lining protector to eradicate H. pylori .\\nThe patient taking NSAIDs may take a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol)\\nto suppress ulceration (or the patient may take the analog with NSAIDs to prevent ulceration). Histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists\\nor proton pump inhibitors may reduce acid secretion. A coating agent or\\nbismuth may be administered to the patient with a duodenal ulcer to protect the lining. If GI bleeding occurs, emergency treatment begins with passage of a nasogastric (NG) tube to allow for iced saline lavage, possibly containing norepinephrine. Gastroscopy allows visualization of the bleeding site and coagulation by laser or cautery to control bleeding. This type of therapy allows postponement of surgery until the patient's condition stabilizes. Surgery is indicated for perforation, unresponsiveness to conservative treatment, and suspected malignancy. Surgery for peptic ulcers may include: vagotomy and pyloroplasty: severing one or\\nmore branches of the vagus nerve to reduce hydrochloric acid secretion and refashioning the pylorus to create a larger lumen and facilitate gastric emptying distal subtotal gastrectomy (with or without vagotomy): excising the antrum of the stomach, thereby removing the hormonal stimulus of the parietal cells, followed by anastomosis of the rest of the stomach to the duodenum or the jejunum pyloroplasty: surgical enlargement of the pylorus to provide drainage of gastric secretions. Special considerations Management of peptic ulcers requires careful administration of medications, thorough patient teaching, and skillful postoperative care. Watch for adverse reactions to H 2 -receptor antagonists and omeprazole (dizziness, fatigue, rash, and mild diarrhea). Advise any patient who uses antacids, who has a history of cardiac disease, or who follows a sodium-restricted diet to take only those antacids that contain low amounts of sodium. Warn the patient to avoid NSAIDs because they irritate the gastric mucosa. For the same reason, advise the patient to stop smoking and to avoid stressful situations, excessive intake of coffee, and drinking alcoholic beverages during exacerbations of peptic ulcer disease. After gastric surgery: Keep the NG tube patent. If the tube isn't\\nfunctioning, don't reposition it; you might damage the suture line or anastomosis. Notify the surgeon promptly. Monitor intake and output, including NG tube drainage. Check for bowel sounds, and allow the patient nothing by mouth until peristalsis resumes and the NG tube is removed or clamped. Replace fluids and electrolytes. Assess the patient for signs of dehydration, sodium deficiency, and metabolic alkalosis, which may occur secondary to gastric suction. Monitor the patient for possible dumping syndrome (a rapid gastric emptying, causing distention of the duodenum or jejunum produced by a bolus of food). Signs and symptoms of dumping syndrome include diaphoresis, weakness, nausea, flatulence, explosive diarrhea, distention, and palpitations within 30 minutes after a meal. To avoid dumping syndrome, advise the patient to lie down after meals, to drink fluids between meals rather than with meals, to avoid eating large amounts of carbohydrates, and to eat four to six small, high-protein, low-carbohydrate meals during the day. Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory, usually chronic disease that affects the mucosa of the colon. It invariably begins in the rectum and sigmoid colon and commonly extends upward into the entire\\ncolon; it rarely affects the small intestine, except for the terminal ileum. Ulcerative colitis produces edema (leading to mucosal friability)\\nand ulcerations. Severity ranges from a mild, localized disorder to a fulminant disease that may cause a perforated colon, progressing to potentially fatal peritonitis and toxemia. P Causes and incidence Although the etiology of ulcerative colitis is unknown, it's thought to be related to abnormal immune response in the GI tract, possibly associated with food or bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Stress was once thought to be a cause of ulcerative colitis, but studies show that although it isn't a cause, it does increase the severity of the attack. Ulcerative colitis occurs primarily in young adults, especially in women. It's also more prevalent among those of Jewish ancestry, indicating a possible familial tendency. The incidence of the disease is unknown; however, some studies indicate as many as 10 to 15 out of 100,000 persons have the disease. Onset of symptoms seems to peak\\nbetween ages 15 and 30; another peak occurs between ages 50 and 70. Complications Nutritional deficiency Perineal sepsis Anal fissure or fisulta Perirectal abscess Hemorrhage Toxic megacolon Coagulation deficit Signs and symptoms The hallmark of ulcerative colitis is recurrent attacks of bloody diarrhea, in many cases containing pus and mucus, interspersed\\nwith asymptomatic remissions. The intensity of these attacks varies with the extent of inflammation. It isn't uncommon for a patient with ulcerative colitis to have as many as 15 to 20 liquid, bloody stools daily. Other symptoms include spastic rectum and anus, abdominal pain, irritability, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Ulcerative colitis may lead to complications, such as hemorrhage, stricture, or perforation of the colon. Other complications include joint inflammation, ankylosing spondylitis, eye lesions, mouth ulcers, liver disease, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Scientists think that these complications occur when the immune system triggers inflammation in other parts of the body. These disorders are usually mild and disappear when the colitis is treated. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer; children with ulcerative colitis may experience impaired growth and sexual development. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Sigmoidoscopy showing increased mucosal friability, decreased mucosal detail, pinpoint hemorrhages, and thick inflammatory exudate suggests this diagnosis. Biopsy can help confirm it. Colonoscopy may be required to determine the extent of the disease and to evaluate strictured areas and pseudopolyps. (Biopsy would then be done during colonoscopy.) Barium enema can assess the extent of the disease and detect complications, such as strictures and carcinoma. A stool sample should be cultured and analyzed for leukocytes, ova, and parasites. Other supportive laboratory values include decreased serum levels of potassium, magnesium, hemoglobin, and albumin as well as leukocytosis and increased prothrombin time. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate correlates with the severity of the attack. Treatment The goals of treatment are to control inflammation, replace nutritional losses and blood volume, and prevent complications. Supportive treatment includes bed rest, I.V. fluid replacement, and a clear-liquid diet. For patients awaiting surgery or showing signs of dehydration and debilitation from excessive diarrhea, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) rests the intestinal tract, decreases stool volume, and restores positive P nitrogen balance. Blood transfusions or iron supplements may be needed to correct anemia. Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), the drug of choice, is used for its anti- inflammatory and anti-microbial action. Immunomodulators or\\n5- aminosalicylates may be used to decrease the frequency of attacks. Drug therapy to control inflammation includes steroids. Antispasmodics and antidiarrheals are used only in patients whose ulcerative colitis is\\nunder control but who have frequent, loose stools. ALERT Antispasmodics and antidiarrheals may lead to massive dilation of the colon (toxic megacolon) and are generally contraindicated. Surgery is the last resort if the patient has toxic megacolon, fails to respond to drugs and supportive measures, or finds symptoms unbearable. A common surgical technique is proctocolectomy with ileostomy. Another procedure, the ileoanal pull-through, is being performed in more cases. This procedure entails performing a total proctocolectomy and mucosal stripping, creating a pouch from the terminal ileum, and anastomosing the pouch to the anal canal. A temporary ileostomy is created to divert stool and allow the rectal anastomosis to heal. The ileostomy is closed in 2 to 3 months, and the patient can then evacuate stool rectally. This procedure removes all the potentially malignant epithelia of the rectum and colon. Total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis isn't as common because of its mortality rate (2% to 5%). This procedure removes the entire colon and anastomoses the terminal ileum to the rectum; it requires observation of the remaining rectal stump for any signs of cancer or colitis. Pouch ileostomy (Kock pouch or continent ileostomy), in which the surgeon creates a pouch from a small loop of the terminal ileum and a nipple valve from the distal ileum, may be an option. The resulting stoma opens just above the pubic hairline and the pouch is emptied periodically through a catheter inserted in the stoma. In ulcerative colitis, a colectomy may be performed after 10 years of active disease because of the increased incidence of colon cancer in these cases. Performing a partial colectomy to prevent colon cancer is controversial. Special considerations Patient care includes close monitoring for changes in status. Accurately record intake and output, particularly the frequency and volume of stools. Watch for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, especially signs and symptoms of\\nhypokalemia (muscle weakness and paresthesia) and hypernatremia (tachycardia, flushed skin, fever, and dry tongue). Monitor hemoglobin level and hematocrit, and give blood transfusions as ordered. Provide good mouth care for the patient who's allowed nothing by mouth. After each bowel movement, thoroughly clean the skin around the rectum. Provide an air mattress or sheepskin to help prevent skin breakdown. Administer medications, as ordered. Watch for adverse effects of prolonged corticosteroid therapy (moon face, hirsutism, edema, and gastric irritation). Be aware that corticosteroid therapy may mask infection. If the patient needs TPN, change dressings\\nas ordered, assess for inflammation at the insertion site, and check capillary blood glucose levels every 4 to 6 hours. Take precautionary measures if the patient\\nis prone to bleeding. Watch closely for signs of complications, such as\\na perforated colon and peritonitis (fever, severe abdominal pain, abdominal rigidity and tenderness, and cool, clammy skin) and toxic megacolon (abdominal distention and decreased bowel sounds). For the patient requiring surgery: Carefully prepare the patient for surgery, and inform him about ileostomy. Do a bowel preparation, as ordered. After surgery, provide meticulous supportive care and continue teaching correct stoma care. Keep the nasogastric tube patent. After removal of the tube, provide a clear-liquid diet and gradually advance to a low-residue diet, as P tolerated. After a proctocolectomy and ileostomy, teach good stoma care. Wash the skin around the stoma with soapy water and dry it thoroughly. Apply karaya gum around the stoma's base to avoid\\nirritation, and make a watertight seal. Attach the pouch over the karaya ring. Cut an opening in the ring to fit over the stoma, and secure the pouch to the skin. Empty the pouch when it's one-third full. Encourage the patient to report to physician stoma color changes or purulent drainage. After a pouch ileostomy, uncork the catheter every hour to allow contents to drain. After 10 to 14 days, gradually increase the length of time the catheter is left corked until it can be opened every 3 hours. Then remove the catheter and reinsert it\\nevery 3 to 4 hours for drainage. Teach the patient how to insert the catheter and how to take care of the stoma. Encourage the patient to have regular physical examinations. Necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is characterized by diffuse or patchy intestinal necrosis, accompanied by sepsis in about one-third of cases. Sepsis usually involves Escherichia coli, Clostridia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella. Initially, necrosis is localized, occurring anywhere along the intestine, but usually in the ileum, ascending colon, or rectosigmoid. If diffuse bleeding occurs, NEC usually results in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Causes and incidence The exact cause of NEC is unknown. Suggested predisposing\\nfactors include birth asphyxia, postnatal hypotension, respiratory distress, hypothermia, umbilical vessel catheterization, exchange transfusion, or patent ductus arteriosus. NEC may also be a response to significant prenatal stress, such as premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa, maternal sepsis, toxemia of pregnancy, or breech or cesarean birth. NEC may develop when the infant suffers perinatal hypoxemia due to shunting of blood from the gut to more vital organs. Subsequent mucosal ischemia provides an ideal medium for bacterial growth. Hypertonic formula may increase bacterial activity because\\u2014unlike maternal breast milk\\u2014it doesn't provide protective immunologic activity and it contributes to the production of hydrogen gas. As the bowel swells and breaks down, gas-forming bacteria invade damaged areas, producing free air in the intestinal wall. This may result in fatal perforation and peritonitis. NEC usually occurs in premature infants (less than 34 weeks' gestation) and those of low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams).\\nNEC is more common in some geographic areas, possibly due to the higher\\nincidence and survival of premature neonates and neonates who have low birth weights in these areas. NEC also may occur in infants in a nursery\\nwhere an outbreak has occurred, suggesting an infectious cause. Although the outcome is improved with aggressive, early treatment, it's a\\nserious disease with a death rate of 25%. Complications Perforation Mechanical and functional abnormalities of the intestine Signs and symptoms Neonates who have suffered from perinatal hypoxemia have the potential for developing NEC. A distended (especially tense or rigid) abdomen with gastric retention is the earliest and most common sign of oncoming NEC, which usually appears 1 to 10 days after birth. Other clinical features are increasing residual gastric contents (which may contain bile), bile-stained vomitus, and occult blood in the stool. About 25% of patients have bloody diarrhea. A red or shiny, taut abdomen\\nmay indicate peritonitis. Nonspecific signs and symptoms include thermal instability, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, jaundice, and DIC. The major complication is perforation, which requires surgery. Recurrence of NEC and mechanical and functional abnormalities of the intestine, especially\\nstricture, are P the usual cause of residual intestinal malfunction in any infant who survives acute NEC; this complication may develop as late\\nas 3 months postoperatively. Diagnosis Successful treatment of NEC relies on early recognition. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Abdominal X-rays confirm the diagnosis, showing nonspecific intestinal dilation and, in later stages of NEC, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (gas or air in the intestinal\\nwall). Blood studies show several abnormalities. Platelet count may fall below 50,000/\\u00b5l. Serum sodium levels are decreased, and arterial blood gas levels indicate metabolic acidosis (a result of sepsis). Infection-induced red blood cell breakdown elevates bilirubin levels. Blood and stool cultures identify the infecting organism, clotting studies and the hemoglobin level reveal associated DIC, and the\\nguaiac test detects occult blood in the stool. Treatment The first signs of NEC necessitate removal of the umbilical catheter (arterial or venous) and discontinuation of oral intake for 7 to 10 days to rest the injured bowel. I.V. fluids, including total parenteral nutrition, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and nutrition during this time; passage of a nasogastric (NG) tube aids bowel decompression. If coagulation studies indicate a need for transfusion, the infant usually receives dextran to promote hemodilution, increase mesenteric blood flow, and reduce platelet aggregation. Antibiotic therapy consists of parenteral agents\\u2014administered through an NG tube, if necessary\\u2014to suppress bacterial flora and prevent bowel perforation. Anteroposterior and lateral X-rays are repeated to monitor disease progression. Surgery is indicated if the patient shows any of these signs or symptoms: signs of perforation (free intraperitoneal air on X-ray or symptoms of peritonitis), respiratory insufficiency (caused by severe abdominal distention), progressive and intractable acidosis, or DIC. Surgery removes all necrotic and acutely inflamed bowel and creates\\na temporary colostomy or ileostomy. At least 12\\u2033 (30.5 cm) of bowel must remain or the infant may suffer from malabsorption or chronic vitamin B 12 deficiency. Special considerations ALERT Be alert for signs or symptoms of gastric distention and perforation: apnea, cardiovascular shock, sudden drop in temperature, bradycardia, sudden listlessness, rag-doll limpness, increasing abdominal tenderness, edema, erythema, or involuntary abdominal rigidity. To avoid perforating the bowel, don't take rectal temperatures. Prevent cross-contamination by disposing of soiled diapers properly and washing your hands after diaper changes. After surgery, the infant needs mechanical ventilation. Gently suction secretions, and assess his breathing often. Replace fluids lost through NG tube and stoma drainage. Include drainage losses in output records. Weigh the infant daily. A daily weight gain of 10 to 20 g indicates a good response to therapy. An infant with a temporary colostomy or ileostomy needs special care. Explain to the parents what a colostomy or\\nileostomy is and why it's necessary. Encourage them to participate in their infant's physical care after his condition is no longer critical. Because of the infant's small abdomen, the\\nsuture line is near the stoma; as a result, keeping the suture line clean can be a problem. Good skin care is essential because the immature\\ninfant's skin is fragile and vulnerable to excoriation and the active enzymes in bowel secretions are corrosive. Improvise premature-sized colostomy bags from urine collection bags, medicine cups, or condoms. Karaya gum is helpful in making a seal. Watch for wound disruption, infection, and excoriation\\u2014potential dangers because of severe catabolism. Watch for intestinal malfunction from stricture or short-gut syndrome. Such complications usually develop 1 month after the infant resumes normal feedings. PREVENTION Encourage mothers to breast-feed because breast milk contains live macrophages that fight infection and has a low pH that inhibits the growth of many organisms. Also, colostrum\\u2014fluid secreted before the milk\\u2014contains high concentrations of\\nimmunoglobulin A, which directly protects the gut from infection and which the neonate lacks for several days postpartum. Tell mothers that they may refrigerate their milk for 48 hours but shouldn't freeze or heat it because this destroys antibodies. Tell them to use plastic\\u2014not glass\\u2014containers because leukocytes adhere to glass. Crohn's disease Crohn's disease, also known as regional enteritis and granulomatous colitis, is an inflammation of any part of the GI tract (usually the proximal portion of the colon or, less commonly, the terminal ileum) that extends\\nthrough all layers of the intestinal wall. It may also involve regional\\nlymph nodes and the mesentery. Granulomas are usually surrounded by normal mucosa; when these lesions are present in multiples, they're commonly referred to as skip lesions. The surface of the inflamed GI tract usually has a cobblestone appearance, which is different from alternating areas of inflammation and fissure crevices. Causes and incidence In Crohn's disease, lacteal blockage in the intestinal wall leads to edema and, eventually, inflammation, ulceration, and stenosis. Abscesses and fistulas may also occur. Although the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, autoimmune and genetic factors are thought to play a role. Up to 5% of those with the disease have one or P more affected relatives; Jewish ancestry is also a risk factor. However,\\na pattern of Mendelian inheritance hasn't been identified. THE \\u201cSTRING SIGN\\u201d The characteristic \\u201cstring sign\\u201d (marked narrowing of the bowel), resulting from inflammatory disease and scarring, strengthens the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The incidence of Crohn's disease has risen steadily over the past 50 years; it now affects 7 out of every 100,000 people. Crohn's\\ndisease is most prevalent in adults ages 20 to 40. It's two to three times more common in those of Jewish ancestry and least common in blacks. Complications Anal fistula Perineal abscess Intestinal obstruction Nutritional deficiency Peritonitis (rare) Signs and symptoms Clinical effects may be mild and nonspecific initially; they vary according to the location and extent of the lesion. Acute inflammatory signs and symptoms mimic appendicitis and include steady, colicky pain in the right lower quadrant, cramping, tenderness, flatulence, nausea, fever, and diarrhea. Bleeding may occur and, although usually mild, may be massive. Bloody stools may also occur. Chronic symptoms, which are more typical of the disease, are more persistent and less severe; they include diarrhea (four to six stools per day) with pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant, steatorrhea (excess fat in feces), marked weight loss and, rarely, clubbing of fingers. The patient may complain of weakness and fatigue. Complications include intestinal obstruction, fistula formation between the small bowel and the bladder, perianal and perirectal abscesses and fistulas, intra-abdominal abscesses, and perforation. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Barium enema showing the string sign\\n(segments of stricture separated by normal bowel) supports a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. (See The \\u201cstring sign.\\u201d ) Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy may show patchy areas of inflammation, thus helping to rule out ulcerative colitis. However, biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis. Laboratory findings commonly indicate increased white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and a decreased hemoglobin level. Treatment To control the inflammatory process, medications, such as\\n5- aminosalicylate and sulfasalazine, may be prescribed. Corticosteroids and immunomodulators, such as azathioprine (Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol), may be prescribed if 5-aminosalicylate isn't effective or in patients with severe Crohn's disease. In debilitated P patients, therapy includes total parenteral nutrition to maintain nutritional status while resting the bowel. If abscesses or fistulas occur, antibiotics may be prescribed. Infliximab (Remicade), an antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (an immune chemical that promotes inflammation), may also be prescribed. Effective treatment requires important changes in lifestyle: physical rest, restricted diet (specific foods vary from person to person), vitamin B 12 injections and supplements, and elimination of dairy products for lactose intolerance. Surgery may be necessary to correct bowel perforation, massive hemorrhage, fistulas, or acute intestinal obstruction. Colectomy\\nwith ileostomy is necessary in many patients with extensive disease of the large intestine and rectum. Special considerations Although treatment is based largely on symptoms, you should monitor the patient's status carefully for signs of worsening. Record fluid intake and output (including the amount of stool), and weigh the patient daily. Watch for dehydration\\nand maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Be alert for signs of intestinal bleeding (bloody stools); check stools daily for occult blood. Check hemoglobin level and hematocrit regularly. Give iron supplements and blood transfusions, as ordered. Provide good patient hygiene and mouth care if the patient is restricted to nothing by mouth. After each bowel movement, give good skin care. Always keep a clean, covered bedpan within the patient's reach. Ventilate the room to eliminate odors. Observe the patient for fever and pain or pneumaturia, which may signal bladder fistula. Abdominal pain and distention and fever may indicate intestinal obstruction. Watch for stools from the vagina and an enterovaginal fistula. Before ileostomy, arrange for a visit by an enterostomal therapist. After surgery, frequently check the patient's I.V. line and NG tube for proper functioning. Monitor his vital signs and fluid intake and output. Watch for wound infection. Provide meticulous stoma care, and teach it to the patient and his family. Realize that ileostomy changes the patient's body image, so offer reassurance and emotional support. Stress the need for a severely restricted diet and bed rest, which may be trying, particularly for the young patient. Encourage him to try to reduce tension. If stress is clearly an\\naggravating factor, refer him for counseling. Refer the patient to a support group such as the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is an acute inflammation and necrosis of the small and large intestines, which usually affects the mucosa but may extend into submucosa and, rarely, other layers. Marked by severe diarrhea, this rare condition is generally fatal in 1 to 7 days due to severe dehydration and toxicity, peritonitis, or perforation. Causes and incidence The exact cause of pseudomembranous enterocolitis is unknown; however, Clostridium difficile is thought to produce a toxin that may play a role in its development. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis has occurred postoperatively in debilitated patients who undergo abdominal surgery and in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Whatever the cause, necrotic mucosa is replaced by a pseudomembrane filled with staphylococci, leukocytes, mucus, fibrin, and inflammatory cells. Incidence of antibiotic-related diarrhea varies from 5% to 39%, depending on the antibiotic. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis complicates 10% of these cases. PEDIATRIC TIP Ampicillin is the most common antibiotic associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis in children. P Complications Severe dehydration Electrolyte imbalance Hypotension Shock Colonic perforation Peritonitis Signs and symptoms Pseudomembranous enterocolitis begins suddenly with copious watery or bloody diarrhea that may contain pus or mucus, abdominal pain, and fever. Serious complications, including severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, shock, and colonic perforation, may occur in this disorder. Diagnosis Diagnosis is difficult in many cases because of the abrupt onset of enterocolitis and the emergency situation it creates, so\\nconsideration of patient history is essential. A rectal biopsy through sigmoidoscopy confirms pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Stool cultures can identify C. difficile. Treatment A patient receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy must discontinue antibiotics at once. Effective treatment usually includes metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is usually given for severe or resistant cases. A patient with mild pseudomembranous enterocolitis may receive anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine, to bind the toxin\\nproduced by C. difficile . Supportive treatment must maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and combat hypotension and shock with pressors, such as dopamine and levarterenol. Special considerations Careful observation for signs of worsening is essential. Monitor the patient's vital signs, skin color, and level of consciousness. Immediately report signs of shock. Record fluid intake and output, including fluid lost in stools. Watch for dehydration (poor skin turgor, sunken eyes, and decreased urine output). Check serum electrolyte levels daily, and watch for clinical signs of hypokalemia, especially malaise, and a weak,\\nrapid, irregular pulse. PREVENTION Antibiotics should be used only as prescribed by physicians. In addition, studies show the use of probiotics along with antibiotics may help prevent pseudomembranous colitis. Irritable bowel syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), also called spastic colon and spastic colitis, is a common condition marked by chronic or periodic diarrhea, alternating with constipation, and accompanied by straining and abdominal cramps. The prognosis is good. Supportive treatment or avoidance of a known irritant usually relieves symptoms. Causes and incidence This functional disorder is generally associated with psychological stress; however, it may result from physical factors, such\\nas diverticular disease, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, ingestion of irritants (coffee, raw fruits or vegetables), lactose intolerance, laxative abuse, food poisoning, or colon cancer. Some patients may experience a disturbance in the movement of the intestine or a lower tolerance for stretching and movement of the intestine. IBS affects 10% to 20% of U.S. residents and has a yearly\\nincidence rate of 1% to 2%. The condition occurs most commonly in women\\nages 20 to P 30. Complications Diverticulitis Colon cancer (higher incidence) Signs and symptoms IBS characteristically produces lower abdominal pain (usually relieved by defecation or passage of gas) and diarrhea that typically occurs during the day. These symptoms alternate with constipation or normal bowel function. Stools are commonly small and contain visible mucus. Dyspepsia and abdominal distention may occur. Symptoms of IBS are two to three times more common in women than in men, with women comprising 80% of patients with a more severe form of the disorder. Diagnosis Diagnosis of IBS requires a careful history to determine contributing psychological factors such as a recent stressful life change. Diagnosis must also rule out other disorders, such as amebiasis, diverticulitis, colon cancer, and lactose intolerance. Appropriate diagnostic procedures include sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, barium enema, rectal biopsy, and stool examination for blood, parasites, and bacteria. Treatment Therapy aims to relieve symptoms and includes counseling to help the patient understand the relationship between stress and his illness. Strict dietary restrictions aren't beneficial, but food irritants should be investigated and the patient should be instructed to\\navoid them. Rest and heat applied to the abdomen are helpful, as is judicious use of sedatives and antispasmodics. However, with chronic use, the patient may become dependent on these drugs. If the cause of IBS is chronic laxative abuse, bowel training may help correct the condition. Tegaserod maleate (Zelnorm) may be prescribed for the patient\\nwith constipationpredominant IBS and no heart problems. Special considerations Because the patient with IBS isn't hospitalized, focus your care on patient teaching. Tell the patient to avoid irritating foods, and encourage him to develop regular bowel habits. Help the patient deal with stress, and warn against dependence on sedatives or antispasmodics. Encourage regular checkups because IBS is associated with a higher- than-normal incidence of diverticulitis and colon cancer. For patients older than age 40, emphasize the need for an annual sigmoidoscopy and rectal examination. Celiac disease Celiac disease (also known as idiopathic steatorrhea, nontropical sprue, gluten enteropathy, and celiac sprue )\\nis characterized by poor food absorption and intolerance of gluten, a protein in wheat and wheat products. Malabsorption in the small bowel results from atrophy of the villi and a decrease in the activity and amount of enzymes in the surface epithelium. The prognosis is good with treatment (eliminating gluten from the patient's diet), but residual bowel changes may persist in adults. Causes and incidence In celiac disease, an intramucosal enzyme defect produces\\nan inability to digest gluten. Resulting tissue toxicity produces rapid\\ncell turnover, increases epithelial lymphocytes, and damages surface epithelium of the small bowel. Celiac disease affects 1 of every 133 people in the United States and results from environmental factors and a genetic predisposition, but the exact mechanism is unknown. A strong association\\nexists between the P disease and two human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, DR3 and DQw2. It may also be autoimmune in nature. It affects twice as many women and girls as men and boys and occurs more commonly among relatives, especially siblings. This disease primarily affects whites and those of European ancestry. Many diseases and conditions are associated with celiac disease, including: anemia lactose intolerance skin disorders such as dermatitis herpetiformis (a burning, itching, blistering rash) type 1 diabetes mellitus thyroid disease Down syndrome unexplained infertility or miscarriage osteoporosis or osteopenia autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Complications Anemia from malabsorption Syncope, heart failure, and angina from anemia Bleeding disorders from vitamin K deficiency Intestinal lymphoma (higher incidence) Signs and symptoms Celiac disease produces clinical effects on many body systems: GI symptoms include recurrent attacks of diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal distention due to flatulence, stomach cramps, weakness, anorexia and, occasionally, increased appetite without\\nweight gain. Atrophy of intestinal villi leads to malabsorption of fat, carbohydrates, and protein as well as loss of calories, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, and K), calcium, and essential minerals and electrolytes. In adults, celiac disease produces multiple nonspecific ulcers in the small bowel, which may perforate or bleed. Hematologic effects include normochromic, hypochromic, or macrocytic anemia due to poor absorption of folate, iron, and vitamin B12 and to hypoprothrombinemia from jejunal loss of vitamin K. Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, tetany, and bone pain (especially in the lower back, rib cage, and pelvis) are some of the musculoskeletal symptoms of celiac disease. These signs and symptoms are due to calcium loss and vitamin D deficiency, which weakens\\nthe skeleton, causing rickets in children and compression fractures in adults. Neurologic effects may include peripheral neuropathy, seizures, or paresthesia. Dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, and acne rosacea are some of the dermatologic effects of celiac disease. Deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids may cause generalized fine, sparse, prematurely gray hair; brittle nails; and localized hyperpigmentation on the face, lips, or mucosa. Endocrine symptoms include amenorrhea, hypometabolism and, possibly, with severe malabsorption, adrenocortical insufficiency. Psychosocial effects include mood changes and irritability. Symptoms may develop during the first year of life, when gluten is introduced into the child's diet as cereal. Clinical effects may disappear during adolescence and reappear in adulthood. One theory proposes that the age at which symptoms first appear depends on the strength of the genetic factor: A strong factor produces symptoms during\\nthe child's first 4 years; a weak factor, in late childhood or adulthood. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Histologic changes seen on small-bowel biopsy specimens obtained with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy\\nconfirm the diagnosis: a mosaic pattern of alternating flat and bumpy areas on the bowel surface due to an almost total absence of villi and an irregular, blunt, and disorganized network of blood vessels. These changes appear most prominently in the jejunum. An elevated alkaline phosphatase level may indicate bone loss, which is commonly experienced before diagnosis. Low cholesterol and albumin levels may reflect malabsorption and malnutrition. Mildly elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood clotting may also be noted as well as anemia. Antibody blood tests useful in screening for celiac disease include IgA antiendomysial antibody (AEA), anti-tissue transglutaminase (+TGA), antigliadin (IgA and IgG), and total serum IgA.\\nCombined, these antibodies provide a sensitive and specific indicator for the presence of celiac disease. Treatment Treatment requires elimination of gluten from the patient's diet for life. Even with this exclusion, a full return to normal absorption and bowel histology may not occur for months or may never occur. Supportive treatment may include supplemental iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid; reversal of electrolyte imbalance (by I.V. infusion, if necessary); I.V. fluid replacement for dehydration; corticosteroids to treat accompanying adrenal insufficiency; and vitamin\\nK for hypoprothrombinemia. Special considerations Explain the necessity of a gluten-free diet to the patient (and to his parents, if the patient is a child). Advise eliminating wheat, barley, rye, and oats as well as foods made from these grains, such as breads and baked goods; suggest substituting corn or rice. Consult a dietitian for nutritional instruction on a gluten-free diet. Depending on individual P tolerance, the diet initially consists of proteins and gradually expands to include other foods. Assess the patient's acceptance and understanding of the disease, and encourage regular reevaluation. ALERT Because many foods contain hidden sources of gluten, food labels must be read carefully. Observe the patient's nutritional status and progress by daily calorie counts and weight checks. Also, evaluate his tolerance to new foods. In the early stages, offer small, frequent meals to counteract anorexia. Assess the patient's fluid status: record intake, urine output, and number of stools (may exceed 10 per day). Watch for signs of dehydration, such as dry skin and mucous membranes, and poor skin turgor. Check serum electrolyte levels. Watch for signs of hypokalemia (weakness, lethargy, rapid pulse, nausea, and diarrhea) and low calcium levels (impaired blood clotting, muscle twitching, and tetany). Monitor prothrombin time, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit. Protect the patient from bleeding and bruising. Use the Z-track method to give iron I.M. If the patient can tolerate oral iron, give it between meals, when absorption is best. Dilute oral iron preparations, and give them through a straw to prevent staining teeth. Protect the patient with osteomalacia from injury by keeping the bed side rails up and assisting with ambulation, as necessary. Advise the patient to contact the Gluten Intolerance Group or the Associated Celiac Disease Foundation for information and support. Diverticular disease In diverticular disease, bulging pouches (diverticula) in\\nthe GI wall push the mucosal lining through the surrounding muscle. The\\nmost common site for diverticula is in the sigmoid colon, but they may develop anywhere, from the proximal end of the pharynx to the anus. Other typical sites are the duodenum, near the pancreatic border or the ampulla of Vater, and the jejunum. Diverticular disease of the stomach is rare and is usually a precursor of peptic or neoplastic disease. Diverticular disease of the ileum (Meckel's diverticulum) is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract. (See Meckel's diverticulum. ) MECKEL'S DIVERTICULUM In Meckel's diverticulum, a congenital abnormality\\u2014a blind tube, like the appendix\\u2014opens into the distal ileum near the ileocecal valve. This disorder results from failure of the intra-abdominal portion of the yolk sac to close completely during fetal\\ndevelopment. It occurs in 2% of the population, mostly in males. Uncomplicated Meckel's diverticulum produces no symptoms,\\nbut complications cause abdominal pain, especially around the umbilicus, and dark red melena or hematochezia. The lining of the diverticulum is gastric mucosa. This disorder may lead to peptic ulceration, perforation, and peritonitis and may resemble acute appendicitis. Meckel's diverticulum also may cause bowel obstruction when a fibrous band that connects the diverticulum to the abdominal wall, the mesentery, or other structures snares a loop of the intestine.\\nThis may cause intussusception into the diverticulum or volvulus near the diverticular attachment to the back of the umbilicus or another intra-abdominal structure. Meckel's diverticulum should be considered in\\ncases of GI obstruction or hemorrhage, especially when routine GI X-rays are negative. Treatment consists of surgical resection of the inflamed bowel and antibiotic therapy if infection is present. P Diverticular disease has two clinical forms. In diverticulosis, diverticula are present but don't cause symptoms. In diverticulitis, diverticula are inflamed and may cause potentially fatal obstruction, infection, or hemorrhage. Causes and incidence In diverticulitis, retained undigested food mixed with bacteria accumulates in the diverticular sac, forming a hard mass (fecalith). This substance cuts off the blood supply to the thin walls of the sac, making them more susceptible to attack by colonic bacteria. Inflammation follows, possibly leading to perforation, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, or hemorrhage. Occasionally, the inflamed colon segment may produce a fistula by adhering to the bladder or other organs. Diverticula probably result from high intraluminal pressure on areas of weakness in the GI wall, where blood vessels enter.\\nDiet may also be a contributing factor because insufficient fiber reduces fecal residue, narrows the bowel lumen, and leads to higher intra-abdominal pressure during defecation. The prevalence of diverticulosis in Western industrialized nations, where processing removes much of the roughage from foods, supports this theory. Diverticular disease is most prevalent in those older than age 40. The incidence of diverticular disease increases with age,\\nbut 20% of patients are younger than age 50. Right-sided diverticulitis\\nis most common in Asians, accounting for 75% of cases in that ethnic group. Left-sided diverticulitis is more common in Western countries, where it accounts for 70% of cases. ELDER TIP About 50% of older adults develop diverticulosis. In elderly patients, a rare complication of diverticulosis (without diverticulitis) is hemorrhage from colonic diverticula. Such hemorrhage is usually mild to moderate and easily controlled, but may occasionally be massive and life-threatening. Complications Rectal hemorrhage Portal pyremia Fistula Signs and symptoms Diverticulosis usually produces no symptoms but may cause\\nrecurrent left lower quadrant pain, which is commonly accompanied by alternating constipation and diarrhea and is relieved by defecation or the passage of flatus. Symptoms resemble irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and suggest that both disorders may coexist. Mild diverticulitis produces moderate left lower abdominal pain, mild nausea, gas, irregular bowel habits, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis. In severe diverticulitis, the diverticula can rupture and produce abscesses or peritonitis, which occurs in up to 20% of such patients. Symptoms of rupture include abdominal rigidity and left lower quadrant pain. Peritonitis follows release of fecal material from the rupture site and causes signs of sepsis and shock (high fever, chills, and hypotension). Rupture of the diverticulum near a vessel may cause microscopic or massive hemorrhage, depending on the vessel's size. Chronic diverticulitis may cause fibrosis and adhesions that narrow the bowel's lumen and lead to bowel obstruction. Symptoms of\\nincomplete obstruction are constipation, ribbonlike stools, intermittent diarrhea, and abdominal distention. Increasing obstruction causes abdominal rigidity and pain, diminishing or absent bowel sounds, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis In many cases, diverticular disease produces no symptoms and is found during an upper GI series performed as part of a differential diagnosis. Tests showing diverticular disease include computed tomography (reveals areas of inflammation), colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and barium enema. P CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A barium study confirms the diagnosis. An upper GI series confirms or rules out diverticulosis of the esophagus and upper bowel; a barium enema confirms or rules out diverticulosis of the lower bowel. Barium-filled diverticula can be single, multiple, or clustered and may have a wide or narrow mouth. Barium outlines\\u2014but doesn't fill\\u2014 diverticula blocked by impacted feces. In patients with acute diverticulitis, a barium enema may rupture the bowel, so this procedure requires caution. If IBS accompanies diverticular disease, X-rays may reveal colonic spasm. Biopsy rules out cancer; however, a colonoscopic biopsy isn't recommended during acute diverticular disease because of the strenuous bowel preparation it requires. Blood studies may show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in diverticulitis, especially if\\nthe diverticula are infected. Treatment Diverticulosis that doesn't produce symptoms generally doesn't necessitate treatment. Intestinal diverticulosis with pain, mild\\nGI distress, constipation, or difficult defecation may respond to a liquid or bland diet, stool softeners, and occasional doses of mineral oil. These measures relieve symptoms, minimize irritation, and lessen the risk of progression to diverticulitis. After pain subsides, patients\\nalso benefit from a high-residue diet and bulk medication such as psyllium. Treatment of mild diverticulitis without signs of perforation must prevent constipation and combat infection. It may include bed rest, a liquid diet, stool softeners, and a broad-spectrum antibiotic. If diverticulitis is refractory to medical treatment, a colon resection is necessary to remove the involved segment. Perforation, peritonitis, obstruction, or fistula that accompanies diverticulitis may require a temporary colostomy to drain abscesses and rest the colon, followed by later reanastomosis 6 weeks to 3 months after initial surgery. Special considerations Management of uncomplicated diverticulosis chiefly involves thorough patient education about fiber and dietary habits. Make sure that the patient understands the\\nimportance of dietary fiber and the harmful effects of constipation and\\nstraining during defecation. Encourage increased intake of foods high in indigestible fiber, including fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain bread, and wheat or bran cereals. Warn that a high-fiber diet may temporarily cause flatulence and discomfort. Advise the patient to relieve constipation with stool softeners or bulk-forming cathartics. However, caution the patient against taking bulk-forming cathartics without plenty of water; if swallowed dry, they may absorb enough moisture in the mouth and throat to swell and obstruct the esophagus or trachea. If the patient with diverticular disease is hospitalized, observe his stools carefully for frequency, color, and consistency, and keep accurate pulse and temperature charts because changes may signal developing inflammation or complications. After surgery to resect the colon: Watch for signs of infection. Provide meticulous wound care because perforation may already have infected the area. Check drain sites frequently for signs of infection (purulent drainage or foul odor) or fecal drainage. Change dressings as necessary. Encourage coughing and deep breathing to prevent atelectasis. Watch for signs of postoperative bleeding (hypotension and decreased hemoglobin level and hematocrit). Record intake and output accurately. Keep the nasogastric tube patent. Teach ostomy care as needed. Arrange for a visit by an enterostomal therapist. P Appendicitis Appendicitis is inflammation of the vermiform appendix due to an obstruction. Causes and incidence Appendicitis probably results from an obstruction of the appendiceal lumen caused by a fecal mass, stricture, barium ingestion, or viral infection. This obstruction sets off an inflammatory process that can lead to infection, thrombosis, necrosis, and perforation. If the appendix ruptures or perforates, the infected contents spill into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis, the most common and most perilous complication of appendicitis. Appendicitis occurs more commonly in men than in women, with a peak incidence in the late teens and early 20s. About 250,000 cases are reported annually. It's a common cause of surgical emergency in children, with 4 appendectomies per 1,000 admissions for appendicitis annually in the United States. Signs and symptoms Typically, appendicitis begins with generalized or localized abdominal pain in the right upper abdomen, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting (rarely profuse). Pain eventually localizes in the right lower abdomen (McBurney's point) with abdominal \\u201cboardlike\\u201d rigidity, retractive respirations, increasing tenderness, increasingly severe abdominal spasms and, almost invariably, rebound tenderness. (Rebound tenderness on the opposite side of the abdomen suggests peritoneal inflammation.) Later signs and symptoms include constipation or diarrhea, slight fever, and tachycardia. The patient may walk bent over or lie with his right knee flexed to reduce pain. ALERT Sudden cessation of abdominal pain indicates perforation or infarction of the appendix. Complications Perforation Peritonitis Appendiceal abscess Pyelophlebitis Diagnosis Diagnosis of appendicitis is based on physical findings and characteristic clinical symptoms. Supportive findings include a temperature of 99\\u00b0 to 102\\u00b0 F (37.2\\u00b0 to 38.9\\u00b0 C) and a moderately elevated white blood cell count (12,000 to 15,000/mcl), with increased immature cells. Diagnosis must rule out illnesses with similar symptoms: gastritis, gastroenteritis, ileitis, colitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, renal colic, bladder infection, ovarian cyst, and uterine disease. It may be strongly suspected based on abdominal sonography or computed tomography scan. Appendicitis can be confirmed by exploratory laparoscopy. Treatment Appendectomy is the only effective treatment. Laparoscopic appendectomies decrease the recovery time and thus the hospital stay. If peritonitis develops, treatment involves GI intubation, parenteral replacement of fluids and electrolytes, and administration of antibiotics. Special considerations If appendicitis is suspected, or during preparation for appendectomy: Administer I.V. fluids to prevent dehydration. Never administer cathartics or enemas, which may rupture the appendix. Give the patient nothing by mouth, and administer analgesics judiciously because they may mask symptoms. To lessen pain, place the patient in Fowler's position. ALERT P Never apply heat to the right lower abdomen; this may cause the appendix to rupture. An ice bag may be used for pain relief. After appendectomy: Monitor the patient's vital signs and intake and output. Give analgesics, as ordered. Encourage the patient to cough, breathe deeply, and turn frequently to prevent pulmonary complications. Document bowel sounds, passing of flatus, and bowel movements. In a patient whose nausea and abdominal rigidity have subsided, these signs indicate readiness to resume oral fluids. Watch closely for possible surgical complications. Continuing pain and fever may signal an abscess. The complaint that \\u201csomething gave way\\u201d may mean wound dehiscence. If an abscess or peritonitis develops, incision and drainage may be necessary.\\nFrequently assess the dressing for wound drainage. Help the patient ambulate as soon as possible after surgery. In appendicitis complicated by peritonitis, a nasogastric tube may be needed to decompress the stomach and reduce nausea and vomiting. If so, record drainage and provide mouth\\nand nose care. Peritonitis Peritonitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the visceral organs. Inflammation may extend throughout the peritoneum or may be localized as an abscess. Peritonitis commonly decreases intestinal motility and causes intestinal distention with gas. Mortality\\nis 10%, with death usually a result of bowel obstruction; mortality was\\nmuch higher before the introduction of antibiotics. Causes and incidence Although the GI tract normally contains bacteria, the peritoneum is sterile. When bacteria invade the peritoneum due to inflammation and perforation of the GI tract, peritonitis results. Bacterial invasion of the peritoneum typically results from appendicitis, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, volvulus, strangulated obstruction, abdominal neoplasm, or a stab wound.\\nPeritonitis may also occur following chemical inflammation, as in the rupture of a fallopian or ovarian tube or the bladder, perforation of a gastric ulcer, or released pancreatic enzymes. It may also be associated\\nwith peritoneal dialysis. In chemical and bacterial inflammation, accumulated fluids containing protein and electrolytes make the transparent peritoneum opaque, red, inflamed, and edematous. Because the peritoneal cavity is so resistant to contamination, infection is commonly localized\\nas an abscess instead of disseminated as a generalized infection. Complications Abscess Septicemia Respiratory compromise Bowel obstruction Shock Signs and symptoms The key symptom of peritonitis is sudden, severe, and diffuse abdominal pain that tends to intensify and localize in the area of the underlying disorder. For instance, if appendicitis causes the rupture, pain eventually localizes in the right lower quadrant. Many patients display weakness, pallor, excessive sweating, and cold skin as a\\nresult of excessive loss of fluid, electrolytes, and protein into the abdominal cavity. Decreased intestinal motility and paralytic ileus result from the effect of bacterial toxins on the intestinal muscles. Intestinal obstruction causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal rigidity. Other clinical characteristics include hypotension, tachycardia, signs and symptoms of dehydration (oliguria, thirst, dry swollen tongue, and P pinched skin), an acutely tender abdomen associated with rebound tenderness, temperature of 103\\u00b0 F (39.4\\u00b0 C) or higher, and hypokalemia. Inflammation of the diaphragmatic peritoneum may cause shoulder pain and hiccups. Abdominal distention and resulting upward displacement of the diaphragm may decrease respiratory capacity. Typically, the patient with peritonitis tends to breathe shallowly and move as little as possible to minimize pain. He may lie on his back, with his knees flexed, to relax abdominal muscles. Diagnosis Severe abdominal pain in a person with direct or rebound tenderness suggests peritonitis. Abdominal X-rays or computed tomography\\nscan showing edematous and gaseous distention of the small and large bowel support the diagnosis. In the case of perforation of a visceral organ, the X-ray shows air lying under the diaphragm in the abdominal cavity. Other appropriate tests include the following: Chest X-ray may show elevation of the diaphragm. Blood studies show leukocytosis (more than 20,000/\\u00b5l). Paracentesis reveals bacteria, exudate, blood, pus, or urine. Laparotomy may be necessary to identify the underlying cause. Treatment Early treatment of GI inflammatory conditions and preoperative and postoperative antibiotic therapy help prevent peritonitis. After peritonitis develops, emergency treatment must combat\\ninfection, restore intestinal motility, and replace fluids and electrolytes. Antibiotic therapy depends on the infecting organisms. If\\nperitonitis is associated with peritoneal dialysis, antibiotics may be infused through the dialysis catheter; however, if the infection is severe, the catheter must be removed. To decrease peristalsis and prevent perforation, the patient should receive nothing by mouth; he should receive supportive fluids and electrolytes parenterally. Other supplementary treatment measures include preoperative and postoperative administration of an analgesic, nasogastric (NG) intubation to decompress the bowel and, possibly, using\\na rectal tube to facilitate passage of flatus. When peritonitis results\\nfrom perforation, surgery is necessary as soon as possible. Surgery aims to eliminate the source of infection by evacuating the spilled contents and inserting drains. Special considerations Patient care includes monitoring and measures to prevent complications and the spread of infection. Monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid intake and output, and amount of NG drainage or vomitus. Place the patient in semi-Fowler's position to help him deep-breathe with less pain and thus prevent pulmonary complications and to help localize purulent exudate in his lower abdomen or pelvis. After surgery to evacuate the peritoneum: Maintain parenteral fluid and electrolyte administration, as ordered. Accurately record fluid intake and output, including NG tube and any drain output. Place the patient in semi-Fowler's position to promote drainage (through drainage tube) by gravity. Move him carefully because the slightest movement will intensify the pain. Implement other safety measures if fever and pain disorient the patient. Encourage and assist ambulation, as ordered, usually on the first postoperative day. Watch for signs of dehiscence (the patient\\nmay complain that \\u201csomething gave way\\u201d) and abscess formation (continued abdominal tenderness and fever). Frequently assess for peristaltic activity\\nby listening for bowel sounds and checking for gas, bowel movements, and a soft abdomen. Gradually decrease parenteral fluids and increase oral fluids. P Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction is the partial or complete blockage of the lumen in the small or large bowel. Small-bowel obstruction is far more common (90% of patients) and usually more serious. Complete obstruction in any part of the bowel, if untreated, can cause death within hours from shock and vascular collapse. Intestinal obstruction usually occurs after abdominal surgery or in persons with congenital bowel deformities. Causes and incidence Adhesions and strangulated hernias usually cause small-bowel obstruction; large-bowel obstruction is typically due to carcinomas. Mechanical intestinal obstruction results from foreign bodies (fruit pits, gallstones, or worms) or compression of the bowel wall due to stenosis, intussusception, volvulus of the sigmoid or cecum,\\ntumors, or atresia. Nonmechanical obstruction results from physiologic disturbances, such as paralytic ileus, electrolyte imbalances, toxicity (uremia or generalized infection), neurogenic abnormalities (spinal cord\\nlesions), and thrombosis or embolism of mesenteric vessels. (See Paralytic ileus .) Intestinal obstruction develops in three forms: Simple: Blockage prevents intestinal contents from passing, with no other complications or with a change in blood flow. Strangulated: The blood supply to part or all of the obstructed section is cut off, in addition to blockage of the lumen. Close-looped: Both ends of a bowel section are occluded, isolating it from the rest of the intestine. The physiologic effects are similar in all three forms of obstruction: When intestinal obstruction occurs, fluid, air, and gas collect near the site. Peristalsis increases temporarily as the bowel tries to force its contents through the obstruction, injuring intestinal\\nmucosa and causing distention at and above the site of the obstruction. Distention blocks the flow of venous blood and halts normal absorptive processes; as a result, the bowel begins to secrete water, sodium, and potassium into the fluid pooled in the lumen. PARALYTIC ILEUS Paralytic ileus is a physiologic form of intestinal obstruction that usually develops in the small bowel after abdominal surgery. It causes decreased or absent intestinal motility that usually recovers spontaneously after 2 to 3 days. Clinical effects of paralytic ileus include severe abdominal distention, extreme distress and, possibly, vomiting. The patient may be severely constipated or may pass flatus and small, liquid stools. Causes This condition can develop as a response to trauma, toxemia, or peritonitis or as a result of electrolyte deficiencies (especially hypokalemia) and the use of certain drugs, such as ganglionic blocking agents and anticholinergics. It can also result from\\nvascular causes, such as thrombosis or embolism. Excessive air swallowing may contribute to it, but paralytic ileus brought on by this factor alone seldom lasts more than 24 hours. Treatment Paralytic ileus lasting longer than 48 hours requires intubation for decompression and nasogastric suctioning. Because of the absence of peristaltic activity, a long, weighted intestinal tube\\u2014called\\na Miller-Abbott tube \\u2014 may be necessary in the patient with extraordinary abdominal distention. However, such procedures must be used with extreme caution because additional trauma to the bowel can aggravate ileus. When paralytic ileus results from surgical manipulation of the bowel, treatment may also include cholinergic agents, such as neostigmine or bethanechol. When caring for patients with paralytic ileus, warn those receiving cholinergic agents to expect certain paradoxical P adverse effects, such as intestinal cramps and diarrhea. Remember that neostigmine produces cardiovascular adverse effects, usually bradycardia\\nand hypotension. Check frequently for returning bowel sounds. Obstruction in the small intestine results in metabolic alkalosis from dehydration and loss of gastric hydrochloric acid; lower bowel obstruction causes slower dehydration and loss of intestinal alkaline fluids, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Ultimately, intestinal\\nobstruction may lead to ischemia, necrosis, and death. (See Symptom progression in intestinal obstruction, pages 276 and 277.) ELDER TIP Watch for air-fluid lock syndrome in\\nolder adults who remain recumbent for extended periods. In this syndrome, fluid first collects in the dependent bowel loops. Then peristalsis is too weak to push fluid \\u201cuphill.\\u201d The resulting obstruction primarily occurs in the large bowel. Complications Perforation Peritonitis Septicemia Secondary infection Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis Hypovolemic or septic shock Signs and symptoms Colicky pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention characterize small-bowel obstruction. It may also cause drowsiness, intense thirst, malaise, and aching and may dry up oral mucous membranes and the tongue. Auscultation reveals bowel sounds, borborygmi, and rushes; occasionally, these are loud enough to be heard without a stethoscope. Palpation elicits abdominal tenderness, with moderate distention; rebound tenderness occurs when obstruction has caused strangulation with ischemia. In late stages, signs of hypovolemic shock result from progressive dehydration and plasma loss. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SYMPTOM PROGRESSION IN INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION A partial or complete blockage of the small or large intestine creates an obstruction with resultant symptoms. In complete small-bowel obstruction, vigorous peristaltic\\nwaves propel bowel contents toward the mouth instead of the rectum. Spasms may occur every 3 to 5 minutes and last about 1 minute each, with\\npersistent epigastric or periumbilical pain. Passage of small amounts of mucus and P 7 blood may occur. The higher the obstruction, the earlier and more severe the vomiting. Vomitus initially contains gastric juice, then bile, and finally contents of the ileum. Symptoms of large-bowel obstruction develop more slowly because the colon can absorb fluid from its contents and distend well beyond its normal size. Constipation may be the only clinical effect for\\ndays. Colicky abdominal pain may then appear suddenly, producing spasms that last less than 1 minute each and recur every few minutes. Continuous hypogastric pain and nausea may develop, but vomiting is usually absent at first. Large-bowel obstruction can cause dramatic abdominal distention; loops of the large bowel may become visible on the\\nabdomen. Eventually, complete large-bowel obstruction may cause fecal vomiting, continuous pain, or localized peritonitis. Patients with partial obstruction may display any of the previously discussed signs and symptoms in a milder form. However, leakage of liquid stool around the obstruction is common in partial obstruction. Diagnosis Progressive, colicky, abdominal pain and distention, with or without nausea and vomiting, suggest bowel obstruction. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Tests that show obstruction include barium enema, abdominal computed tomography, upper GI and small- bowel series, and abdominal films. Abdominal films show the presence and location of intestinal gas or fluid. In small-bowel obstruction, a typical \\u201cstepladder\\u201d pattern emerges, with alternating fluid and gas levels apparent in 3 to 4 hours. In large-bowel obstruction, barium enema reveals a distended, air-filled colon or a closed loop of sigmoid with extreme distention (in sigmoid volvulus). Laboratory results supporting this diagnosis include: P decreased sodium, chloride, and potassium levels (due to vomiting) a slightly elevated white blood cell count (with necrosis, peritonitis, or strangulation) an increased serum amylase level (possibly from irritation of the pancreas by bowel loop). Treatment Preoperative therapy consists of correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, decompression of the bowel to relieve vomiting and distention, and treatment of shock and peritonitis. Strangulated obstruction usually necessitates blood replacement as well as I.V. fluid administration. Decompression of the intestine may be accomplished with\\nthe use of a nasogastric (NG) tube inserted into the stomach or intestine to relieve distension and vomiting. Close monitoring of the patient's condition determines the duration of treatment; if he fails to improve or if his condition deteriorates, surgery is necessary. In large-bowel obstruction, surgical\\nresection with anastomosis, colostomy, or ileostomy commonly follows decompression with an NG tube. Total parenteral nutrition may be appropriate if the patient suffers a protein deficit from chronic obstruction, postoperative or paralytic ileus, or infection. Drug therapy includes analgesics, sedatives, and antibiotics for peritonitis due to bowel strangulation or infarction. Special considerations Effective management of intestinal obstruction, a life-threatening condition that commonly causes overwhelming pain and distress, requires skillful supportive care and keen observation. ALERT Monitor the patient's vital signs frequently. A drop in blood pressure may indicate reduced circulating blood volume due to blood loss from a strangulated hernia. Observe the patient closely for signs of shock (pallor, rapid pulse, and hypotension). Stay alert for signs and symptoms of metabolic alkalosis (changes in sensorium; slow, shallow respirations; hypertonic muscles; and tetany) or acidosis (shortness of breath on exertion, disorientation and, later, deep, rapid breathing, weakness, and malaise). Watch for signs and symptoms of secondary infection, such as fever and chills. Monitor the patient's urine output carefully to assess renal function, circulating blood volume, and possible urine retention caused by bladder compression by the distended intestine. If you suspect bladder compression, catheterize the patient for residual urine immediately after he has voided. Also, measure abdominal girth frequently to detect progressive distention. Provide mouth and nose care if the patient\\nhas vomited or undergone decompression by intubation. Look for signs of\\ndehydration (thick, swollen tongue; dry, cracked lips; and dry oral mucous membranes). Record the amount and color of drainage from the decompression tube. Irrigate the tube with normal saline solution to maintain patency. If a weighted tube has been inserted, check periodically to make sure it's advancing. Help the patient turn from side to side (or walk around, if he can) to facilitate passage of the tube. Keep the patient in Fowler's position as much as possible to promote pulmonary ventilation and ease respiratory distress from abdominal distention. Listen for bowel sounds, and watch for signs of returning peristalsis (passage of flatus and mucus through the rectum). Explain all diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to the patient, and answer any questions he may have. Make sure that he understands that these procedures are necessary to relieve the obstruction and reduce pain. Tell him to lie on his left side for about a half hour before X-rays are taken. Prepare the patient and his family for the\\npossibility of surgery, and provide emotional support and positive reinforcement afterward. P Arrange for an enterostomal therapist to visit the patient who has had an ostomy. Inguinal hernia A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ protrudes through an abnormal opening in the containing wall of its cavity. Hernias typically occur in the abdominal cavity. Although many kinds of abdominal hernias are possible, inguinal hernias (also called ruptures ) are most common. (See Common sites of hernia .)\\nIn an inguinal hernia, the large or small intestine, omentum, or bladder protrudes into the inguinal canal. Hernias can be reduced (if the hernia can be manipulated back into place with relative ease), incarcerated (if the hernia can't be reduced because adhesions have formed, obstructing the intestinal flow), or strangulated (part of the herniated intestine becomes twisted or edematous, seriously interfering with normal blood flow and peristalsis, and possibly leading to intestinal obstruction and necrosis). Causes and incidence An inguinal hernia may be indirect or direct. An indirect\\ninguinal hernia, the more common form, results from weakness in the fascial margin of the internal inguinal ring. In an indirect hernia, abdominal viscera leave the abdomen through the inguinal ring and follow\\nthe spermatic cord (in males) or round ligament (in females); they emerge at the external ring and extend down the inguinal canal, commonly\\ninto the scrotum or labia. An indirect inguinal hernia may develop at any age, is more common in males, and is especially prevalent in infants\\nyounger than age 1. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 5 out of 100 children have inguinal hernias. A direct inguinal hernia results from a weakness in the fascial floor of the inguinal canal. Instead of entering the canal through the internal ring, the hernia passes through the posterior inguinal wall, protrudes directly through the transverse fascia of the canal (in an area known as Hesselbach's triangle ), and comes out at the external ring. COMMON SITES OF HERNIA Femoral hernia occurs where the femoral artery passes into the femoral canal. Typically, a fatty deposit within the femoral canal enlarges and eventually creates a hole big enough to accommodate part of the peritoneum and bladder. A femoral hernia appears as a swelling or bulge at the pulse point of the large femoral artery. It's usually a soft, pliable, reducible, nontender mass, but commonly becomes\\nincarcerated or strangulated. Umbilical hernia results from abnormal muscular structures around the umbilical cord. This hernia is quite common in neonates, but also occurs in women who are obese or who have had several\\npregnancies. Because most umbilical hernias in infants close spontaneously, surgery is warranted only if the hernia persists for more than 4 or 5 years. Taping or binding the affected area or supporting it\\nwith a truss may relieve symptoms until the hernia closes. Severe congenital umbilical hernia allows the abdominal viscera to protrude outside the body. This condition necessitates immediate repair. Incisional (ventral) hernia develops at the site of previous surgery, usually along vertical incisions. This hernia may result from a weakness in the abdominal wall, perhaps as a result of an infection or impaired wound healing. Inadequate nutrition, extreme abdominal distention, or obesity also predispose the patient to incisional hernia. Palpation of an incisional hernia may reveal several defects in the surgical scar. Effective repair requires pulling the layers of the abdominal wall together without creating tension. If this isn't possible, surgical reconstruction uses Teflon, Marlex mesh, or tantalum mesh to close the opening. Inguinal hernia can be direct or indirect. Indirect inguinal hernia causes the abdominal viscera to protrude through the inguinal ring and follow the spermatic cord (in males) or round ligament\\n(in females). Direct inguinal hernia P results from a weakness in the fascial floor of the inguinal canal. In males, during the seventh month of gestation, the testicle normally descends into the scrotum, preceded by the peritoneal sac. If the sac closes improperly, it leaves an opening through which the intestine can slip. In either sex, a hernia can result from weak abdominal muscles (caused by congenital malformation, trauma, or aging) or increased intra-abdominal pressure (due to heavy lifting, pregnancy, obesity, or straining). About 10% of people develop some type of hernia during their lifetime, and more than 500,000 hernia operations are performed in\\nthe United States each year. Hernias are seven times more common in males than in females. Complications Incarceration or strangulation of the bowel Intestinal obstruction Intestinal necrosis Signs and symptoms Inguinal hernia usually causes a lump to appear over the herniated area when the patient stands or strains. The lump disappears when the patient is supine. Tension on the herniated contents may cause a\\nsharp, steady pain in the groin, which fades when the hernia is reduced. Strangulation produces severe pain and may lead to partial or complete bowel obstruction and even intestinal necrosis. Partial bowel obstruction may cause anorexia, vomiting, pain and tenderness in the groin, an irreducible mass, and diminished bowel sounds. Complete obstruction may cause shock, high fever, absent bowel sounds, and bloody\\nstools. PEDIATRIC TIP In an infant, an inguinal hernia commonly coexists with an undescended testicle or a hydrocele. Diagnosis In a patient with a large hernia, physical examination reveals an obvious swelling or lump in the inguinal area. In the patient\\nwith a small hernia, the affected area may simply appear full. Palpation of the inguinal area while the patient is performing Valsalva's maneuver confirms the diagnosis. To detect a hernia in a male\\npatient, the patient is asked to stand with his ipsilateral leg slightly flexed and his weight resting on the other leg. The examiner inserts an index finger into the lower part of the scrotum and invaginates the scrotal skin so the finger advances through the external\\ninguinal ring to the internal ring (about 1\\u00bd\\u2033 to 2\\u2033 [4 cm to 5 cm] through the inguinal canal). The patient is then told to cough. If the examiner feels pressure against the fingertip, an indirect hernia exists; if pressure is felt against the side of the finger, a direct hernia exists. A patient history of sharp or \\u201ccatching\\u201d pain when lifting or straining may help confirm the diagnosis. Suspected bowel obstruction requires X- rays and a white blood cell count (may be elevated). Treatment If the hernia is reducible, the pain may be temporarily relieved by pushing the hernia back into place. A truss may keep the abdominal contents from protruding into the hernial sac; however, this won't cure the hernia. This device is especially beneficial for an elderly or debilitated patient for whom surgery might be hazardous. For infants, adults, and otherwise healthy elderly patients, herniorrhaphy is the treatment of choice. Herniorrhaphy replaces the contents of the hernial sac into the abdominal cavity and closes the opening. In many cases, this procedure is performed under local anesthesia in a short-term unit or as a single-day admission. Another effective surgical procedure for repairing hernia is hernioplasty, which reinforces the weakened area with steel mesh, fascia, or wire. A strangulated or necrotic hernia necessitates bowel resection. Rarely, an extensive resection may require temporary colostomy. In either case, bowel resection lengthens postoperative recovery and requires antibiotics, parenteral fluids, and electrolyte replacement. P Special considerations Care includes managing symptoms to increase patient comfort and prevent worsening. Apply a truss only after a hernia has been\\nreduced. For best results, apply it in the morning, before the patient gets out of bed. To prevent skin irritation, tell the patient to bathe daily and apply cornstarch or baby powder. Warn against\\napplying the truss over clothing because this reduces the effectiveness\\nof the truss and may make it slip. ALERT If incarceration and strangulation occur, don't try to reduce the hernia because this may perforate the bowel. If severe intestinal obstruction develops because of hernial strangulation, inform the physician immediately. A nasogastric tube may be inserted promptly to empty the stomach and relieve pressure on the hernial sac. Before surgery for an incarcerated hernia,\\nclosely monitor the patient's vital signs. Administer I.V. fluids and analgesics, as ordered. Place the patient in Trendelenburg's position to\\nreduce pressure on the hernia site. Give special reassurance and emotional support to a child and parents when hernia repair is scheduled. Encourage him to ask questions, and answer them as simply as possible. Offer appropriate diversions to distract him from the impending surgery. After outpatient surgery, make sure that the patient voids before he leaves the hospital. Teach him to check his incision and dressing for drainage, inflammation, or swelling and to watch for fever. If any of these occur, he should notify the physician. To reduce scrotal swelling, have the patient support the scrotum with a rolled towel and apply an ice bag. Instruct the patient to drink plenty of fluids to maintain hydration and prevent constipation. Before discharge, warn the patient against\\nlifting heavy objects or straining during bowel movements. In addition,\\ntell him to watch for signs and symptoms of infection (oozing, tenderness, warmth, and redness) at the incision site and to keep the incision clean and covered until the sutures are removed. Advise the patient not to resume normal activity or return to work without the surgeon's permission. Intussusception Intussusception is a telescoping (invagination) of a portion of the bowel into an adjacent distal portion. Intussusception may be fatal, especially if treatment is delayed for more than 24 hours. Causes and incidence When a bowel segment (the intussusceptum) invaginates, peristalsis propels it along the bowel, pulling more bowel along with it; the receiving segment is the intussuscipiens. This invagination produces edema, hemorrhage from venous engorgement, incarceration, and obstruction. If treatment is delayed for longer than 24 hours, strangulation of the intestine usually occurs, with gangrene, shock, and perforation. (See Understanding intussusception , page 282.) Seasonal peaks\\u2014in the spring-summer, coinciding with peak\\nincidence of enteritis, and in the midwinter, coinciding with peak incidence of respiratory tract infections\\u2014have been noted in the incidence of intussusception, suggesting a connection to viral infections. Other potential causes include a mass, such as a lymph node,\\npolyp, or tumor that telescopes the gut and leads to intussusception. Although it can affect adults, intussusception is most common in infants ages 6 months to 1 year. It occurs twice as often in male infants as in female infants. Complications P Strangulation of intestine Gangrene Shock Perforation Peritonitis UNDERSTANDING INTUSSUSCEPTION In intussusception, a bowel section invaginates and is propelled along by peristalsis, pulling in more bowel. In this illustration, a portion of the cecum invaginates and is propelled into the large intestine. Intussusception typically produces edema, hemorrhage from venous engorgement, incarceration, and obstruction. Signs and symptoms PEDIATRIC TIP In an infant or child, intussusception produces four cardinal clinical effects: Intermittent attacks of colicky pain cause the child to scream, draw his legs up to his abdomen, turn pale and diaphoretic and, possibly, display grunting respirations. Vomiting of stomach contents may occur initially, followed by further vomiting of bilestained or fecal material. \\u201cCurrant-jelly\\u201d stools, containing a mixture of blood and mucus, may be observed. The patient will have\\na tender, distended abdomen, with a palpable, sausage-shaped abdominal mass; the viscera are usually absent from the right lower quadrant. In adults, intussusception produces nonspecific, chronic,\\nand intermittent symptoms, including colicky abdominal pain and tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally constipation), bloody stools, and weight loss. Abdominal pain usually localizes in the right lower quadrant, radiates to the back, and increases with eating. Adults with severe intussusception may develop strangulation with excruciating pain, abdominal distention, and tachycardia. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Barium enema confirms colonic intussusception when it shows the characteristic coiled-spring sign; it also delineates the extent of intussusception. Upright abdominal X-rays may show a soft-tissue mass and signs of complete or partial obstruction, with dilated loops of bowel. Signs of dehydration or shock support the diagnosis, as does the presence of a palpable mass in the abdomen. Treatment In children, therapy may include hydrostatic reduction or\\nsurgery. Surgery is indicated for children with recurrent intussusception, for P those who show signs of shock or peritonitis, and for those in whom symptoms have been present longer than 24 hours. In adults, surgery is always the treatment of choice. During hydrostatic reduction, the radiologist drips a barium solution into the rectum from a height of no more than 3\\u2032 (1 m); fluoroscopy traces the progress of the barium. If the procedure is successful, the barium backwashes into the ileum, and the mass disappears. If not, the procedure is stopped, and the patient is prepared for surgery. During surgery, manual reduction is attempted first. After compressing the bowel above the intussusception, the physician attempts to milk the intussusception back through the bowel. However, if\\nmanual reduction fails or if the bowel is gangrenous or strangulated, the physician will perform a resection of the affected bowel segment. Special considerations Care focuses on changes in the patient's condition that might indicate worsening. ALERT Monitor the patient's vital signs before and after surgery. A change in temperature may indicate sepsis; infants may become hypothermic at the onset of infection. Rising pulse rate and falling blood pressure may be signs of peritonitis. Check the patient's intake and output. Watch for signs of dehydration and bleeding. A nasogastric (NG) tube is inserted to decompress the intestine and minimize vomiting. Monitor tube drainage and replace volume lost, as ordered. Monitor the patient who has undergone hydrostatic reduction for passage of stools and barium, a sign that the reduction was successful. Keep in mind that the patient may have a recurrence of intussusception, usually within the first 24 to 36 hours after the reduction. After surgery, administer antibiotics, as ordered. Closely check the incision for inflammation, drainage, or suture separation. Encourage the patient to deep-breathe and cough productively. Be sure to splint the incision when he coughs, or teach him to do so himself. The NG tube may be removed when bowel sounds and peristalsis resume. The patient's diet can be advanced as tolerated. Check for abdominal distention after the patient resumes a normal diet and monitor his general condition. Offer special reassurance and emotional support to the child and parents. This condition is considered a pediatric emergency, and parents are generally unprepared for their child's hospitalization and possible surgery; they may feel guilty for not seeking medical aid sooner. Similarly, the child is unprepared for a\\nseparation from his parents and home. To minimize the stress of hospitalization, encourage parents to participate in their child's care as much as possible. Volvulus Volvulus is a twisting of the intestine at least 180 degrees on its mesentery, which results in blood vessel compression and ischemia. Causes and incidence Twisting in volvulus may result from an anomaly of rotation, an ingested foreign body, or an adhesion; in some cases, however, the cause is unknown. Volvulus usually occurs in a bowel segment with a mesentery long enough to twist. The most common area, particularly in adults, is the sigmoid; the small bowel is a common site\\nin children. Other common sites include the stomach and cecum. Volvulus\\nsecondary to meconium ileus may occur in patients with cystic fibrosis. Acute gastric volvulus has a mortality rate of 42% to 56%. There's no racial predilection, and it affects males and females equally. Peak incidence occurs in people ages 40 to 50, but about 20% of\\ncases occur in infants younger than age 1. P Complications Strangulation of the twisted intestinal loop Ischemia Infarction Perforation Fatal peritonitis Signs and symptoms Vomiting and rapid, marked abdominal distention follow sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, bloody stools, constipation, and shock may occur. Without immediate treatment, volvulus\\ncan lead to strangulation of the twisted bowel loop, ischemia, infarction, perforation, and fatal peritonitis. Diagnosis The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and physical examination that may reveal a palpable mass suggest volvulus. Appropriate tests include the following: X-rays\\u2014Abdominal X-rays may show obstruction and abnormal air-fluid levels in the sigmoid and cecum; in midgut volvulus, abdominal X-rays may be normal. Computed tomography scan\\u2014may show evidence of intestinal obstruction. Barium enema\\u2014In cecal volvulus, barium fills the colon distal to the section of cecum; in sigmoid volvulus in children, barium may twist to a point and, in adults, it may take on an \\u201cace of spades\\u201d configuration. Upper GI series (with small bowel follow-through)\\u2014In midgut volvulus, obstruction and possibly a twisted contour show in a narrow area near the duodenojejunal junction, where barium won't pass. White blood cell count\\u2014In strangulation, the count is greater than 15,000/\\u00b5l; in bowel infarction, greater than 20,000/\\u00b5l. Treatment Treatment varies according to the severity and location of the volvulus. For children with midgut volvulus, treatment is surgical. For adults with sigmoid volvulus, a proctoscopic examination is performed to check for infarction, and nonsurgical treatment includes\\nreduction by careful insertion of a sigmoidoscope or a long rectal tube\\nto deflate the bowel. Success of nonsurgical reduction is indicated by expulsion of gas and immediate relief from abdominal pain. If the bowel is distended but viable, surgery consists of detorsion (untwisting); if the bowel is necrotic, surgery includes resection and anastomosis. Special considerations After surgical correction of volvulus: Monitor the patient's vital signs, watching for temperature changes (a sign of sepsis) and a rapid pulse rate and falling blood pressure (signs of shock and peritonitis). Carefully monitor fluid intake and output (including stools), electrolyte values, and complete blood count. Be sure to measure and record drainage from the nasogastric (NG) tube and drains. Encourage frequent coughing and deep breathing with splinting of the incision. Reposition the patient often and perform suction as needed. Record excessive or unusual drainage. Check for incisional inflammation and separation of sutures. When bowel sounds and peristalsis return, remove the NG tube and begin oral feedings with clear liquids, as ordered. When solid food can be tolerated, gradually expand the diet. Reassure the patient and his family appropriately, and explain all diagnostic procedures. If the patient is a child, encourage parents to participate in their child's care to minimize the stress of hospitalization. Inactive colon Inactive colon, also known as lazy colon, colonic stasis, or atonic constipation, is a state of chronic constipation that, if untreated, may lead to fecal impaction. Causes and incidence Inactive colon usually results from some deficiency in the three elements necessary for normal bowel activity: dietary bulk, fluid intake, and exercise. It's common in bedridden people because of their inactivity and is generally relieved with diet and exercise. Other\\npossible causes can include habitual disregard of the impulse to defecate, emotional conflicts, chronic use of laxatives, or prolonged dependence on enemas, which dull rectal sensitivity to the presence of feces. Signs and symptoms The primary symptom of inactive colon is chronic constipation. The patient commonly strains to produce hard, dry stools accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. Straining can aggravate other rectal conditions such as hemorrhoids. Diagnosis A patient history of dry, hard, infrequent stools suggests inactive colon. A digital rectal examination reveals stool in the lower portion of the rectum and a palpable colon. Proctoscopy may show an unusually small colon lumen, prominent veins, and an abnormal amount of mucus. Diagnostic tests to rule out other causes include upper\\nGI series, barium enema, and examination of stool for occult blood from\\nneoplasms. Treatment Treatment varies according to the patient's age and condition. A higher- bulk diet, sufficient exercise, and increased fluid intake commonly relieve constipation. Treatment for severe constipation may include bulk-forming laxatives, such as psyllium, or well-lubricated\\nglycerin suppositories; for P fecal impaction, manual removal of feces is necessary. Administration of an oilretention enema usually precedes removal; an enema is also necessary afterward. For lasting relief from constipation, the patient with inactive colon must modify bowel habits. PREVENTION PREVENTING CONSTIPATION Recommend these lifestyle changes to your patients to help them avoid constipation. Increase fluids Advise the patient to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses (2 qt [2 L]) of liquid every day because fluids help keep the intestinal contents in a semisolid state for easier passage. This is particularly important for an older patient. Stimulate the bowel with a drink of hot coffee, warm lemonade, iced liquids\\u2014plain or with lemon\\u2014or prune juice before breakfast or in the evening. Add fiber Adding fiber to the diet with foods such as whole grain cereals (rolled oats, bran, shredded wheat, brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oatmeal) to contribute bulk and induces peristalsis. However, too much bran can create an irritable bowel, so keep watch of the fiber content (low fiber\\u20140.3 to 1 g; moderate fiber\\u20141.1 to 2 g; high fiber\\u20142.1 to 4.2 g). Include fresh fruits with skins as well as raw and coarse vegetables (broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, lettuce, and turnips) in the diet for additional bulk. Avoid fats Moderate the consumption of fatcontaining foods, such as bacon, butter, cream, and oil. Although these foods will help to soften intestinal contents, they sometimes cause diarrhea. Instruct the patient to avoid highly refined foods, such as white rice, cream of wheat, farina, white pastries, pie or cake, macaroni, spaghetti, noodles, candy, cookies, and\\nice cream. Exercise The patient should incorporate moderate exercise, such as walking, into his daily routine. Take prescribed medications Bulk-forming laxatives, such as psyllium, should be taken with at least 8 oz (240 ml) of liquid. Juices, soft drinks, or other pleasant-tasting liquids help mask the gritty texture of these laxatives. What to avoid Avoid overusing laxatives and maintain a regular time for bowel movements (usually after breakfast). Autosuggestion, relaxation, pleasant reading material, privacy, and use of a small footstool to promote thigh flexion while sitting on the toilet may be helpful. The patient should respond promptly to the urge to defecate. If he worries about constipation, explain that a 2- to 3-day interval between bowel movements can be normal. Advise the patient against overusing enemas. Frequent use of sodium biphosphate, in particular, should be avoided because its hypertonic solution can absorb as much as 10% of the\\ncolon's sodium content or draw intestinal fluids into the colon, thereby causing dehydration. P 6 Special considerations In many cases, patient education can help break the constipation habit. (See Preventing constipation. ) ELDER TIP If an older patient with inactive colon is hospitalized, help him move to a bedside commode for bowel movements because using a bedpan causes additional strain. However, if he must use a bedpan, have him sit in Fowler's position or sit on the pan at the side\\nof his bed to facilitate elimination. Occasional digital rectal stimulation or abdominal massage near the sigmoid area may help stimulate a bowel movement. CHRONIC PANCREATITIS Chronic pancreatitis is associated with alcoholism in over 50% of patients, but it also may follow hyperparathyroidism (causing hypercalcemia), hyperlipidemia or, infrequently, gallstones, trauma, or peptic ulcer. Inflammation and fibrosis cause progressive pancreatic insufficiency and eventually destroy the pancreas. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include constant dull pain with occasional exacerbations, malabsorption, severe weight loss, and hyperglycemia (leading to diabetic symptoms). Diagnosis is based on the patient history, X-rays showing pancreatic calcification, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and examination of stool for steatorrhea. In many cases, the severe pain of chronic pancreatitis requires large doses of analgesics or opioids, making addiction a serious problem. Treatment also includes a low-fat diet and oral administration of pancreatic enzymes, such as pancreatin or pancrelipase, to control steatorrhea; insulin or oral hypoglycemics to curb hyperglycemia; and, occasionally, surgical repair of biliary or pancreatic ducts or the sphincter of Oddi to reduce pressure and promote\\nthe flow of pancreatic juice. The prognosis is good if the patient can avoid alcohol, but poor if he can't. ALERT If the patient has a history of arteriosclerosis, heart failure, or hypertension, constipation and straining may induce Valsalva's maneuver, thereby causing a vagal effect, in which the heart rate slows or stops entirely. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, occurs in acute and chronic forms and may be due to edema, necrosis, or hemorrhage. In men, this disease is commonly associated with alcoholism,\\ntrauma, or peptic ulcer; in women, it's linked to biliary tract disease. The prognosis is good when pancreatitis follows biliary tract disease, but poor when it follows alcoholism. Mortality rises as high as\\n60% when pancreatitis is associated with necrosis and hemorrhage. (See Chronic pancreatitis .) Causes and incidence The most common causes of pancreatitis are biliary tract disease and alcoholism, but it can also result from pancreatic cancer, trauma, or use of certain drugs, such as glucocorticoids, sulfonamides, chlorothiazide, and azathioprine. This disease also may develop as a complication of peptic ulcer, mumps, or hypothermia. Rarer causes are stenosis or obstruction of the sphincter of Oddi, hyperlipidemia, metabolic endocrine disorders (hyperparathyroidism and hemochromatosis), vasculitis or vascular disease, viral infections, mycoplasmal pneumonia, and pregnancy. P Diabetes, pancreatic insufficiency, and calcification occur in young people, probably from malnutrition and alcoholism, and lead to pancreatic atrophy. Regardless of the cause, pancreatitis involves autodigestion: The enzymes normally excreted by the pancreas digest pancreatic tissue. (See Anatomy of the pancreas .) The incidence of acute pancreatitis varies with age. In the United States, it affects 270 of every 100,000 people ages 15 to 44 and 540 of every 100,000 people age 65 and older. It's uncommon in children. Blacks have a higher incidence than Whites. Men and women are affected equally. Among people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it affects 4 to 22 people out of every 100. ANATOMY OF THE PANCREAS Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas involving irritation and infection of the organ. Obstruction or overdistention of\\nthe pancreatic duct can start the inflammation that occurs with pancreatitis. Exposure to toxins and other underlying causes also may start it. The overall effect is a release of activated pancreatic destructive enzymes into the pancreas and surrounding tissue. Complications Diabetes mellitus (if islets of Langerhans are damaged) Massive hemorrhage Destruction of pancreas Diabetes acidosis Shock Coma Adult respiratory distress syndrome Atelectasis Pulmonary effusion Pneumonia GI bleeding Pancreatic abscess P Signs and symptoms In many patients, the first and only symptom of mild pancreatitis is steady epigastric pain centered close to the umbilicus, radiating between the tenth thoracic and sixth lumbar vertebrae, and unrelieved by vomiting. However, a severe attack causes extreme pain, persistent vomiting, abdominal rigidity, diminished bowel activity (suggesting peritonitis), crackles at lung bases, and left pleural effusion. Progression produces extreme malaise and restlessness, with mottled skin, tachycardia, low-grade fever (100\\u00b0 to 102\\u00b0 F [37.7\\u00b0 to 38.8\\u00b0 C]), and cold, sweaty extremities. The proximity of the inflamed pancreas to the bowel may cause ileus. If pancreatitis damages the islets of Langerhans, complications may include diabetes mellitus. Fulminant pancreatitis causes massive hemorrhage and total destruction of the pancreas, resulting in diabetic acidosis, shock, or coma. Diagnosis A thorough patient history (especially for alcoholism) and physical examination are the first steps in diagnosis, but the retroperitoneal position of the pancreas makes physical assessment difficult. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Dramatically elevated serum amylase levels\\u2014in many cases over 500 units/L\\u2014confirm pancreatitis and rule out perforated peptic ulcer, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, and bowel infarction or obstruction. Similarly, dramatic elevations of amylase also occur in urine, ascites, or pleural fluid. Characteristically, amylase levels return to normal 48 hours after the onset of pancreatitis, despite continuing symptoms. Supportive laboratory values include: increased serum lipase levels, which rise more slowly than serum amylase low serum calcium levels (hypocalcemia) from fat necrosis and formation of calcium soaps white blood cell counts ranging from 8,000 to 20,000/\\u00b5l, with increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes elevated glucose levels\\u2014as high as 500 to 900 mg/dl, indicating hyperglycemia. Tests used to diagnose pancreatitis may include the following: Abdominal X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans show dilation of the small or large bowel or calcification of the pancreas. Ultrasound or CT scan reveals an increased\\npancreatic diameter and helps distinguish acute cholecystitis from acute pancreatitis. Treatment The goal of therapy is to maintain circulation and fluid volume. Treatment measures must also relieve pain and decrease pancreatic secretions. Emergency treatment of shock (which is the most common cause of death in earlystage pancreatitis) consists of vigorous I.V. replacement of electrolytes and proteins. Metabolic acidosis that develops secondary to hypovolemia and impaired cellular perfusion requires vigorous fluid volume replacement. Drug treatment may include meperidine for pain, diazepam for restlessness and agitation, and antibiotics for bacterial infections. Morphine and codeine are usually avoided as pain medications\\nbecause of their effect on the sphincter of Oddi. If the patient has hypocalcemia, he'll need an infusion of 10% calcium gluconate; if he has\\nelevated serum glucose levels, he may require insulin therapy. After the emergency phase, continuing I.V. therapy should\\nprovide adequate electrolytes and protein solutions that don't stimulate the pancreas for 5 to 7 days. If the patient isn't ready to resume oral feedings by then, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be necessary. Nonstimulating elemental gavage feedings may be safer because\\nof the decreased risk of infection and overinfusion. In extreme cases, P laparotomy to debride the pancreatic bed, partial pancreatectomy, or a combination of both and feeding jejunostomy may be necessary. Special considerations Acute pancreatitis is a life-threatening emergency, requiring meticulous supportive care and continuous monitoring of vital systems. Monitor the patient's vital signs and pulmonary artery pressure or central venous pressure closely. Give plasma or albumin, if ordered, to maintain blood pressure. Record fluid intake and output; check urine output hourly, and monitor electrolyte levels. Assess for crackles, rhonchi, or decreased breath sounds. For bowel decompression, maintain constant\\nor intermittent nasogastric suctioning, and give nothing by mouth. Perform good mouth and nose care. Watch for signs and symptoms of calcium deficiency\\u2014tetany, cramps, carpopedal spasm, and seizures. If you suspect hypocalcemia, keep airway and suction apparatus handy and pad side rails. Administer analgesics as needed to relieve\\nthe patient's pain and anxiety. Remember that anticholinergics reduce salivary and sweat gland secretions. Warn the patient that he may experience dry mouth and facial flushing. Caution: Narrow-angle glaucoma contraindicates the use of atropine or its derivatives. Monitor glucose levels. Watch for complications due to TPN, such as sepsis, hypokalemia, overhydration, and metabolic acidosis. Watch for fever, cardiac irregularities, changes\\nin arterial blood gas measurements, and deep respirations. Use strict aseptic technique when caring for the catheter insertion site. TYPES OF HEMORRHOIDS Covered by mucosa, internal hemorrhoids bulge into the rectal lumen and may prolapse during defecation. Covered by skin, external hemorrhoids protrude from the rectum and are more likely to thrombose than internal hemorrhoids. The illustrations below show frontal and cross-sectional views. ANORECTUM Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are varicosities in the superior or inferior hemorrhoidal venous plexus. Dilation and enlargement of the superior plexus produce internal hemorrhoids; dilation and enlargement of the inferior plexus produce external hemorrhoids that may protrude from the rectum. (See Types of hemorrhoids .) Hemorrhoids occur in both sexes; incidence is usually highest between ages 20 and 50. Causes and incidence Hemorrhoids probably result from increased venous pressure in the hemorrhoidal plexus. Predisposing factors include occupations that P require prolonged standing or sitting; straining due to\\nconstipation, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, or vomiting; heart failure;\\nhepatic disease, such as cirrhosis, amebic abscesses, or hepatitis; alcoholism; anorectal infections; loss of muscle tone due to old age, rectal surgery, or episiotomy; anal intercourse; and pregnancy. Hemorrhoids are more common in whites, in persons of higher socioeconomic classes, and in persons who live in rural areas. However, actual incidence figures are unknown because many patients with hemorrhoids self-medicate. Complications Local infection Thrombosis Signs and symptoms Although hemorrhoids may be asymptomatic, they characteristically cause painless, intermittent bleeding, which occurs on defecation. Bright red blood appears on stool or on toilet paper due to injury of the fragile mucosa covering the hemorrhoid. These first-degree hemorrhoids may itch because of poor anal hygiene. When second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse, they're usually painless and spontaneously return to the anal canal following defecation. Third-degree hemorrhoids cause constant discomfort and prolapse in response to any increase in intra- abdominal pressure. They must be manually reduced. Thrombosis of external hemorrhoids produces sudden rectal pain and a subcutaneous, large, firm lump that the patient can feel. If hemorrhoids cause severe or recurrent bleeding, they may lead to secondary anemia with significant pallor, fatigue, and weakness; however, such systemic complications are rare. Diagnosis Physical examination confirms external hemorrhoids. Proctoscopy confirms internal hemorrhoids and rules out rectal polyps. Treatment Treatment depends on the type and severity of the hemorrhoid and on the patient's overall condition. Generally, treatment includes measures to ease pain, combat swelling and congestion, and regulate bowel habits. The patient can relieve constipation by increasing the amount of raw vegetables, fruit, and whole grain cereal in the diet or by using stool softeners. Venous congestion can be prevented by avoiding prolonged sitting; local swelling and pain can be decreased with local anesthetic agents (lotions, creams, or suppositories), astringents, or cold compresses, followed by warm sitz baths or thermal packs. Rarely, the patient with chronic, profuse bleeding may require a blood transfusion. Other nonsurgical treatments are injection of a sclerosing solution to produce scar tissue that decreases prolapse, manual reduction, and hemorrhoid ligation or laser ablation. Hemorrhoidectomy, the most effective treatment, is necessary for patients with severe bleeding, intolerable pain and pruritus, and large prolapse. This procedure is contraindicated in patients with blood dyscrasias (acute leukemia, aplastic anemia, or hemophilia) or GI carcinoma and during the first trimester of pregnancy. Special considerations Patient care includes preoperative and postoperative support. To prepare the patient for hemorrhoidectomy, administer an enema as appropriate (usually 2 to 4 hours before surgery), and record results. Prepare the area as ordered. Postoperatively, check for signs of prolonged rectal bleeding, administer adequate analgesics, and provide sitz baths as ordered. As soon as the patient can resume oral feedings, administer a bulk medication, such as psyllium, about 1 hour after the evening meal, to ensure a daily stool. Warn against using stool-softening medications soon after hemorrhoidectomy because a firm stool acts as a natural dilator to prevent anal stricture from the scar tissue. (The patient may need repeated digital dilation to prevent such narrowing.) Keep the wound site clean to prevent infection and irritation. P Before discharge, stress the importance of\\nregular bowel habits and good anal hygiene. Warn against too-vigorous wiping with washcloths and using harsh soaps. Encourage the use of medicated astringent pads and white toilet paper (the fixative in colored paper can irritate the skin). Anorectal abscess and fistula Anorectal abscess is a localized collection of pus due to inflammation of the soft tissue near the rectum or anus. Inflammation may produce an anal fistula\\u2014an abnormal opening in the anal skin\\u2014that may communicate with the rectum. Causes and incidence The inflammatory process that leads to abscess may begin with an abrasion or tear in the lining of the anal canal, rectum, or perianal skin and subsequent infection by Escherichia coli, staphylococci, or streptococci. Trauma may result from injections for treatment of internal hemorrhoids, enematip abrasions, puncture wounds from ingested eggshells or fish bones, or insertion of foreign objects. Other preexisting lesions include infected anal fissure, infections from\\nthe anal crypt through the anal gland, ruptured anal hematoma, prolapsed thrombosed internal hemorrhoids, and septic lesions in the pelvis, such as acute appendicitis, acute salpingitis, and diverticulitis. Systemic illnesses that may cause abscesses include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, many abscesses develop without preexisting lesions. As the abscess produces more pus, a fistula may form in the soft tissue beneath the muscle fibers of the sphincters (especially the external sphincter), usually extending into the perianal skin. The internal (primary) opening of the abscess or fistula is usually near the\\nanal glands and crypts; the external (secondary) opening, in the perianal skin. The peak incidence of anorectal abscess occurs in people in their 30s and 40s, but there's also a high occurrence in infants. Men\\nare affected two to three times more often than women. About 30% of patients have a previous history of abscess. Complications Anorectal fistula Perineal cellulitis Scar tissue formation Anal stricture Signs and symptoms Characteristics are throbbing pain and tenderness at the site of the abscess. A hard, painful lump develops on one side, preventing comfortable sitting. Discharge of pus may occur from the rectum, and there may be constipation or pain associated with bowel movements. Diagnosis Anorectal abscess is detectable on physical examination. If the abscess drains by forming a fistula, the pain usually subsides and the major signs become pruritic drainage and subsequent perianal irritation. The external opening of a fistula generally appears as a pink or red, elevated, discharging sinus or ulcer on the skin near the anus. Depending on the infection's severity, the patient may have chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. Digital examination may reveal a palpable indurated tract and a drop or two of pus on palpation.\\nThe internal opening may be palpated as a depression or ulcer in the midline anteriorly or at the dentate line posteriorly. Examination with a\\nprobe may require an anesthetic. A proctosigmoidoscopy may be performed\\nto exclude associated diseases. Treatment Anorectal abscesses require surgical incision under caudal anesthesia to promote drainage. Fistulas require a fistulotomy\\u2014removal of the fistula and associated granulation tissue\\u2014under caudal anesthesia. If the fistula tract is epithelialized, treatment requires fistulectomy\\u2014removal of the fistulous tract\\u2014followed by insertion of drains, which remain in place for P 48 hours. Warm sitz baths are useful to relieve inflammation; however, pain medication and antibiotics may be needed. Special considerations After incision to drain anorectal abscess, follow these guidelines: Provide adequate medication for pain relief, as ordered. Examine the wound frequently to assess proper healing, which should progress from the inside out. Healing should be complete in 4 to 5 weeks for perianal fistulas; in 12 to 16 weeks for deeper wounds. Inform the patient that complete recovery takes time, and offer encouragement. Stress the importance of perianal cleanliness. Be alert for the first postoperative bowel movement. The patient may suppress the urge to defecate because of anticipated pain; the resulting constipation\\nincreases pressure at the wound site. Such a patient benefits from a stool-softening laxative. Rectal polyps Rectal polyps are masses of tissue that rise above the mucosal membrane and protrude into the GI tract. Types of polyps include common polypoid adenomas, villous adenomas, hereditary polyposis, focal\\npolypoid hyperplasia, and juvenile polyps (hamartomas). Most rectal polyps are benign; however, villous and hereditary polyps show a marked inclination to become malignant. Indeed, a striking feature of familial polyposis is that it's commonly associated with rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Causes and incidence Formation of polyps results from unrestrained cell growth\\nin the upper epithelium. Predisposing factors include heredity, age, infection, and diet. Villous adenomas are most prevalent in men older than age\\n55; common polypoid adenomas, in white women between ages 45 and 60. Incidence in both sexes rises after age 70. Juvenile polyps usually occur among children younger than age 10 and are characterized by rectal\\nbleeding. Complications Anemia from slow bleeding Bowel obstruction Colorectal cancer Signs and symptoms Because rectal polyps don't generally cause symptoms, they're usually discovered incidentally during a digital examination or rectosigmoidoscopy. Rectal bleeding is a common sign; high rectal polyps leave a streak of blood on the stool, whereas low rectal polyps bleed freely. Rectal polyps vary in appearance. Common polypoid adenomas are small, multiple lesions that are redder than normal mucosa.\\nThey're commonly pedunculated (attached to rectal mucosa by a long, thin stalk) and granular, with a red, lobular, or eroded surface. Villous adenomas are usually sessile (attached to the mucosa by a wide base) and vary in size from 0.5 to 12 cm. They are soft, friable, and finely lobulated. They may grow large and cause painful defecation; however, because adenomas are soft, they rarely cause bowel obstruction. Sometimes adenomas prolapse outside the anus, expelling parts of the adenoma with feces. These polyps may cause diarrhea, bloody stools, and subsequent fluid and electrolyte depletion,\\nwith hypotension and oliguria. In hereditary polyposis, rectal polyps resemble benign adenomas but occur as hundreds of small (0.5 cm) lesions carpeting the entire mucosal surface. Associated signs include diarrhea, bloody stools, and secondary anemia. In patients with hereditary polyposis, changes in bowel habits with abdominal pain usually signal rectosigmoid cancer. P Juvenile polyps are large, inflammatory lesions, commonly\\nwithout an epithelial covering. Mucus-filled cysts cover their usually smooth surface. Focal polypoid hyperplasia produces small (less than 3 mm), granular, sessile lesions, similar to the colon in color, or gray or translucent. They usually occur at the rectosigmoid junction. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Firm diagnosis of rectal polyps requires identification of the polyps through proctosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and rectal biopsy. Barium enema can help identify polyps that are located high in the colon. Supportive laboratory findings include occult blood in the stools, low hemoglobin level and hematocrit (with anemia) and, possibly, serum electrolyte imbalances in patients with villous adenomas. Treatment Treatment varies according to the type and size of the polyps and their location in the colon. Common polypoid adenomas less than 1 cm require polypectomy, usually by fulguration (destruction by high- frequency electricity) during endoscopy. For common polypoid adenomas over 4 cm and all invasive villous adenomas, treatment\\nusually consists of abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection. Focal polypoid hyperplasia can be obliterated by biopsy. Depending on GI involvement, hereditary polyps necessitate total abdominoperineal resection with a permanent ileostomy, subtotal colectomy with ileoproctostomy, or ileoanal anastomosis. Juvenile polyps\\nare prone to autoamputation; if this doesn't occur, snare removal during colonoscopy is the treatment of choice. Special considerations During diagnostic evaluation: Check sodium, potassium, and chloride levels daily in the patient with fluid imbalances; adjust fluid and electrolytes, as necessary. Administer normal saline solution with potassium I.V., as ordered. Weigh the patient daily, and record the amount of diarrhea. Watch for signs of dehydration (decreased urine and increased blood urea nitrogen levels). Tell the patient to watch for and report evidence of rectal bleeding. After biopsy and fulguration: Check for signs of perforation and hemorrhage, such as sudden hypotension, a decrease in hemoglobin level or hematocrit, shock, abdominal pain, and passage of red blood through the rectum. Have the patient walk as soon as possible after the procedure. Watch for and record the first bowel movement, which may not occur for 2 to 3 days. Provide sitz baths for 3 days. If the patient has benign polyps, stress the need for routine follow-up studies to check the polypoid growth rate. Prepare the patient with precancerous or familial lesions for abdominoperineal resection. Provide emotional support and preoperative instruction. After ileostomy or subtotal colectomy with ileoproctostomy: Properly care for abdominal dressings, I.V. lines, and indwelling urinary catheters. Record intake and output, and check the patient's vital signs for hypotension and surgical complications. Administer pain medication, as ordered. To prevent embolism, have the patient walk\\nas soon as possible, and apply antiembolism stockings; encourage range-of-motion exercises. Provide enterostomal therapy and teach the patient stoma care. Pilonidal disease P 4 In pilonidal disease, a coccygeal cyst forms in the intergluteal cleft on the posterior surface of the lower sacrum. It usually contains hair and becomes infected, producing an abscess, a draining sinus, or a fistula. Incidence is highest among hirsute white men ages 18 to 30. Causes and incidence Pilonidal disease may develop congenitally from a tendency to hirsutism, or it may be acquired from stretching or irritation of the sacrococcygeal area (intergluteal fold) from prolonged\\nrough exercise (such as horseback riding), heat, excessive perspiration, or constrictive clothing. The incidence rate of pilonidal disease is 0.7%. It affects men two to four times more often than women, but the onset is earlier in females, possibly because they begin puberty at an earlier age. Complications Impaired social interaction due to pain and discomfort Difficulty performing work-related activities Signs and symptoms Generally, a pilonidal cyst produces no symptoms until it\\nbecomes infected, causing local pain, tenderness, swelling, or heat. Other clinical features include continuous or intermittent purulent drainage, followed by development of an abscess, chills, fever, headache, and malaise. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Physical examination confirms the diagnosis and may reveal a series of openings along the midline, with thin, brown, foul-smelling drainage or a protruding tuft of hair. Pressure on the sinus tract may produce purulent drainage. Passing a probe back through the sinus tract toward the sacrum\\nshouldn't reveal a perforation between the anterior sinus and anal canal. Cultures of discharge from the infected sinus may show staphylococci or skin bacteria, but don't usually contain bowel bacteria. Treatment Conservative treatment of pilonidal disease consists of incision and drainage of abscesses, regular extraction of protruding hairs, and sitz baths (four to six times daily). However, persistent infections may necessitate surgical excision of the entire affected area. After excision of a pilonidal abscess, the patient requires regular follow- up care to monitor wound healing. The surgeon may periodically palpate the wound during healing with a cotton-tipped applicator, curette excess granulation tissue, and extract loose hairs to promote wound healing from the inside out and to prevent dead cells from collecting in the wound. Complete healing may take several months. Special considerations Care includes preoperative and postoperative support and patient education. Before incision and drainage of a pilonidal abscess, assure the patient that he'll receive adequate pain relief. After surgery, check the compression dressing for signs of excessive bleeding, and change the dressing as directed. Encourage the patient to walk as soon as possible after the procedure. Tell the patient to place a gauze pad over\\nthe wound site after the dressing is removed to allow ventilation and prevent friction from clothing. Advise him to continue taking sitz baths\\nand to let the area air-dry instead of rubbing or patting it dry with a\\ntowel. After healing, the patient should briskly wash the area daily with a washcloth to remove loose hairs. Encourage the obese patient to establish a weight loss plan. Rectal prolapse Rectal prolapse is the circumferential protrusion of one or more layers of the mucous membrane through the anus. Prolapse may be complete (with displacement of the anal sphincter or bowel herniation) or partial (mucosal layer). (See Types of rectal prolapse .) Causes and incidence Rectal prolapse usually occurs in children younger than age 6 and in adults in their 60s and 70s. It's commonly associated with other conditions, such as pinworms (enterobiasis), whipworm infection (trichuriasis), cystic fibrosis, malnutrition and malabsorption (such as celiac disease), constipation, and previous trauma to the anus or pelvic area. True incidence figures are unavailable because many cases\\ngo unreported. Females are affected more often than males, accounting for 80% to 90% of reported cases. Complications Rectal ulceration Bleeding Incontinence Signs and symptoms In rectal prolapse, protrusion of tissue from the rectum may occur during defecation or walking. Other symptoms include a persistent sensation of rectal fullness, bloody diarrhea, pain in the lower abdomen due to ulceration, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and\\nrectal incontinence. Hemorrhoids or rectal polyps may coexist with a prolapse. Diagnosis Typical clinical features and visual examination confirm the diagnosis. In complete prolapse, examination reveals the full thickness of the bowel wall and, possibly, the sphincter muscle protruding and mucosa falling into bulky, concentric folds. In partial prolapse, examination reveals only partially protruding mucosa and a smaller mass of radial mucosal P folds. Straining during examination may disclose the full extent of prolapse. TYPES OF RECTAL PROLAPSE Partial rectal prolapse involves only the rectal mucosa and a small mass of radial mucosal folds. However, in complete rectal prolapse (also known as procidentia ), the full rectal wall, sphincter muscle, and a large mass of concentric mucosal folds protrude. Ulceration is possible after complete prolapse. Treatment In some cases, eliminating the underlying cause is the only treatment necessary. The rectal mucosa can be returned to the rectum manually. While the patient is in a knee-chest position, a soft, warm, wet cloth may be used to apply gentle pressure to the mass to push\\nit back through the anal opening, thereby allowing gravity to help return the prolapse into place. In a child, prolapsed tissue usually diminishes as the child grows. In an older patient, injection of a sclerosing agent to cause P a fibrotic reaction fixes the rectum in place.\\nSevere or chronic prolapse requires surgical repair by strengthening or\\ntightening the sphincters with wire or by anterior or rectal resection of prolapsed tissue. Special considerations Provide the patient with education regarding underlying causes and preoperative and postoperative support. PREVENTION Help the patient prevent constipation by teaching her the correct diet and stool-softening regimen. Advise the patient with severe prolapse and incontinence to wear a perineal pad. Before surgery, explain possible complications, including permanent rectal incontinence. After surgery, watch for immediate complications (hemorrhage) and later ones (pelvic abscess, fever, pus drainage, pain, rectal stenosis, constipation, or pain on defecation). Teach perineal strengthening exercises: Have the patient lie down, with her back flat on the mattress; then ask her to pull in her abdomen and squeeze while taking a deep breath; or have the patient repeatedly squeeze and relax her buttocks while sitting on a chair. Anal fissure Anal fissure is a laceration or crack in the lining of the anus that extends to the circular muscle. Most fissures heal on their own and don't require treatment, aside from good diaper hygiene. However, some fissures may require medical treatment. The prognosis is very good, especially with fissurectomy and good anal hygiene. Causes and incidence Anal fissure results from passage of large, hard stools that stretch the lining beyond its limits. It may also be due to prolonged diarrhea, strain on the perineum during childbirth and, rarely, from scar stenosis. Occasionally, anal fissure is secondary to proctitis, anal tuberculosis, cancer, or Crohn's disease. Anal fissures are common in young infants but may occur at any age, with incidence decreasing rapidly with age. Studies suggest that 80% of infants will have had an anal fissure by age 1. Fissures are\\nless common among school-age children than infants. They affect males and females equally. Complications Abscess, fistula, and septicemia (rare) Scar tissue Hampered bowel elimination Signs and symptoms Onset of an acute anal fissure is characterized by tearing, cutting, or burning pain during or immediately after a bowel movement. A few drops of blood may streak toilet paper or underclothes. Painful anal sphincter spasms result from ulceration of a \\u201csentinel pile\\u201d (swelling at the lower end of the fissure). A fissure may heal spontaneously and completely or it may partially heal and break open again. Chronic fissure produces scar tissue that hampers normal bowel evacuation. Diagnosis Anoscopy showing a longitudinal tear and typical clinical\\nfeatures help establish the diagnosis. Digital examination that elicits\\npain and bleeding supports the diagnosis. Gentle traction on perianal skin can create sufficient eversion to visualize the fistula directly. Treatment Treatment varies according to the severity of the tear. Conservative treatment measures include stool softeners, dietary adjustment (addition of bulk to absorb water while in the intestinal tract), use of petroleum jelly and sitz baths, and cleaning more gently.\\nAnesthetic P ointment may be useful if pain interferes with normal bowel movements. Topical muscle relaxants may also be soothing. These measures\\ngenerally heal more than 90% of anal fissures. For fissures that don't heal with these treatments, injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter will temporarily paralyze the anal sphincter muscle, thereby promoting healing. Another option for nonhealing fissures is a minor surgical procedure to relax the sphincter. For superficial fissures without hemorrhoids, forcible digital dilatation of the anal sphincter under local anesthesia stretches the lower portion of the sphincter. For complicated fissures, treatment includes surgical excision of tissue, adjacent skin, and mucosal tags and division of hypertrophied internal sphincter muscle to release tension. Special considerations Care consists of patient education and support. Prepare the patient for rectal examination; explain the necessity for the procedure. Provide warm sitz baths, warm soaks, and local anesthetic ointment to relieve pain. A low-residue diet, adequate fluid intake, and stool softeners prevent straining during defecation. Give diphenoxylate or other antidiarrheals to control diarrhea. Pruritus ani Pruritus ani is perianal itching, irritation, or superficial burning. This disorder is more common in men and boys than in women and girls. Causes and incidence Factors that contribute to pruritus ani include overcleaning of the perianal area (harsh soap, vigorous rubbing with a washcloth or toilet paper); minor trauma caused by straining to defecate; poor hygiene; sensitivity to spicy foods, coffee, alcohol, food preservatives, perfumed or colored toilet paper, detergents, or certain fabrics; specific medications (antibiotics, antihypertensives, or antacids that cause diarrhea); excessive sweating (in occupations associated with physical labor or high stress levels); anal skin tags; systemic disease, especially diabetes; skin disorders, such as psoriasis\\nor eczema; certain skin lesions, such as those associated with squamous\\ncell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, Paget's disease,\\nmelanoma, syphilis, and tuberculosis; fungal or parasitic infection; and local anorectal disease (fissure, hemorrhoids, and fistula). Signs and symptoms The key symptom of pruritus ani is perianal itching or burning after a bowel movement, during stress, or at night. In acute pruritus ani, scratching produces reddened skin, with weeping excoriations; in chronic pruritus ani, skin becomes thick and leathery, with excessive pigmentation. Diagnosis A detailed patient history is essential. Rectal examination rules out fissures and fistulas; biopsy rules out cancer. Allergy testing may also be helpful. Treatment After elimination of the underlying cause, treatment is symptomatic, such as advising the patient to avoid scratching or rubbing\\nthe itchy areas. Lukewarm baths and a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath may be comforting. Temporary relief may be obtained with\\ncold compresses. Topical over-the-counter ointments or creams containing hydrocortisone or zinc oxide are also useful. Special considerations Make sure that the patient understands his condition and the causes. Recommend keeping fingernails short to avoid skin damage from inadvertent scratching. Suggest using cool, light, loose bedclothes and avoiding wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over the irritated area. P Advise the patient to avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity. Advise the patient to avoid selfprescribed\\ncreams or powders, perfumed soaps, colored toilet paper, and moistened wipes because they may be irritating. Teach the patient to keep the perianal area clean and dry. Suggest witch hazel pads for wiping and cotton balls\\ntucked between the buttocks to absorb moisture. Proctitis Proctitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the rectal mucosa. It can result in discomfort, bleeding, and possibly a discharge of mucus or pus. Causes and incidence Proctitis caused by sexually transmitted disease (STD) occurs with high frequency among individuals who engage in anal intercourse. STDs that can cause proctitis include gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Amebiasis can also cause proctitis and can be transmitted by anal-oral sex. In children, beta-hemolytic streptococcus may cause proctitis. Autoimmune proctitis is associated with such diseases as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Proctitis may also be caused by medications, radiation, or noxious agents such as chemicals inserted into the rectum. Other contributing factors include chronic constipation, habitual laxative use, emotional upset, radiation (especially for cancer\\nof the cervix or uterus), endocrine dysfunction, rectal injury, rectal medications, bacterial infections, allergies (especially to milk), vasomotor disturbance that interferes with normal muscle control, and food poisoning. Signs and symptoms Key symptoms include tenesmus, constipation, a feeling of rectal fullness, and abdominal cramps on the left side. The patient feels an intense urge to defecate, which produces a small amount of stool that may contain blood and mucus. Diagnosis A detailed patient history is essential. In acute proctitis, sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy reveal edematous, bright red or pink rectal mucosa that's thick, shiny, friable and, possibly, ulcerated. In chronic proctitis, sigmoidoscopy shows thickened mucosa, loss of vascular pattern, and stricture of the rectal lumen. Other supportive tests include biopsy to rule out cancer as well as rectal culture and examination of a stool sample. Treatment Primary treatment eliminates the underlying cause (fecal impaction, laxatives, or other medications). Proctitis caused by infection is treated with antibiotics specific for the causative organism. Corticosteroids or mesalamine suppositories may relieve symptoms in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Soothing enemas or steroid (hydrocortisone) suppositories or enemas may be helpful if proctitis is due to radiation. Tranquilizers may be appropriate for the patient with emotional stress. Special considerations Tell the patient to watch for and report bleeding and other persistent symptoms. Fully explain proctitis and its treatment to the patient to help him understand the disorder and prevent its recurrence. Offer explanations, emotional support, and reassurance during rectal examinations and treatment.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction The liver is the largest internal organ in the body, weighing slightly more than 3 lb (1,200 to 1,600 g) in the average adult. It's also one of the busiest, performing well over 100 separate functions. The most important of these are the formation and secretion of bile; detoxification of harmful substances; storage of vitamins; metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; and production of plasma proteins. This remarkably resilient organ serves as the body's warehouse and is essential to life. Lobular structure Located above the right kidney, stomach, pancreas, and intestines and immediately below the diaphragm, the liver divides into a\\nleft and a right lobe separated by the falciform ligament. The right lobe is six times larger than the left. Glisson's capsule, a network of connective tissue, covers the entire organ and extends into the parenchyma along blood vessels and bile ducts. Within the parenchyma, cylindrical lobules comprise the basic functional units of the liver, consisting of cellular plates that radiate from a central vein, somewhat\\nlike spokes in a wheel. Small bile canaliculi fit between the cells in the plates and empty into terminal bile ducts, which join two larger ones that merge into a single hepatic duct upon leaving the liver. The hepatic duct then joins the cystic duct to form the common bile duct. The liver receives blood from two major sources: the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The two vessels carry approximately 1,500 ml of blood to the liver per minute, nearly 75% of which is supplied by the portal vein. Sinusoids \\u2014 offshoots of the hepatic artery\\nand portal vein \\u2014 run between each row of hepatic cells. Phagocytic Kupffer's cells, part of the reticuloendothelial system, line the sinusoids, destroying old or defective red blood cells and detoxifying harmful substances. The liver has a large lymphatic supply; consequently, cancer frequently metastasizes there. Liver function One of the liver's most important functions is the conversion of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, into bile. Liberated by the spleen into plasma and bound loosely to albumin, bilirubin reaches the liver in an unconjugated (water-insoluble) state. The liver then conjugates or dissociates it, converting it to a water-soluble derivative before excreting it as bile. All hepatic cells continually form bile. The liver also detoxifies many substances through inactivation or through conjugation. Inactivation involves reduction, oxidation, and hydroxylation. An important liver function is the inactivation of many drugs that are metabolized primarily in the liver. Such drugs must be used with caution in hepatic disease because their effects may be markedly prolonged. ELDER TIP In elderly people, the blood supply to the liver decreases, and certain liver enzymes become less active. As\\na result, the liver loses some of its ability to metabolize drugs, and higher levels of drugs remain in the circulation, causing more intense drug effects. This increases the risk of drug toxicity. As still another example of its amazing versatility, the liver forms vitamin A from certain vegetables and stores vitamins K, D, and B 12 . It also stores iron in the form of ferritin. Metabolic functions The liver figures indispensably in the metabolism of the three major food groups: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. In carbohydrate metabolism, the liver plays one of its most vital roles by extracting excess glucose from the blood and reserving it for times when\\nblood glucose levels fall below normal, when it releases glucose into the circulation, and then replenishes the supply by a process called glyconeogenesis. To prevent dangerously low blood glucose levels, the liver can also convert galactose or amino acids into glucose (gluconeogenesis). The liver also forms many critical chemical compounds\\nfrom the intermediate products of carbohydrate metabolism. The liver performs more than half the body's preliminary breakdown of fats because liver cells metabolize fats more quickly and efficiently than do other body cells. Liver cells break fats down into glycerol and fatty acids and convert the fatty acids into small molecules that can be oxidized. The liver also produces substantial quantities of cholesterol and phospholipids, manufactures lipoproteins, and synthesizes fat from carbohydrates and proteins to be transported in\\nlipoproteins for eventual storage in adipose tissue. Like so many of its functions, the liver's role in protein metabolism is essential to life. The liver deaminates amino acids so they can be used for energy or converted into fats or carbohydrates. It forms urea to remove ammonia from body fluids and forms all plasma proteins (as much as 50 to 100 g/day) except gamma globulin. The liver is such an effective synthesizer of protein that it can replenish as much as half its plasma proteins in 4 to 7 days. The liver also synthesizes nonessential amino acids and forms other important chemical compounds from amino acids. Production of plasma proteins The liver synthesizes most of the body's large molecules of plasma proteins, including all of the albumin, which binds many substances in plasma and maintains colloid osmotic pressure. Normally, plasma proteins and amino acid levels maintain equilibrium in the blood. When amino acid levels decrease, P the plasma proteins split into amino acids to restore this equilibrium. Reacting to decreased levels of amino acids, the liver steps up production of the plasma proteins. The liver may synthesize approximately 400 g of protein daily; for this reason, significant liver damage leads to hyperproteinemia, which in turn disrupts the colloid osmotic pressure and amino acid levels. The liver also produces most of the plasma proteins necessary for blood coagulation, including prothrombin and fibrinogen, which are the most abundant. The liver forms prothrombin in a process dependent on vitamin K and the production of bile. Fibrinogen, a large-molecule protein formed entirely by the liver, is an essential factor in the coagulation cascade. Together, the plasma proteins maintain colloid osmotic pressure throughout the capillaries. Because the plasma protein molecules are too large to cross the capillary membrane, they concentrate at the capillary line and produce an osmotic pressure of pull. This constant colloid osmotic pressure at the arteriolar and venular sections of the capillary provides the major osmotic force regulating the return of fluid to the intravascular compartment. Because of their large molecular size, the plasma proteins don't easily cross into the interstitial spaces. Their only route for return to the bloodstream is through lymphatic drainage. The lymphatic vessels drain into the lymphatic and thoracic ducts, which drain directly into the superior vena cava. Assessing for liver disease In many cases, a careful physical examination and patient\\nhistory can detect hepatic disease. Watch especially for its cardinal signs: jaundice (a result of increased serum bilirubin levels), ascites (commonly with hemoconcentration, edema, and oliguria), and hepatomegaly. Other signs and symptoms may include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, lassitude, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. To detect hepatomegaly, palpate the liver's left lobe, in the epigastrium between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus. Another primary sign is portal hypertension (portal vein pressure greater than 6 to 12 cm H 2 O)\\nrevealed by auscultation of a venous hum over the patient's abdomen. Surgical insertion of a catheter into the portal vein allows measurement\\nof portal vein pressure. ALERT Carefully assess the patient's neurologic status because neurologic symptoms, such as those associated with hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, muscle tremors, and asterixis), may signal the onset of life-threatening hepatic failure. Other common signs of hepatic disease include pallor (commonly linked to cirrhosis or carcinoma), parotid gland enlargement (in alcohol- induced liver damage), Dupuytren's contracture, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, decreased axillary or pubic hair, bleeding disorders (ecchymosis and purpura), spider angiomas, and palmar\\nerythema. Careful abdominal palpation and auscultation can also detect hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis, which turns the liver rock-hard and causes abdominal bruits. In hepatitis, the liver is usually enlarged; palpation may elicit tenderness at the liver's edge. In cirrhosis, the atrophic liver is difficult to palpate. In neoplastic disease or hepatic abscess, auscultation may detect a pleural friction rub. Comprehensive history essential Ask if the patient has ever had jaundice, anemia, or a splenectomy. Ask about occupational or other exposure to toxins (carbon tetrachloride, beryllium, or vinyl chloride), which may predispose him to hepatic disease. Consider recent travel or contact with persons who have traveled to areas where hepatic disease is endemic. Make sure to ask about alcohol consumption, a significant\\nfactor in suspected hepatic disease. Remember, an alcoholic may deliberately underestimate his alcohol intake, so interview the patient's family as well. Ask about recent contact with a jaundiced person and about any recent blood or plasma transfusions, blood tests, body piercings, tattoos, or dental work. Find out if the patient takes any drugs that may cause liver damage, such as sedatives, tranquilizers,\\nanalgesics, and P diuretics that cause potassium loss. Ask if the onset of symptoms was abrupt or insidious or if it followed abdominal injury that could have damaged the liver. Ask if the patient bruises or bleeds easily. Check the color of stools and urine, and ask about any change in bowel habits. Also ask if the patient's weight has fluctuated recently. Liver function studies Numerous tests are available to detect hepatic disease. Perhaps the most useful tests are liver function studies, which measure serum enzymes and other substances. Typical findings in hepatic disease include: increased bilirubin levels increased alkaline phosphatase and 5\\u2032-nucleotidase levels elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT): possible hepatocellular damage, viral hepatitis, or acute hepatic necrosis elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase levels:\\nespecially helpful because this enzyme level rises even when hepatic damage is still minimal hypoalbuminemia: subacute or massive hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis hyperglobulinemia: chronic inflammatory disorders prolonged prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time: hepatitis or cirrhosis elevated serum ammonia levels: hepatic encephalopathy decreased serum total cholesterol levels: liver disease positive lupus erythematosus cell test (in chronic active hepatitis and the presence of hepatitis B antigen). Liver function studies are less reliable after liver trauma. For instance, tests done long after the injury might miss an initial rise in serum AST and ALT levels. Several less specific blood tests for detecting hepatic disease are urine urobilinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and ornithine carbamoyltransferase. Other useful diagnostic tests include the following: Plain abdominal X-rays may indicate gross hepatomegaly and hepatic masses by elevation or distortion of the diaphragm and may show calcification in the gallbladder, biliary tree, pancreas, and liver. Barium studies may indicate an elevated left hepatic lobe by displacing the barium-filled stomach laterally and posteriorly. Oral cholecystography is useful because parenchymal dysfunction and impaired bile excretion decrease the excretion of the contrast material and prevent visualization of the gallbladder. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography distinguishes mechanical biliary obstruction from intrahepatic cholestasis. Angiography demonstrates hepatic arterial circulation (altered in cirrhosis) and helps diagnose primary or secondary hepatic tumor masses. Radioisotope liver scans (scintiscans) may\\nshow an area of decreased uptake (a \\u201chole\\u201d) using a colloidal or bengal\\nscan or an area of increased uptake (a \\u201chot spot\\u201d) using a gallium scan\\nin hepatoma or hepatic abscess. Computed tomography scan produces in-depth, three-dimensional images of the biliary tract (the liver as well as the pancreas) that help distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive jaundice and also helps identify space-occupying hepatic lesions. Portal and hepatic vein manometry localizes obstructions in the extrahepatic portion of the portal vein and portal inflow system or increased pressure in the presinusoidal vessels. Percutaneous or transvenous liver biopsy can determine the cause of unexplained hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly,\\ncholestasis, or persistently abnormal liver function tests; it's also useful when systemic infiltrative disease (such as sarcoidosis) or primary or metastatic hepatic tumors are suspected. Laparoscopy visualizes the serosal lining,\\nliver, gallbladder, spleen, and other organs and is useful in unexplained hepatomegaly, ascites, P or an abdominal mass. Gallbladder anatomy The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies in the fossa on the underside of the liver and is capable of holding 50 ml of bile. Attached to the large organ above by connective tissue, the peritoneum, and blood vessels, the gallbladder is divided into four parts: the fundus, or broad inferior end; the body, which is funnel-shaped and bound to the duodenum; the neck, which empties into the cystic duct; and the infundibulum, which lies between the body and the neck and sags to form Hartmann's pouch. The hepatic artery supplies the cystic and hepatic ducts with blood, which drains out of the gallbladder through the cystic vein. Rich lymph vessels in the submucosal layer also drain the gallbladder as well as the head of the pancreas. The biliary duct system provides a passage for bile from the liver to the intestine and regulates bile flow. The gallbladder itself collects, concentrates, and stores bile. The normally functioning\\ngallbladder also removes water and electrolytes from hepatic bile, increases the concentration of the larger solutes, and reduces its pH to\\nless than 7. In gallbladder disease, bile becomes more alkaline, altering bile salts and cholesterol and predisposing the organ to stone formation. Mechanisms of contraction The gallbladder responds to sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Sympathetic stimulation inhibits muscle contraction, mild vagal stimulation causes the gallbladder to contract and the sphincter of Oddi to relax, and stronger stimulation causes the sphincter to contract. The gallbladder also responds to substances released by the intestine. For instance, after chyme (semiliquid, partially digested food) enters the duodenum from the stomach, the duodenum releases cholecystokinin (CCK) and pancreozymin (PCZ) into the bloodstream and stimulates the gallbladder to contract. The gallbladder also produces secretin, which stimulates the liver to secrete bile and CCK-PCZ. The gallbladder may also respond to some type of hormonal control, a theory based in part on the fact that the gallbladder empties\\nmore slowly during pregnancy. Assessing for gallbladder disease During your physical examination of a patient with suspected gallbladder disease, look for its telltale signs and symptoms:\\npain, jaundice (a result of blockage of the common bile duct), fever, chills, indigestion, nausea, and intolerance of fatty foods. Pain may range from vague discomfort (as when pressure within the common bile duct gradually increases) to deep visceral pain (as when the gallbladder\\nsuddenly distends). Abrupt onset of pain with epigastric distress indicates gallbladder inflammation or obstruction of bile outflow by a stone or spasm. The onset of jaundice also varies. If the gallbladder is healthy, jaundice may be delayed several days after bile duct blockage; if the gallbladder is absent or diseased, jaundice may appear within 24 hours after the blockage. Other effects of obstruction\\u2014pruritus, steatorrhea, and bleeding tendencies \\u2014 may accompany jaundice. Gallbladder disorders rarely cause internal bleeding, but when they do\\u2014as in cholecystitis or obstructive clots in the biliary tree from GI bleeding \\u2014 they can be fatal. Diagnostic tests After taking a thorough patient history and carefully assessing the clinical features, the next step in accurate diagnosis of gallbladder disease is cholecystography, in which X-rays are taken of the gallbladder after the patient has ingested radiopaque dye. However, visualization depends on absorption of the dye from the small intestine,\\nthe liver's capacity to remove the dye from the blood and excrete it in\\nbile, the patency of the ductal system, and the ability of the gallbladder to concentrate and store the dye. Normally, the gallbladder fills about 13 hours after ingestion of the dye. Presence of stones or failure to visualize the gallbladder is significant. Other diagnostic tests for gallbladder disease include the following: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography differentiates extrahepatic from intrahepatic obstructive jaundice and helps detect biliary masses and calculi. Needle insertion in a bile duct\\npermits withdrawal of bile and injection of dye. Fluoroscopic tests evaluate P the filling of the hepatic and biliary trees. The test also permits palliative internal or external placement of biliary catheters for free flow of bile. Duodenal drainage diagnoses cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, biliary obstruction, hepatic cirrhosis, and pancreatic disease and differentiates types of jaundice. A tube is passed through the GI tract into the duodenum, and CCK-PCZ is given to stimulate the gallbladder, permitting measurement of bile flow and also specimen collection, which is examined for mucus, blood, cholesterol crystals, pancreatic enzymes, cancer cells, bacteria, or calcium bilirubinate. Duodenal drainage is especially useful when gallbladder function is poor or absent, when cholecystography fails to visualize the gallbladder or yields negative results despite continuing symptoms, or when cholecystography is contraindicated because of the patient's condition. In endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, duodenal endoscopy with dye injection and fluoroscopy are used to cannulate and visualize biliary and pancreatic ducts. This test is useful in locating obstruction, calculi, carcinoma, or stricture and for obtaining bile or pancreatic juice for analysis. Internal stents can be inserted to allow free flow of bile or pancreatic\\njuice. In gallbladder ultrasound, sound waves are\\nused to visualize the gallbladder and locate obstruction, stones, and tumors. This test is 95% accurate in detecting stones. Other appropriate tests for biliary disease are the same as those for hepatic disease. LIVER DISORDERS Viral hepatitis Viral hepatitis is a fairly common systemic disease, marked by hepatic cell destruction, necrosis, and autolysis, leading to anorexia, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. In most patients, hepatic cells eventually regenerate with little or no residual damage. However, old age and serious underlying disorders make complications more likely. The\\nprognosis is poor if edema and hepatic encephalopathy develop. Hepatitis occurs in these forms: Type A (infectious or short-incubation hepatitis) is an acute-onset infection and most often affects children and young adults. Type B (serum or long-incubation hepatitis) is an insidious-onset infection and affects all age groups. Routine screening of donor blood for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has decreased the incidence of posttransfusion cases, but transmission by needles shared by drug abusers remains a major problem. Type C accounts for about 20% of all viral hepatitis cases and for most posttransfusion cases. Type D (delta hepatitis) is responsible for about 50% of all cases of fulminant hepatitis, which has a high mortality. Developing in 1% of patients, fulminant hepatitis causes unremitting liver failure with encephalopathy. It progresses to coma and\\ncommonly leads to death within 2 weeks. In the United States, type D is\\nconfined to people who are frequently exposed to blood and blood products, such as I.V. drug users and patients with hemophilia. Type E (formerly grouped with type C under\\nthe name non-A, non-B hepatitis) occurs primarily among patients who have recently returned from an endemic area (such as India, Africa, Asia, or Central America); it's more common in young adults and more severe in pregnant women. Hepatitis G is a newly discovered form of hepatitis. Transmission is by the blood-borne route and it's more common\\nin those who receive blood transfusions. Causes and incidence The major forms of viral hepatitis result from infection with the causative viruses: A, B, C, D, E, or G. Type A hepatitis is highly contagious and is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route. However, it may also be transmitted\\nparenterally, sexually (especially with oral or anal contact) and perinatally. Hepatitis P A usually results from ingestion of contaminated food, milk, or water. Many outbreaks of this type are traced to ingestion of seafood from polluted water. In 2004, there were more than 5,000 acute cases of hepatitis A infection reported in the United States. Type B hepatitis, once thought to be transmitted only by the direct exchange of contaminated blood, is now known to be transmitted also by contact with human secretions and feces. As a result, nurses, physicians, laboratory technicians, and dentists are frequently exposed to type B hepatitis, in many cases as a result of wearing defective gloves. Transmission also occurs during intimate sexual contact as well as through perinatal transmission. An estimated 50,000 new cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 5,000 deaths from HBV occurred in the United States in 2004. Although specific type C hepatitis viruses have been isolated, only a small percentage of patients have tested positive for them\\u2014perhaps reflecting the test's poor specificity. Usually, this type of hepatitis is transmitted through transfused blood from asymptomatic donors. Hepatitis C accounted for 26,000 new infections and 8,000 to 10,000 deaths in the United States in 2004. Most exposures (60%) occur through the use of illicit I.V. drugs. However, sexual transmission is responsible for 20% of cases. More than 170 million people have the hepatitis C virus worldwide. Type D hepatitis is found only in patients with an acute or chronic episode of hepatitis B and requires the presence of HBsAg. The type D virus depends on the double-shelled type B virus to replicate. For this reason, type D infection can't outlast a type B infection. About 15 million people are infected with hepatitis D worldwide. It's more common in adults than in children. People with a history of illicit I.V. drug use and people who live in the Mediterranean basin have a higher incidence. Type E hepatitis is transmitted enterically, much like type A. Because this virus is inconsistently shed in feces, detection is\\ndifficult. In the United States, the prevalence of hepatitis E is less than 2%. It's typically found in developing countries that lie near the equator. Incidence is highest among people ages 15 to 40. Type G may be transmitted in a manner similar to that of hepatitis C. It may also be transmitted by sexual contact, and its incidence may be higher than previously suspected. It's associated with acute and chronic liver disease, but studies haven't clearly implicated the hepatitis G virus as an etiologic agent. Other proposed causative factors, such as non-ABCDE viral hepatitis and type F, are under investigation. Complications Chronic active hepatitis (with late hepatitis B) Primarily liver cancer (hepatitis B or C) Pancreatitis Cirrhosis Myocarditis Aplastic anemia Peripheral neuropathy Signs and symptoms Assessment findings are similar for the different types of hepatitis. Typically, signs and symptoms progress in several stages. In the prodromal (preicteric) stage, the patient typically complains of easy fatigue and anorexia (possibly with mild weight loss), generalized malaise, depression, headache, weakness, arthralgia, myalgia, photophobia, and nausea with vomiting. He also may describe changes in his senses of taste and smell. Assessment of the patient's vital signs may reveal a fever of 100\\u00b0 to 102\\u00b0 F (37.8\\u00b0 to 38.9\\u00b0 C). As the prodromal stage ends,\\nusually 1 to 5 days before the onset of the clinical jaundice stage, inspection of urine and stool specimens may reveal darkcolored urine and\\nclay-colored stools. If the patient has progressed to the clinical jaundice stage, he may report pruritus, abdominal pain or tenderness, and indigestion. Early in this stage, he may complain of anorexia; later, his appetite may return. P Inspection of the sclerae, mucous membranes, and skin may reveal jaundice, which can last for 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice indicates that the damaged liver is unable to remove bilirubin from the blood; however, its presence doesn't indicate the severity of the disease. Occasionally, hepatitis occurs without jaundice. During the clinical jaundice stage, inspection of the skin may detect rashes, erythematous patches, or urticaria, especially if the patient has hepatitis B or C. Palpation may disclose abdominal tenderness in the right upper quadrant, an enlarged and tender liver and, in some cases, splenomegaly and cervical adenopathy. During the recovery (posticteric) stage, most of the patient's symptoms decrease or subside. On palpation, a decrease in liver enlargement may be noted. The recovery phase commonly lasts from 2\\nto 12 weeks, although sometimes this phase lasts longer in the patient with hepatitis B, C, or E. Little is known about hepatitis G. Diagnosis A hepatitis profile, which identifies antibodies specific\\nto the causative virus and establishes the type of hepatitis, is routine in suspected viral hepatitis. Type A: Detection of an antibody to hepatitis A confirms the diagnosis. Type B: The presence of HBsAg and hepatitis B antibodies confirms the diagnosis. Type C: Diagnosis depends on serologic testing for the specific antibody 1 or more months after the onset of acute hepatitis. Until then, the diagnosis is established primarily by obtaining negative test results for hepatitis A, B, and D. Type D: Detection of intrahepatic delta antigens or immunoglobulin (Ig) antidelta antigens in acute disease (or IgM and IgG in chronic disease) establishes the diagnosis. Type E: Detection of hepatitis E antigens supports the diagnosis; however, the diagnosis may also be determined by\\nruling out hepatitis C. Type G: Detection of hepatitis G antigen supports the diagnosis but doesn't clearly implicate infection; the patient may be otherwise asymptomatic. Additional findings from liver function studies support the diagnosis: Serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum\\nalanine aminotransferase levels are increased in the prodromal stage of\\nacute viral hepatitis. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are slightly increased. Serum bilirubin levels are elevated. Levels may continue to be high late in the disease, especially in severe cases. Prothrombin time is prolonged (more than 3 seconds longer than normal indicates severe liver damage). White blood cell counts commonly reveal transient neutropenia and lymphopenia followed by lymphocytosis. Liver biopsy is performed if chronic hepatitis is suspected; however, it's performed for acute hepatitis only\\nif the diagnosis is questionable. Treatment No specific drug therapy has been developed for hepatitis, with the exception of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis B has been successfully treated with a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue called telbividine(Tyzeka). Hepatitis C has been treated somewhat successfully with interferon alfa-2b (Intron A) and peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys). Instead, patients are advised to rest in the early stages of the illness and to combat anorexia by eating small, high-calorie, high- protein meals. (Protein intake should be reduced if signs or symptoms of pre-coma\\u2014lethargy, confusion, and mental\\nchanges\\u2014develop.) Large meals are usually better tolerated in the morning because many patients experience nausea late in the day. In acute viral hepatitis, hospitalization usually is required only for the patient with severe symptoms or complications. Parenteral nutrition may be required if the patient experiences persistent vomiting and is unable to maintain oral intake. P Antiemetics may be given 30 minutes before meals to relieve nausea and prevent vomiting; phenothiazines have a cholestatic effect and should be avoided. For severe pruritus, the resin cholestyramine may be given. Special considerations Use enteric precautions when caring for patients with type A or E hepatitis. Practice standard precautions for all patients. Inform visitors about isolation precautions. Provide rest periods throughout the day. Schedule treatments and tests so that the patient can rest between bouts of activity. Because inactivity may make the patient anxious, include diversionary activities as part of his care. Gradually add activities to his schedule as he begins to recover. Encourage the patient to eat. Don't overload his meal tray or overmedicate him because this will diminish his appetite. Encourage fluids (at least 4 qt [4 L] per day). Encourage the anorectic patient to drink fruit juice. Also offer chipped ice and effervescent soft drinks to maintain hydration without inducing vomiting. Administer supplemental vitamins and commercial feedings, as ordered. If symptoms are severe and the patient can't tolerate oral intake, provide I.V. therapy and parenteral nutrition, as ordered by the physician. Record the patient's weight daily, and keep intake and output records. Observe stools for color, consistency, and amount and record the frequency of bowel movements. Watch for signs of fluid shift, such as weight gain and orthostasis. Watch for signs of hepatic coma, dehydration, pneumonia, vascular problems, and pressure ulcers. In fulminant hepatitis, maintain electrolyte balance and a patent airway, prevent infections, and control\\nbleeding. Correct hypoglycemia and other complications while awaiting liver regeneration and repair. Before discharge, emphasize the importance\\nof having regular medical checkups for at least 1 year. The patient will have an increased risk of developing hepatoma. Warn the patient against using alcohol or over- the-counter drugs during this period. Teach him to recognize the signs of a recurrence. Inform the patient about the availability of support groups for people with all types of hepatitis and provide contact information if he's interested. PREVENTION Review the following with your patient to prevent the spread of hepatitis: Stress the importance of thorough and frequent hand washing. Tell the patient not to share food, eating utensils, or toothbrushes. If the patient has hepatitis A or E, warn him not to contaminate food or water with fecal matter, because the disease is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. If the patient has hepatitis B, C, D, or G, explain that transmission occurs thorugh exchange of blood or body fluids that contain blood. While infected, he shouldn't donate blood or have sexual contact. Advise the patient to take extra care to avoid cutting himself. Nonviral hepatitis Nonviral inflammation of the liver is a form of hepatitis\\nthat is classified as toxic, drug-induced (idiosyncratic), or autoimmune. Most patients recover from this illness, although a few develop fulminating hepatitis or cirrhosis. Causes and incidence P Various hepatotoxins\\u2014carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, trichloroethylene, poisonous mushrooms, and vinyl chloride \\u2014can cause the toxic form of this disease. Following exposure to these agents, liver damage usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours, depending on the size\\nof the dose or degree of exposure. Alcohol, anoxia, and preexisting liver disease exacerbate the toxic effects of some of these agents. Drug-induced (idiosyncratic) hepatitis may stem from a hypersensitivity reaction unique to the affected individual, unlike toxic hepatitis, which appears to affect all people indiscriminately. Among the drugs that may cause this type of hepatitis are niacin, halothane, sulfonamides, isoniazid, methyldopa, and phenothiazines (cholestasis-induced hepatitis). In hypersensitive people, symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may appear at any time during or after exposure to these drugs but usually emerge after 2 to 5 weeks of therapy. Not all adverse drug reactions are toxic. Hormonal contraceptives, for example, may impair liver function and produce jaundice without causing necrosis,\\nfatty infiltration of liver cells, or hypersensitivity. Autoimmune hepatitis, also known as lupoid hepatitis, is a\\ndisease in which the body's immune system attacks liver cells, causing them to become inflamed. Researchers think a genetic factor may predispose some people to autoimmune diseases. About 70% of those with autoimmune hepatitis are women, most age 15 to 40. It's usually chronic and can lead to cirrhosis. Complications Cirrhosis Hepatitis Liver failure Signs and symptoms Clinical features of toxic and drug-induced hepatitis vary with the severity of the liver damage and the causative agent. In most patients, signs and symptoms resemble those of viral hepatitis: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, hepatomegaly, possible\\nabdominal pain (with acute onset and massive necrosis), and clay-colored stools or pruritus with the cholestatic form of hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride poisoning also produces headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and vasomotor collapse; halothane-related hepatitis produces\\nfever, moderate leukocytosis, and eosinophilia; chlorpromazine toxicity\\nproduces abrupt fever, rash, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and epigastric or right upper quadrant pain. Diagnosis Diagnostic findings include elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin (with cholestasis), alkaline phosphatase, white blood cell (WBC) count, and eosinophil count (possible in drug-induced type). To diagnose autoimmune hepatitis, antibodies, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), smooth muscle cells antibodies (SMA), or liver and kidney microsomes (anti-LKM), will be elevated. Liver biopsy may help identify the underlying pathology, especially infiltration with WBCs and eosinophils. Liver function tests have limited value in distinguishing between nonviral and viral hepatitis. Treatment Effective treatment must remove the causative agent by lavage, catharsis, or hyperventilation, depending on the route of exposure. Acetylcysteine (Acetadote) may serve as an antidote for toxic hepatitis caused by acetaminophen poisoning but doesn't prevent drug-induced hepatitis caused by other substances. Corticosteroids may be ordered for patients with the drug-induce and autoimmune type. Azathioprine (Imuran), an immune suppressant, may also be used in conjunction with corticosteroids to treat autoimmune hepatitis. Special considerations Monitor laboratory studies and note trends. Monitor the patient's vital signs and provide support to maintain vital functioning, depending on the severity of his symptoms. P Preventive measures should include instructing the patient about the proper use of drugs and the proper handling of cleaning agents and solvents. Cirrhosis and fibrosis Cirrhosis is a chronic hepatic disease characterized by diffuse destruction and fibrotic regeneration of hepatic cells. As necrotic tissue yields to fibrosis, this disease alters liver structure and normal vasculature, impairs blood and lymph flow, and ultimately causes hepatic insufficiency. The prognosis is better in noncirrhotic forms of hepatic fibrosis, which cause minimal hepatic dysfunction and don't destroy liver cells. Causes and incidence These clinical types of cirrhosis reflect its diverse etiology: Portal, nutritional, or alcoholic (Laennec's) cirrhosis, the most common type, occurs in 30% to 50% of cirrhotic patients, up to 90% of whom have a history of alcoholism. Liver damage results from malnutrition, especially of dietary protein, and chronic alcohol ingestion. Fibrous tissue forms in portal areas and around central veins. Biliary cirrhosis (15% to 20% of patients) results from injury or prolonged obstruction. Postnecrotic (posthepatic) cirrhosis (10% to 30% of patients) stems from various types of hepatitis. Pigment cirrhosis (5% to 10% of patients) may result from disorders such as hemochromatosis. Cardiac cirrhosis (rare) refers to liver damage caused by right-sided heart failure. Idiopathic cirrhosis (about 10% of patients) has no known cause. Noncirrhotic fibrosis may result from schistosomiasis or congenital hepatic fibrosis or may be idiopathic. Complications Portal hypertension Bleeding esophageal varices Hepatic encephalopathy Hepatorenal syndrome Signs and symptoms Clinical manifestations of cirrhosis and fibrosis are similar for all types, regardless of the cause. Early indications are vague, but usually include GI signs and symptoms (anorexia, indigestion,\\nnausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea) and a dull abdominal ache.\\nMajor and late signs and symptoms develop as a result of hepatic insufficiency and portal hypertension: Respiratory\\u2014pleural effusion and limited thoracic expansion due to abdominal ascites, interfering with efficient gas exchange and leading to hypoxia Central nervous system\\u2014progressive signs or symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy \\u2014lethargy, mental changes, slurred\\nspeech, asterixis (flapping tremor), peripheral neuritis, paranoia, hallucinations, extreme obtundation, and coma Hematologic\\u2014bleeding tendencies (nosebleeds, easy bruising, and bleeding gums) and anemia Endocrine\\u2014testicular atrophy, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia, and loss of chest and axillary hair Skin\\u2014severe pruritus, extreme dryness, poor tissue turgor, abnormal pigmentation, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and possibly jaundice Hepatic\\u2014jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, edema of the legs, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome comprise the other major effects of full-fledged cirrhosis Miscellaneous\\u2014musty breath, enlarged superficial abdominal veins, muscle atrophy, pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant that worsens when the patient sits up or leans forward, palpable liver or spleen, and temperature of 101\\u00b0 to 103\\u00b0 F (38.3\\u00b0 to 39.4\\u00b0 C). Bleeding from esophageal varices results from portal\\nhypertension. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Liver biopsy, the definitive test for cirrhosis, detects destruction and fibrosis of hepatic tissue. Liver scan shows abnormal thickening and a liver mass. Cholecystography and cholangiography visualize the gallbladder and the biliary duct system, respectively; splenoportal venography visualizes the portal venous system. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography differentiates extrahepatic from intrahepatic obstructive jaundice and discloses hepatic pathology and the presence of gallstones. Laboratory findings that are characteristic of cirrhosis include: decreased white blood cell count, hemoglobin level and hematocrit, albumin, serum electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium), and cholinesterase elevated levels of globulin, serum ammonia, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase and increased thymol turbidity anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, characterized by prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times deficiencies of folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, B 12 , C, and K. Treatment Treatment is designed to remove or alleviate the underlying cause of cirrhosis or fibrosis, prevent further liver damage,\\nand prevent or treat complications. The patient may benefit from a high-calorie and moderate-to high-protein diet, but developing hepatic encephalopathy mandates restricted protein intake. In addition, sodium is usually P restricted to 200 to 500 mg/day and fluids to 1 to 1\\u00bd qt (about 1 to 1.5 L)/day. If the patient's condition deteriorates, he may need tube\\nfeedings or total parenteral nutrition. He also may need supplemental vitamins\\u2014A, B complex, D, and K\\u2014to compensate for the liver's inability to store them and vitamin B 12 ,\\nfolic acid, and thiamine for deficiency anemia. Rest, moderate exercise, and avoidance of infections and toxic agents are essential. UNDERSTANDING PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ESOPHAGEAL VARICES Portal hypertension\\u2014elevated pressure in the portal vein \\u2014occurs when blood flow meets increased resistance. The disorder is a\\ncommon result of cirrhosis, but may also stem from mechanical obstruction and occlusion of the hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome). As portal pressure rises, blood backs up into the spleen and flows through collateral channels to the venous system, bypassing the liver. Consequently, portal hypertension produces splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia, dilated collateral veins (esophageal varices, hemorrhoids, or prominent abdominal veins), and ascites. Nevertheless, in many patients, the first sign of portal hypertension is bleeding from\\nesophageal varices\\u2014dilated tortuous veins in the submucosa of the lower\\nesophagus. Bleeding esophageal varices commonly cause massive hematemesis, requiring emergency treatment to control hemorrhage and prevent hypovolemic shock. Diagnosis and treatment These procedures help diagnose and correct esophageal varices. Endoscopy identifies the ruptured varix as the bleeding site and excludes other potential sources in the upper GI tract. Angiography may aid diagnosis, but is less precise than endoscopy. Vasopressin infused into the superior mesenteric artery may temporarily stop bleeding. When angiography is unavailable, vasopressin may be infused by I.V. drip or diluted with 5% dextrose in water (except in patients with coronary vascular disease), but this route is usually less effective. A Sengstaken-Blakemore or Minnesota tube may also help control hemorrhage by applying pressure on the bleeding site. Iced saline lavage through the tube may help control bleeding. The use of vasopressin or a Minnesota or Sengstaken- Blakemore tube is a temporary measure, especially in the patient with a severely deteriorated liver. Fresh blood and fresh frozen\\nplasma, if available, are preferred for blood transfusions to replace clotting factors. Treatment with lactulose promotes elimination of old blood from the GI tract, which combats excessive ammonia production and accumulation. Appropriate surgical bypass procedures include portosystemic anastomosis, splenorenal shunt, and mesocaval shunt. A portacaval or a mesocaval shunt decreases pressure within the liver and reduces ascites, plasma loss, and the risk of hemorrhage by directing blood from the liver into collateral vessels. Emergency shunts carry a mortality of 25% to 50%. Clinical evidence suggests that portosystemic bypass doesn't prolong the patient's survival time; however, he will eventually die of hepatic coma rather than of hemorrhage. Patient care P Care for the patient who has portal hypertension with esophageal varices focuses on careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage and subsequent hypotension, compromised oxygen supply, and\\naltered level of consciousness (LOC). Monitor the patient's vital signs, urine output, and central venous pressure to determine fluid volume status. Assess the patient's LOC often. Provide emotional support and reassurance after massive GI bleeding, which is always frightening. Keep the patient as quiet and comfortable as possible, but remember that tolerance of sedatives and tranquilizers may be decreased because of liver damage. Clean the patient's mouth, which may be dry and flecked with dried blood. Carefully monitor the patient with a Minnesota or Sengstaken-Blakemore tube in place for persistent bleeding in gastric drainage, signs of asphyxiation from tube displacement, proper inflation of balloons, and correct traction to maintain tube placement. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY CIRCULATION IN PORTAL HYPERTENSION As portal vein pressure rises, blood backs up into the spleen and flows through collateral channels to the venous system, bypassing the liver and resulting in esophageal varices. Drug therapy requires special caution because the cirrhotic liver can't detoxify harmful substances efficiently. If required, vasopressin may be prescribed for esophageal varices, and diuretics may be given for edema. However, diuretics require careful monitoring because fluid and electrolyte imbalance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is treated with lactulose. Antibiotics are used to decrease intestinal bacteria and reduce ammonia production, which causes encephalopathy. Coagulopathy may be treated with blood products or vitamin K. Paracentesis and infusions of salt-poor albumin, in addition to fluid and salt restriction, may alleviate ascites. Surgical procedures include treatment of varices by upper endoscopy with banding or sclerosis, splenectomy, esophagogastric resection, and splenorenal or\\nportacaval P anastomosis to relieve portal hypertension. (See Understanding portal hypertension and esophageal varices and Circulation in portal hypertension. ) Low-protein diets are controversial. They aid in managing\\nacute hepatic encephalopathy but are rarely necessary in chronic conditions because of the underlying protein-calorie malnutrition. ALERT If cirrhosis progresses and becomes life-threatening, a liver transplant should be considered. Special considerations The patient with cirrhosis needs close observation, first-rate supportive care, and sound nutritional counseling. Check the patient's skin, gums, stools, and vomitus regularly for bleeding. Apply pressure to injection sites to\\nprevent bleeding. Warn him against taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, straining at stool, and blowing his nose or sneezing too vigorously. Suggest using an electric razor and soft toothbrush. ALERT Observe the patient closely for changes in behavior or personality. Report increasing stupor, lethargy, hallucinations, or neuromuscular dysfunction. Awaken him periodically to\\ndetermine his level of consciousness. Watch for asterixis, a sign of developing hepatic encephalopathy. To assess fluid retention, weigh the patient and measure abdominal girth at least daily, inspect his ankles and sacrum for dependent edema, and accurately record intake and output.\\nCarefully evaluate the patient before, during, and after paracentesis; this drastic loss of fluid may induce shock. To prevent skin breakdown associated with edema and pruritus, avoid using soap when you bathe the patient; instead, use lubricating lotion or moisturizing agents. Handle him gently, and turn and reposition him often to keep his skin intact. Tell the patient that rest and good nutrition will conserve his energy and decrease metabolic demands on the\\nliver. Urge him to eat frequent, small meals. Stress the need to avoid infections and abstain from alcohol. Refer him to Alcoholics Anonymous, if necessary. Liver abscess A liver abscess occurs when bacteria or protozoa destroy hepatic tissue, producing a cavity, which fills with infectious organisms, liquefied liver cells, and leukocytes. Necrotic tissue then walls off the cavity from the rest of the liver. Although liver abscess is relatively uncommon, it carries\\na mortality of 10% to 20%. Complications include rupture into the peritoneum, pleura, or pericardium, significantly increasing mortality. Causes and incidence In pyogenic liver abscesses, the common infecting organisms are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, and enterococcus. The infecting organisms may invade the liver directly after a liver wound or they may spread from the lungs, skin, or other organs by the hepatic artery, portal vein, or biliary tract. Pyogenic abscesses are generally multiple and commonly follow cholecystitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, and bacterial endocarditis. An amebic abscess results from infection with the protozoa Entamoeba histolytica, the organism that causes amebic dysentery. Amebic liver abscesses usually occur singly, in the right lobe. There are 8 to 16 cases of liver abscess for every 100,000 people hospitalized, and the mortality rate is 5% to 30%. Most cases occur in people in their 60s and 70s. Complication Abscess rupture into pleura, peritoneum, or pericardium P Signs and symptoms The clinical manifestations of a liver abscess depend on the degree of involvement. Some patients are acutely ill; in others, the\\nabscess is recognized only at autopsy, after death from another illness. The onset of symptoms of a pyogenic abscess is usually sudden; in an amebic abscess, the onset is more insidious. Common signs and symptoms include right abdominal and shoulder pain, weight loss, fever, chills, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and anemia. Signs of right pleural effusion, such as dyspnea and pleural pain, develop if the abscess extends through the diaphragm. Liver damage may cause jaundice. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast medium can accurately define intrahepatic lesions and assess intra-abdominal pathology. Percutaneous needle aspiration of the abscess can be performed to identify the causative organism. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast medium may also be accurate for diagnosing liver abscess, Relevant laboratory values include elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels; increased white blood cell count; and decreased serum albumin levels. In pyogenic abscess, a blood culture can identify the bacterial agent; in amebic abscess, a stool culture and serologic and hemagglutination tests can assist in diagnosis. Treatment If the organism causing the liver abscess is unknown, long-term antibiotic therapy begins immediately. When culture results are obtained, antibiotics are prescribed specific to treat the organism.\\nI.V. antibiotic therapy usually continues for 14 days and then is replaced with an oral preparation to complete a 6-week course. Surgery is usually avoided, but it may be done for a single pyogenic abscess or for an amebic abscess that fails to respond to antibiotics. Placement of\\ndrains (using CT scanning or ultrasound) particularly in large abscesses, reduces the need for abdominal surgery. In acutely toxic patients, percutaneous needle aspiration and decompression may be needed\\nto remove the abscess. Special considerations Provide supportive care, monitor the patient's vital signs (especially temperature), and maintain fluid and nutritional intake. Administer anti-infectives and antibiotics\\nas ordered, and watch for possible adverse effects. Stress the importance of compliance with therapy. Explain diagnostic and surgical procedures. Watch carefully for complications of abdominal surgery, such as hemorrhage or sepsis. Fatty liver Fatty liver, also known as steatosis, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is a common clinical finding consisting of accumulated triglycerides and other fats in liver cells. In severe fatty liver, fat comprises as much as 40% of the liver's weight (as opposed to 5% in a normal liver), and the weight of the liver\\nmay increase from 3.31 lb (1.5 kg) to as much as 11 lb (4.9 kg). Minimal fatty changes are temporary and asymptomatic; severe or persistent changes may cause liver dysfunction. Fatty liver is usually reversible by simply eliminating the cause; however, this disorder may result in recurrent infection or sudden death from fat emboli in the lungs. Causes and incidence Chronic alcoholism is the most common cause of fatty liver in the United States and in Europe, with the severity of hepatic disease directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed. (Fatty liver\\ncan occur in people who consume as little as 10 oz of alcohol per week.) P Other causes of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis include malnutrition (especially protein deficiency), obesity, diabetes mellitus, jejunoileal bypass surgery, Cushing's syndrome, Reye's syndrome, pregnancy, large doses of hepatotoxins such as I.V. tetracycline, carbon tetrachloride intoxication, prolonged parenteral nutrition, and DDT poisoning. Whatever the cause, fatty infiltration of the liver probably results from mobilization of fatty acids from adipose\\ntissues or altered fat metabolism. Complications Permanent liver damage Portal hypertension Metabolic disturbances Disseminated intravascular coagulation Renal failure Coma MASSIVE ASCITES IN FATTY LIVER Massive ascites may result from fatty liver. Emaciated extremities and upper thorax are also typical of ascites. Signs and symptoms Clinical features of fatty liver vary with the degree of lipid infiltration, and many patients are asymptomatic. The most typical\\nsign is a large, tender liver (hepatomegaly). Common signs and symptoms\\ninclude right upper quadrant pain (with massive or rapid infiltration),\\nascites, edema, jaundice, and fever (all with hepatic necrosis or biliary stasis). (See Massive ascites in fatty liver. )\\nNausea, vomiting, and anorexia are less common. Splenomegaly usually accompanies cirrhosis. Rarer changes are spider angiomas, varices, transient gynecomastia, and menstrual disorders. Diagnosis Typical clinical features\\u2014especially in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, or obesity\\u2014suggest fatty liver. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A liver biopsy confirms excessive fat in the liver. These liver function tests support this diagnosis: Albumin\\u2014somewhat low Globulin\\u2014usually elevated Cholesterol\\u2014usually elevated Total bilirubin\\u2014elevated Alkaline phosphatase\\u2014elevated Transaminase\\u2014elevated Prothrombin time\\u2014possibly prolonged. Other findings may include anemia, leukocytosis, elevated\\nwhite blood cell count, albuminuria, hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and\\niron, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 deficiencies. Treatment Treatment of fatty liver is essentially supportive and consists of correcting the underlying condition or eliminating its cause. For instance, when fatty liver results from parenteral nutrition,\\ndecreasing the rate of carbohydrate infusion may correct the disease. In alcoholic fatty liver, abstinence from alcohol and a proper diet can begin to correct liver changes within 4 to 8 weeks. Such correction requires comprehensive patient teaching. Special considerations Providing support to the patient and his family is an important element in the care of the patient with steatosis. Suggest counseling for the alcoholic patient and provide emotional support for his family. Teach the patient with diabetes\\u2014and his family\\u2014about proper care, such as the purpose of insulin injections, diet, and exercise. Refer him to home health nurses or to group classes,\\nas necessary, to promote compliance with treatment. Emphasize the need for long-term P medical supervision and urge him to report any changes in his health immediately. Instruct an obese patient and his family about proper diet. Warn against fad diets, which are usually nutritionally inadequate. Recommend medical supervision for a patient who's more than 20% overweight. Encourage attendance at group diet and exercise programs and, if necessary, suggest behavior modification programs to correct eating habits. Be sure to follow up on his progress and provide positive reinforcement for any weight loss. Assess for malnutrition, especially protein deficiency, in the patient with chronic illness. Suggest dietary\\nchanges and refer the patient to a dietitian. Advise patients receiving hepatotoxins and\\nthose who risk occupational exposure to DDT to watch for and immediately report signs of toxicity. Inform the patient that fatty liver is reversible only if he strictly follows the therapeutic program; otherwise, he risks permanent liver damage. Hepatic encephalopathy Hepatic encephalopathy, also known as portosystemic encephalopathy or hepatic coma, is a neurologic syndrome that develops as a complication of chronic liver disease. Most common in patients with cirrhosis, this syndrome is due primarily to ammonia intoxication of the brain. It may be acute and self-limiting or chronic and progressive. Treatment requires correction of the precipitating cause and reduction of blood ammonia levels. In advanced stages, the prognosis is extremely poor despite vigorous treatment. Causes and incidence Hepatic encephalopathy follows rising blood ammonia levels. Normally, the ammonia produced by protein breakdown in the bowel\\nis metabolized to urea in the liver. When portal blood shunts past the liver, ammonia directly enters the systemic circulation and is carried to the brain. Such shunting may result from the collateral venous circulation that develops in portal hypertension or from surgically created portosystemic shunts. Cirrhosis further compounds this problem because impaired hepatocellular function prevents conversion of ammonia that reaches the liver. Other factors that predispose rising ammonia levels include excessive protein intake, sepsis, excessive accumulation of nitrogenous body wastes (from constipation or GI hemorrhage), and bacterial action on protein and urea to form ammonia. Certain other factors heighten the brain's sensitivity to ammonia intoxication: hypoxia, azotemia, impaired glucose metabolism, infection, and administration of sedatives, narcotics, and general anesthetics. Depletion of the intravascular volume, from bleeding or diuresis, reduces hepatic and renal perfusion and leads to contraction alkalosis. In turn, hypokalemia and alkalosis increase ammonia production and impair its excretion. Complication Irreversible coma Signs and symptoms Clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy vary (depending on the severity of neurologic involvement) and develop in four stages: In the prodromal stage, early signs and symptoms are commonly overlooked because they're\\nso subtle: slight personality changes (disorientation, forgetfulness, and slurred speech) and a slight tremor. During the impending stage, tremor progresses into asterixis (liver flap and flapping tremor), the hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy. Asterixis is characterized by quick, irregular extensions and flexions of the wrists and fingers, when the wrists are held out straight and the hands flexed upward. Lethargy, aberrant behavior, and apraxia also occur. At the stuporous stage, hyperventilation occurs; the patient is typically stuporous, but becomes noisy and abusive when aroused. P In the comatose stage, the patient has hyperactive reflexes, a positive Babinski's sign, fetor hepaticus (musty, sweet odor to the breath), and coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Clinical features, a history of liver disease, and elevated serum ammonia levels in venous and arterial samples confirm hepatic encephalopathy. Other supportive laboratory values include an EEG that slows as the disease progresses, an increase in spinal fluid glutamine, elevated bilirubin, and prolonged prothrombin time. Recently, evoked potential testing has been advocated as a more specific indicator of encephalopathy, but its benefit over an EEG isn't yet clear. Treatment Effective treatment stops progression of encephalopathy by reducing blood ammonia levels. Treatment includes eliminating ammonia- producing substances from the GI tract by administering neomycin\\nto suppress bacterial flora (preventing them from converting amino acids into ammonia), performing sorbitol-induced catharsis to produce osmotic diarrhea and continuous aspiration of blood from the stomach, and reducing dietary protein intake. Lactulose, which traps ammonia in the bowel and promotes its excretion, is administered to reduce blood ammonia levels. Bacterial enzymes change lactulose to lactic acid, thereby rendering the colon too acidic for bacterial growth. At the same time, the resulting increase in free hydrogen ions prevents diffusion of ammonia through the\\nmucosa; lactulose promotes conversion of systemically absorbable ammonia to ammonium, which is poorly absorbed and can be excreted. It's usually given orally. However, if the patient is in a coma, it may be administered by retention enema. Treatment may also include potassium supplements to correct alkalosis due to increased ammonia levels, especially if the patient is taking diuretics. Hemodialysis may sometimes be used to clear\\ntoxic blood temporarily. Salt-poor albumin may be used to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, replace depleted albumin levels, and restore plasma. Sedatives, tranquilizers, and other medications metabolized or excreted by the liver should be avoided if possible. Medications containing ammonium (including certain antacids) should also\\nbe avoided. Special considerations Patient care includes monitoring symptoms and support. Assess and record the patient's level of consciousness frequently. Continually orient him to place and time. Keep\\na daily record of his handwriting to monitor the progression of neurologic involvement. Monitor the patient's intake, output, and fluid and electrolyte balance. Check daily weight and measure abdominal girth. Watch for, and immediately report, signs of anemia (decreased hemoglobin level), infection, alkalosis (increased serum bicarbonate), and GI bleeding (melena and hematemesis). If the encephalopathy is acute, ask the dietary department to provide the specified low-protein diet, with carbohydrates supplying most of the calories. Promote rest, comfort, and a quiet atmosphere. Discourage stressful exercise. Use restraints, if necessary, but avoid sedatives. Protect the comatose patient's eyes from corneal injury by using artificial tears or eye patches. Provide emotional support for the patient's family in the terminal stage of encephalopathy. GALLBLADDER AND DUCT DISORDERS Cholelithiasis and related disorders P Diseases of the gallbladder and biliary tract are common and, in many cases, painful conditions that usually require surgery and may be life- threatening. They are generally associated with deposition of calculi and inflammation. (See Common sites of calculi formation. ) Causes and incidence Cholelithiasis, stones or calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder, results from changes in bile components. Gallstones are made of cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, or\\na mixture of cholesterol and bilirubin pigment. They arise during periods of sluggishness in the gallbladder due to pregnancy, hormonal contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis is a common health problem, affecting about 1 out of every 1,000 people. The prognosis is usually good with treatment unless infection occurs, in which case the prognosis depends on its severity and response to antibiotics. COMMON SITES OF CALCULI FORMATION The illustration below shows sites where calculi typically collect. Calculi vary in size; small calculi may travel. One out of every 10 patients with gallstones develops choledocholithiasis, or gallstones in the common bile duct (sometimes called \\u201ccommon duct stones\\u201d). This occurs when stones passed out of the gallbladder lodge in\\nthe hepatic and common bile ducts and obstruct the flow of bile into the duodenum. Prognosis is good unless infection occurs. Cholangitis, infection of the\\nbile duct, is commonly associated with choledocholithiasis and may follow percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography or occlusion of endoscopic stents. Predisposing factors may include bacterial or metabolic alteration of bile acids. Widespread inflammation may cause fibrosis and stenosis of the common bile duct. The prognosis for this rare condition is poor without stenting or surgery. Cholecystitis, acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, is usually associated with a gallstone impacted in the cystic duct, causing painful distention of the\\ngallbladder. Cholecystitis accounts for 10% to 25% of all patients requiring gallbladder surgery. The acute form is most P common during middle age; the chronic form usually occurs among elderly patients. The prognosis is good with treatment. Cholesterolosis, polyps or crystal deposits of cholesterol in the gallbladder's submucosa, may result from bile secretions containing high concentrations of cholesterol and insufficient bile salts. The polyps may be localized or speckle the entire gallbladder. Cholesterolosis, the most common pseudotumor, isn't related to widespread inflammation of the mucosa or lining of the gallbladder. The prognosis is good with surgery. Biliary cirrhosis, ascending infection of the biliary system, sometimes follows viral destruction of liver and duct cells, but the primary cause is unknown. This condition usually leads to obstructive jaundice and involves the portal and periportal spaces of the liver. It's nine times more common among women ages 40 to 60 than among men. The prognosis is poor without liver transplantation. Gallstone ileus results from a gallstone lodging at the terminal ileum; it's more common in the elderly. The prognosis is good with surgery. Postcholecystectomy syndrome commonly results from residual gallstones or stricture of the common bile duct. It occurs in 1% to 5% of all patients whose gallbladders have\\nbeen surgically removed and may produce right upper quadrant abdominal pain, biliary colic, fatty food intolerance, dyspepsia, and indigestion.\\nThe prognosis is good with selected radiologic procedures, endoscopic procedures, or surgery. Acalculous cholecystitis is more common in critically ill patients, accounting for about 5% of cholecystitis cases. It may result from primary infection with such organisms as Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, or Clostridium or from obstruction of the cystic duct due to lymphadenopathy or a tumor. It appears that ischemia, usually related to a low cardiac output, also has a role in the pathophysiology of this disease. Signs and symptoms of acalculous cholecystitis include unexplained sepsis, right upper quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and a palpable gallbladder. Each of these disorders produces its own set of complications. Cholelithiasis may lead to any of the disorders associated with gallstone formation: cholangitis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and gallstone ileus. Cholecystitis can progress to gallbladder complications, such as empyema, hydrops or mucocele, or gangrene. Gangrene may lead to perforation, resulting in peritonitis, fistula formation, pancreatitis, limy bile, and porcelain gallbladder. Other complications include chronic cholecystitis and cholangitis. Choledocholithiasis may lead to cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Cholangitis, especially in the suppurative form, may progress to septic shock and death. Gallstone ileus may cause bowel obstruction, which can lead to intestinal perforation, peritonitis, septicemia, secondary infection, and septic shock. In most cases, gallbladder and bile duct diseases occur in people who are older than age 40 and are more prevalent in women and Native Americans. Complications Each of these disorders produces a set of complications. Cholelithiasis may lead to any of the disorders associated with gallstone formation: cholangitis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and gallstone ileus. Cholecystitis can progress to gallbladder complications, such as empyema, hydrops or mucocele, and gangrene. Gangrene may lead to perforation, resulting in peritonitis, fistula formation, pancreatitis, limy bile, and porcelain gallbladder. Other complications include chronic cholecystitis and cholangitis Cholecholithiasis may lead to cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Cholangitis may progress to septic shock and death, especially in the suppurative form. Gallstone ileus may cause bowel obstruction, which can lead to intestinal perforation, peritonitis, septicemia, secondary infection and septic shock. Signs and symptoms P Although gallbladder disease may produce no symptoms, acute cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and cholesterolosis produce the symptoms of a classic gallbladder attack. Attacks usually follow meals rich in fats or may occur at night, suddenly awakening the patient. They begin with acute abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant that may radiate to the back, between the shoulders, or to the front of the chest; the pain may be so severe that the patient seeks emergency department care. Other features may include recurring fat intolerance, biliary colic, belching, flatulence, indigestion, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, chills, low-grade fever, jaundice (if a stone obstructs the common bile duct), and clay- colored stools (with choledocholithiasis). Clinical features of cholangitis include a rise in eosinophils, jaundice, abdominal pain, high fever, and chills; biliary cirrhosis may produce jaundice, related itching, weakness, fatigue, slight weight loss, and abdominal pain. Gallstone ileus produces signs and symptoms of small- bowel obstruction \\u2014nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and absent bowel sounds if the bowel is completely obstructed. Its most telling symptom is intermittent recurrence of colicky pain over several days. Diagnosis Echography and X-rays detect gallstones. Other tests may include the following: Abdominal computed tomography scan or ultrasound reflects stones in the gallbladder. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography,\\ndone under fluoroscopic control, distinguishes between gallbladder or bile duct disease and cancer of the pancreatic head in patients with jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography visualizes the biliary tree after insertion of an endoscope down the esophagus into the duodenum, cannulation of the common bile and pancreatic ducts, and injection of contrast medium. HIDA scan of the gallbladder detects obstruction of the cystic duct. Oral cholecystography shows stones in the gallbladder and biliary duct obstruction. An elevated icteric index and total bilirubin, urine bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels support the diagnosis. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated during a cholecystitis attack. Differential diagnosis is essential because gallbladder disease can mimic other diseases (myocardial infarction, angina, pancreatitis, pancreatic head cancer, pneumonia, peptic ulcer, hiatal hernia, esophagitis, and gastritis). Serum amylase levels distinguish gallbladder disease from pancreatitis. With suspected heart disease, serial cardiac enzyme tests and electrocardiography should precede gallbladder and upper GI diagnostic tests. Treatment Surgery, usually elective, is the treatment of choice for\\ngallbladder and bile duct diseases and may include open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cholecystectomy with operative cholangiography, and possibly exploration of the common bile duct. Electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy can be used to fragment gallstones if they're few in number; it may be used with ursodeoxycholic acid to improve dissolution.\\nOther treatments include a low-fat diet to prevent attacks and vitamin K\\nfor itching, jaundice, and bleeding tendencies due to vitamin K deficiency. Treatment during an acute attack may include insertion of a nasogastric tube and an I.V. line and, possibly, antibiotic administration. A nonsurgical treatment for choledocholithiasis involves placement of a catheter through the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic route. Guided by fluoroscopy, the catheter is directed toward the stone. A basket is threaded through the catheter, opened, twirled to entrap the stone, closed, and withdrawn. This procedure can be performed endoscopically. Chenodeoxycholic acid, which dissolves radiolucent stones, provides an alternative for patients who are poor surgical risks\\nor who refuse surgery. Special considerations P Patient care for gallbladder and bile duct diseases focuses on supportive care and close postoperative observation. Before surgery, teach the patient to deep-breathe, cough, expectorate, and perform leg exercises that are necessary after surgery. Also teach splinting, repositioning, and ambulation techniques. Explain the procedures that will be performed before, during, and after surgery to help ease the patient's anxiety and\\nto help ensure his cooperation. After surgery, monitor the patient's vital signs for signs of bleeding, infection, or atelectasis. Evaluate the incision site for bleeding. Serosanguineous drainage is common during the first 24 to 48 hours if the patient has a wound drain. If, after a choledochostomy, a T-tube drain is placed in the duct and attached to a drainage bag, make sure that the drainage tube has no kinks. Also check that the connecting tubing from the T-tube is well secured to the patient to prevent dislodgment. Measure and record T-tube drainage daily (200 to 300 ml is normal). Teach patients who will be discharged with a T-tube how to perform dressing changes and routine skin care. Monitor the patient's intake and output. Allow him nothing by mouth for 24 to 48 hours or until bowel sounds return and nausea and vomiting cease (postoperative nausea may indicate a\\nfull bladder). If the patient doesn't void within 8 hours\\n(or if the amount voided is inadequate based on I.V. fluid intake), percuss over the symphysis pubis for bladder distention (especially in the patient receiving anticholinergics). The patient who has had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be discharged the same day or within 24\\nhours after surgery. He should have minimal pain, be able to tolerate a regular diet within 24 hours after surgery, and be able to return to normal activity within a few days to a week. Encourage deep-breathing and leg exercises\\nevery hour. The patient should ambulate after surgery. Provide elastic stockings to support the leg muscles and promote venous blood flow, thus\\npreventing stasis and clot formation. Evaluate the location, duration, and character of any pain. Administer adequate medication to relieve pain, especially before such activities as deep breathing and ambulation, which increase pain. At discharge, advise the patient against heavy lifting or straining for 6 weeks. Urge him to walk daily. Tell him\\nthat food restrictions are unnecessary unless he has an intolerance to a\\nspecific food or some underlying condition (such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, or obesity) that requires such restriction. Instruct the patient to notify the surgeon\\nif he has pain for more than 24 hours or notices any jaundice, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, fever, or tenderness in the abdominal area\\nbecause these may indicate a biliary tract injury from cholestectomy, requiring immediate attention.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction A complex system of bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and other connective tissue, the musculoskeletal system gives the body its form and shape. It also protects vital organs, makes movement possible, stores calcium and other minerals, and provides sites for hematopoiesis. A fibrous layer called the periosteum covers all bones, except at joints, where they're covered by articular cartilage. The human skeleton contains 206 bones, which are composed\\nof inorganic salts, such as calcium and phosphate, embedded in a framework of collagen fibers. Bones are classified by shape as long, short, flat, or irregular. Long bones Long bones, which are found in the limbs, include the humerus, radius, and ulna of the arm; the femur, tibia, and fibula of the leg; and the phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals in the hands and feet. These bones have a long shaft, or diaphysis, and widened, bulbous ends, called epiphyses. A long bone is made up mainly of compact bone, which surrounds the medullary cavity (also called the yellow marrow ), a storage site for fat. The lining of the medullary cavity (the endosteum ) is a thin layer of connective tissue. The outer layer is the periosteum. (See Long-bone structure. ) In children and young adults, lengthwise growth occurs at\\nthe epiphyseal cartilage between the diaphysis and epiphysis. In adults, in whom bone growth is complete, this cartilage is ossified and forms the epiphyseal line. The epiphysis also has a surface layer made up of compact bone, but its center is made of spongy or cancellous bone.\\nCancellous bone contains open spaces between thin threads of bone, called trabeculae, which are arranged in various directions to correspond with the lines of maximum stress or pressure. This configuration gives the bone added structural strength. Unlike cancellous bone, adult compact bone consists of numerous orderly networks of interconnecting canals that run parallel to\\nthe bone's long axis. Each of these networks, called a haversian system, consists of a central haversian canal surrounded by layers (lamellae) of bone. Between adjacent lamellae are small openings (lacunae), which contain bone cells (osteocytes). All lacunae are joined by an interconnecting network of tiny canals (canaliculi), each of which contains one or more capillaries and provides a route for\\nmovement of tissue fluids. The haversian system carries blood to the bone through blood vessels that enter the system through channels called Volkmann's canals. Short, flat, or irregular bones Short bones include the tarsal and carpal bones; flat bones, the frontal and parietal bones of the cranium, ribs, sternum, scapulae, ilium, and pubis; and irregular bones, the bones of the spine (vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx) and certain bones of the skull (sphenoid, ethmoid, and mandible). Short, flat, and irregular bones have an outer layer of compact bone and an inner portion of spongy bone. In the sternum and certain areas in the flat bones of the skull, the spongy bone contains red marrow. Joints The tissues connecting two bones make up a joint, which permits motion between the bones and provides stability. Joints, like bones, have varying forms. Fibrous joints (synarthroses) have only minute motion and provide stability when tight union is necessary, as in the seams, called sutures, that join the cranial bones. P Cartilaginous joints (amphiarthroses) have limited motion, as between vertebrae and symphysis pubis. Synovial joints (diarthroses) are the most common and have the greatest degree of movement. Such joints include the elbows, shoulder, and knees. Synovial joints have special characteristics: the articulating surfaces of each bone have a smooth hyaline covering (articular cartilage), which is resilient to pressure; their opposing surfaces are congruous and glide smoothly on each other without touching each other; a fibrous (articular) capsule holds them together. Beneath the capsule and lining the joint cavity, the synovial membrane secretes the clear, viscous synovial\\nfluid. This fluid lubricates the two opposing surfaces during motion and also nourishes the articular cartilage. Surrounding a synovial joint\\nare ligaments, muscles, and tendons, which strengthen and stabilize the\\njoint but allow free movement. LONG-BONE STRUCTURE Long-bone composition is depicted below, with an illustrated cross section. In some synovial joints, the synovial membrane forms two additional structures \\u2014 bursae and tendon sheaths \\u2014 which reduce friction that normally accompanies movement. Bursae are small, cushionlike sacs lined with synovial membranes and filled with synovial fluid; most are located between tendons and bones. Tendon sheaths wrap around the tendon and cushion it as it crosses the joint. The synovial joints permit angular and circular movements. Angular movements include flexion (decrease in joint angle), extension (increase in the joint angle), and hyperextension (increase in the angle of extension beyond the usual arc). Joints of the knees, elbows, and P phalanges permit such movement. Other angular movements are abduction (movement away from the body's midline) and adduction (movement toward the body's midline). Circular movements include rotation (motion around a central axis), as in the ball-and-socket joints of the hips and shoulders; pronation (wrist motion to place palmar surface of the hand down, with the thumb toward the body); supination (begging position, with palm up). Other kinds of movement are inversion (movement facing inward), eversion (movement facing outward), protraction (as in forward motion of the mandible), and retraction (returning protracted part into place). Muscles Muscle tissues' most specialized feature \\u2014 contractility \\u2014 makes movement of bones and joints possible. Muscles also pump blood through the body, move food through the intestines, and make breathing possible. Muscular activity produces heat, so it's an important component in temperature regulation. Muscles maintain body positions, such as sitting and standing. Muscle mass accounts for about 40% of the body weight of a person of average size. Muscles are classified in many ways. Skeletal muscles are attached to bone, visceral muscles permit function of internal organs, and cardiac muscles make up the heart wall. Also, muscles may be striated or nonstriated (smooth), depending on their cellular configuration. Muscles classified according to activity are called voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary muscles can be controlled at will and are under the influence\\nof the somatic nervous system; these are the skeletal muscles. Involuntary muscles, controlled by the autonomic nervous system, include\\nthe cardiac and visceral muscles. Each skeletal muscle consists of many elongated muscle cells, called muscle fibers, through which run slender threads of protein, called myofibrils. Muscle fibers are held together in bundles by sheaths of fibrous tissue, called fascia. Blood vessels and nerves pass through the fascia to reach the individual muscle fibers. Skeletal muscles are attached to bone directly or indirectly by fibrous cords called tendons. The least movable end of the muscle attachment is called the point of origin; the most movable end is the point of insertion. Mechanism of contraction To stimulate muscle contraction and movement, the brain sends motor impulses through the peripheral motor nerves to motor nerve fibers in the voluntary muscle. These nerve fibers reach membranes of skeletal muscle cells at neuromuscular ( myoneural )\\njunctions. When an impulse reaches the myoneural junction, it triggers the following sequence: release of the neurochemical acetylcholine, transient release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a membranous network in the muscle fiber), and muscle contraction. The arriving impulse at the myoneural junction also triggers release of adenosine triphosphate, the energy source for muscle contraction. Muscle\\nrelaxation is believed to take place by reversal of the above mechanisms. Musculoskeletal assessment Most patients with musculoskeletal disorders are elderly,\\nhave concurrent medical conditions, or have experienced trauma. Younger patients tend to experience more benign, self-limited conditions. Generally, they face prolonged immobilization. These factors make thorough assessment essential. Your assessment should include a complete\\nhistory and a careful physical examination in order to determine a possible cause of the symptoms. Interview the patient carefully to obtain a complete medical, social, and personal history. Ask about general activity (does he jog daily, or is he sedentary?), which may be significantly altered by musculoskeletal disease or trauma. Does the patient have any systemic\\nsymptoms, such as fever, chills, weight loss, or skin rashes? Obtain information about occupation, diet, sexual activity, and elimination habits, drugs taken, use of safety devices, and try to assess how the problem will affect body image. Also, ask how he functions at home. Can he perform activities of daily living? Does he have difficulty getting around? Are there stairs where he lives? Where are the bathroom and bedroom? Does he use any prosthetic devices? Ask if other family members\\ncan help with his care. P Get an accurate account of the musculoskeletal problem. Ask the patient if it has caused him to change his everyday routine. When did symptoms begin and how did they progress? Has the patient received treatment for this problem? If he's experienced trauma, find out how he was hurt. Assess the level of pain. Is the patient in pain at the moment? Ask what makes the discomfort worse or better (movement, position, and so forth). Evaluate past and present responses to treatment. For instance, if the patient has arthritis and uses corticosteroids, ask him about their effectiveness. Does he require more\\nor less medication than before? Did he comply with the prescribed treatment? The physical examination helps to determine the diagnosis\\nand reveals any existing disabilities. (These baseline data will help when the effects of treatment are evaluated.) Observe the patient's appearance. Look for localized edema, pigmentation, redness and tenderness at pressure points, and other deformities such as atrophy. Note mobility, strength, and gait. To check range of motion, ask the patient to abduct, adduct, or flex the muscles in question. Obtain height, weight, and vital signs. Check neurovascular status, including motion sensation and circulation. Measure and record discrepancies in muscle circumference or leg length. Compare one side or limb to the other. If a neck injury is suspected, don't force range of motion. Diagnostic tools X-rays are a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate musculoskeletal diseases. They can help to identify joint disruption, bone deformities, calcifications, and bone destruction and fractures. X-rays also measure bone density. Myelography is an invasive procedure used to evaluate abnormalities of the spinal canal and cord. It entails injection of a radiopaque contrast medium into the subarachnoid space of\\nthe spine. Serial X- rays visualize the progress of the contrast medium as it passes through the subarachnoid space. Displacement of the medium indicates a space-occupying lesion, such as a herniated disk or a tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in evaluating soft tissue injuries or ligament tears, such as rotator cuff tears or meniscal tears. Computed tomography scan can be used to identify injuries to bones, soft tissue, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Arthroscopy is the visual examination of the interior of a joint with a fiber-optic endoscope. Other useful tests include bone and muscle biopsies, electromyography, microscopic examination of synovial fluid, and multiple laboratory studies of urine and blood to identify systemic abnormalities. Patient care Each patient with musculoskeletal disease needs an individual care plan formulated early in his hospital stay by the entire\\nclinical team, including the physician, physical therapist, and occupational therapist. Develop this plan with short- and long-term goals, during and after hospitalization. Caring for the patient with a musculoskeletal disease usually includes at least one of the following: traction, casts, braces,\\nsplints, crutches, intermittent range-of-motion devices, prolonged immobilization, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and self-care measures; adequate vitamin D intake, weight loss, dietary modifications,\\nand drugs. Traction is the manual or mechanical application of a steady pulling force to reduce a fracture, minimize muscle spasms, or immobilize or align a joint. Skin traction is the indirect application of traction to the skeletal system through skin and soft tissues. Skeletal traction is the direct application of traction to bones by means of a pin (Steinmann pin) or wire (Kirschner wire) through the affected bone or by calipers or a tonglike device (Gardner-Wells tongs) that grips the bone. Manual traction, for emergency use, is the direct application of traction to a body part by hand. P During the use of all types of traction: Explain to the patient how traction works,\\nand advise him about permissible amounts of activity and elevation of the head of the bed. Inform him of the anticipated duration of traction and whether or not the traction is removable. Teach active range-of-motion exercises. Check neurovascular status to prevent nerve damage. Also, make sure the mattress is firm, that the traction ropes aren't frayed, that they're on the center track of the pulley, and\\nthat traction weights are hanging free. Thoroughly investigate any complaint the patient makes. Check for signs of infection (odor, local inflammation and drainage, or fever) at pin sites if the patient is in skeletal traction. Also, check with the physician's or the facility's procedure regarding pin-site care, such as use of peroxide or povidone-iodine. Ideally, a cast immobilizes without adding too much weight. It's snug- fitting but doesn't constrict and has a smooth inner surface and smooth edges to prevent pressure or skin irritation. Casts require comprehensive patient education. A plaster cast takes 24 to 48 hours to dry. To prevent indentations, tell the patient not to squeeze the cast with his fingers, not to cover or walk on the cast until it has dried, and not to bump a damp cast on hard surfaces because dents can cause pressure areas. Warn the patient that while the cast is drying, he'll feel a temporary sensation of heat under the cast. If fiberglass is used, the cast may feel dry and the patient may be able to bear weight immediately. Advise the patient, however, not to get the cast wet. Although the fiberglass won't\\ndisintegrate as plaster would, the padding will become wet and potentially cause maceration of the skin. Emphasize the need to keep the cast above heart level for 24 hours after its application to reduce swelling in the limb. While the cast is drying and after drying is complete, the patient should watch for and immediately report persistent pain in the limb inside or distal to the cast as well as edema, changes in skin color, coldness, or tingling or numbness in this area. If any of these signs occur, tell the patient to position the casted body part above heart level and notify his physician. The patient should also report drainage through the cast or an odor that may indicate infection. Warn against inserting foreign objects under the cast, getting it wet, pulling out its padding, or scratching inside it. Tell the patient to seek immediate\\nattention for a broken cast. Instruct the patient to exercise the joints above and below the cast to prevent stiffness and contracture. Braces, splints, and slings also provide alignment, immobilization, and pain relief for musculoskeletal diseases. Slings and\\nsplints are usually used for short-term immobilization. Explain to the patient and his family why these appliances are necessary, and show them\\nthe proper way to apply the sling, splint, or brace for optimal benefit. Tell the patient how long the appliance will have to be worn, and advise him of any activity limitations that must be observed. If the\\npatient has a brace, check with his orthotist (orthopedic appliance specialist) about proper care. Encourage the patient to refer additional\\nquestions to his physician. Teach proper crutch walking. Coping with immobility Immobilized patients require meticulous care to prevent complications. Without constant care, the bedridden patient becomes susceptible to pressure ulcers, caused by the increased pressure on tissue over bony prominences, and is especially vulnerable to cardiopulmonary complications. To prevent pressure ulcers, turn the patient regularly and, if possible, position him in a 30-degree side-lying position for short periods. In addition, place a flotation pad or sheepskin pad under bony prominences, or use an alternating-air-current, convoluted foam, or foam mattress. Show the patient how to use a Balkan frame with a trapeze to move about in bed. Keep the patient's skin dry and clean. Keep the sheets wrinkle-free. P Increase fluid intake to minimize risk of renal calculi. Provide adequate nutrition; a high-protein diet is preferred, if tolerated. Perform passive range-of-motion (ROM) exercises on the affected side, as ordered, to prevent contractures, and\\ninstruct the patient in active ROM exercises on the unaffected side. Apply footboards or high- topped sneakers to prevent footdrop. Keep the patient's heels off the bed to prevent heel breakdown. Also, watch for reddened elbows. Because most bedridden patients involuntarily perform a Valsalva maneuver when using the upper arms and trunk to move, instruct the patient to exhale (instead of holding his breath) as he turns. This will prevent possible cardiac complications that result from increased intrathoracic pressure. Emphasize the importance of coughing and deep breathing, and teach the patient how to use the incentive spirometer if ordered. Because constipation is a common problem in bedridden patients, establish a bowel program (fluids, fiber, laxatives, stool softeners), as needed. Rehabilitation Restoring the patient to his former state of health isn't\\nalways possible. When it isn't, help the patient adjust to a modified lifestyle. During hospitalization, promote independence by letting him finish difficult tasks by himself. If necessary, refer the patient to a community facility for continued rehabilitation. CONGENITAL DISORDERS Clubfoot Clubfoot, or talipes, is the most common congenital disorder of the lower limbs. It's marked primarily by a deformed talus and shortened Achilles tendon, which give the foot a characteristic clublike appearance. In talipes equinovarus, the foot points downward (equinus) and turns inward (varus), whereas the\\nfront of the foot curls toward the heel (forefoot adduction). Causes and incidence A combination of genetic and environmental factors in utero appears to cause clubfoot. Heredity is a definite factor in some cases, although the mechanism of transmission is undetermined. In children without a family history of clubfoot, this anomaly seems linked\\nto arrested development during the 9th and 10th weeks of embryonic life, when the feet are formed. Researchers also suspect muscle abnormalities, leading to variations in length and tendon insertions, as\\npossible causes of clubfoot. Clubfoot, which has an incidence of about 1 per 1,000 live births, usually occurs bilaterally and is twice as common in boys. It may be associated with other birth defects, such as myelomeningocele,\\nspina bifida, and arthrogryposis. However, most cases are sporadic occurrences. Complication Retention deformity Signs and symptoms Talipes equinovarus varies greatly in severity. Deformity\\nmay be so extreme that the toes touch the inside of the ankle, or it may be only vaguely apparent. In every case, the talus is deformed, the Achilles tendon shortened, and the calcaneus somewhat shortened and flattened. Depending on the degree of the varus deformity, the calf muscles are shortened and underdeveloped, and soft-tissue contractures form at the site of the deformity. The foot is tight in its deformed position and resists manual efforts to push it into normal position. Clubfoot is painless, except in elderly, arthritic patients. In older children, clubfoot may be secondary to paralysis, poliomyelitis, or cerebral palsy, in which case treatment must include management of the underlying disease. P Diagnosis Early diagnosis of clubfoot is usually possible because the deformity is obvious. In subtle deformity, however, true clubfoot must be distinguished from apparent clubfoot (metatarsus varus or pigeon\\ntoe). Apparent clubfoot results when a fetus maintains a position in utero that gives his feet a clubfoot appearance at birth. This can usually be corrected manually. Another form of apparent clubfoot is inversion of the feet, resulting from the peroneal type of progressive muscular atrophy and progressive muscular dystrophy. In true clubfoot, X-rays show superimposition of the talus and the calcaneus and a ladderlike appearance of the metatarsals. (See Recognizing clubfoot. ) RECOGNIZING CLUBFOOT Clubfoot ( talipes ) may have various names, depending on the orientation of the deformity, as shown in the illustrations at right. Treatment Clubfoot is correctable with prompt treatment, which is performed in three stages: correcting the deformity, maintaining the correction until the foot regains normal muscle balance, and observing the foot closely for several years to prevent the deformity from recurring. In neonates with true clubfoot, corrective treatment should begin at once. An infant's foot contains large amounts of cartilage; the\\nmuscles, ligaments, and tendons are supple. The ideal time to begin treatment is during the first few days and weeks of life, when the foot is most malleable. Clubfoot deformities are usually corrected in sequential order. Several therapeutic methods have been found effective in correcting clubfoot. In all patients, the first procedure should be simple manipulation and P casting, whereby the foot is gently manipulated into a partially corrected position and held in place by a cast for several days or weeks. (The skin should be painted with a nonirritating adhesive liquid beforehand to prevent the cast from slipping.) After the\\ncast is removed, the foot is manipulated into an even better position and casted again. This procedure is repeated as many times as necessary.\\nIn some cases, the shape of the cast can be transformed through a series of wedging maneuvers instead of changing the cast each time. After correction of clubfoot, proper foot alignment should be maintained through exercise, night splints, and orthopedic shoes. With manipulating and casting, correction usually takes about 3 months. The Denis Browne splint, a device that consists of two padded, metal footplates connected by a flat, horizontal bar, is sometimes used as a follow-up measure to help promote bilateral correction and strengthen the foot muscles. Resistant clubfoot may require surgery. Older children, for example, with recurrent or neglected clubfoot usually need surgery. Tenotomy, tendon transfer, stripping of the plantar fascia, and capsulotomy are some of the surgical procedures that may be used. In severe cases, bone surgery (wedge resections, osteotomy, or astragalectomy) may be appropriate. After surgery, a cast is applied to preserve the correction. Clubfoot severe enough to require surgery is rarely totally correctable; however, surgery can usually ameliorate the deformity. Special considerations The primary concern is recognition of clubfoot as early as possible, preferably in neonates. Look for any exaggerated attitudes in an infant's feet. Make sure you recognize the difference between true clubfoot and apparent clubfoot. Don't use excessive force in trying to manipulate a clubfoot. The foot with apparent clubfoot moves easily. Stress to parents the importance of prompt\\ntreatment. Make sure they understand that clubfoot demands immediate therapy and orthopedic supervision until growth is completed. After casting, elevate the child's feet with pillows. Check the toes every 1 to 2 hours for temperature, color, sensation, motion, and capillary refill time; watch for edema. Before a child in a clubfoot cast is discharged, teach parents to recognize circulatory impairment. Insert plastic petals over the top edges of a new cast while it's still wet to keep urine from soaking and softening the cast. This is done as follows: Cut a plastic sheet into strips long enough to cover the outside of the cast, and tuck them about\\na finger length beneath the cast edges. Using overlapping strips of tape, tack the corner of each petal to the outside of the cast. When the\\ncast is dry, petal the edges with adhesive tape to keep out plaster crumbs and prevent skin irritation. Perform good skin care under the cast edges every 4 hours, washing and carefully drying the skin. (Don't rub the skin with alcohol, and don't use oils or powders, which tend to macerate the skin.) If the child is old enough to walk, caution parents not to let the foot part of the cast get soft and thin from wear. If it does, much of the correction may be lost. When the wedging method of shaping the cast is being used, check circulatory status frequently; it may be impaired by increased pressure on tissues and blood vessels. The equinus\\n(posterior release) correction especially places considerable strain on\\nligaments, blood vessels, and tendons. After surgery, elevate the child's feet with pillows to decrease swelling and pain. Report signs of discomfort or pain right away. Try to locate the source of pain; it may result from\\ncast pressure rather than from the incision. If bleeding occurs under the cast, circle the location and mark the time on the cast. If bleeding\\nspreads, report it. Explain to the older child and his parents\\nthat surgery can improve clubfoot with good function but can't totally correct it; the affected calf muscle will remain slightly underdeveloped. Emphasize the need for long-term orthopedic care to maintain correction. Teach parents the prescribed exercises that the child can do at home. Urge them to make the child wear the corrective shoes ordered and the splints during naps and at night. Make sure they understand that treatment for clubfoot continues during the entire P growth period. Correcting this defect permanently takes time and patience. Developmental dysplasia of the hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), an abnormality of the hip joint present from birth, is the most common disorder affecting hip joints of children younger than age 3. DDH can be unilateral or bilateral. This abnormality occurs in three forms of varying severity: unstable hip dysplasia, in which the hip is positioned normally but can be dislocated by manipulation; subluxation or incomplete dislocation, in which the femoral head rides on the edge of the acetabulum; and complete or true congenital dislocation, in which the femoral head is totally outside the acetabulum. (See Degrees of hip dysplasia. ) DEGREES OF HIP DYSPLASIA Normally, the head of the femur fits snugly into the acetabulum, allowing the hip to move properly. In developmental dysplasia of the hip, flattening of the acetabulum prevents the head of the femur from rotating adequately. The child's hip may be unstable, subluxated (partially dislocated), or completely dislocated, with the femoral head lying totally outside the acetabulum. The degree of dysplasia and the child's age are considered in determining the treatment choice. Developmental hip subluxation or dislocation can cause abnormal acetabular development and permanent disability. Causes and incidence Experts are uncertain about the causes of DDH. Dislocation is 10 times more common after breech delivery (malpositioning in utero) than after cephalic delivery, and it's also more common among large neonates and P twins. It's a lot more common in firstborn children. Girls are affected more often than boys and white children more than black children. Genetic factors may also play a role. Although DDH is found throughout the world, incidence is particularly high among Native Americans. Complications Degenerative hip changes (if treatment is delayed) Lordosis Joint malformation Crippling osteoarthritis Signs and symptoms Clinical effects of hip dysplasia vary with age. In neonates, dysplasia doesn't cause gross deformity or pain. However, in complete dysplasia, the hip rides above the acetabulum, causing the level of the knees to be uneven. As the child grows older and begins to walk, the abduction on the dislocated side is limited. Uncorrected bilateral dysplasia may cause him to sway from side to side, a condition\\nknown as \\u201cduck waddle\\u201d; unilateral dysplasia may produce a limp. If corrective treatment isn't begun until after age 2, DDH may cause degenerative hip changes, lordosis, joint malformation, and soft-tissue damage. Diagnosis Several observations during physical examination of the relaxed child strongly suggest DDH. First, place the child on his back, and inspect the folds of skin over his thighs. Usually, a child in this position has an equal number of thigh folds on each side, but a child with subluxation or dislocation may have an extra fold on the affected side (this extra fold is also apparent when the child lies prone). Next,\\nwith the child lying prone, check for alignment of the buttock fold. In\\na child with dysplasia, the buttock fold on the affected side is higher. In addition, abduction of the affected hip is restricted. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A positive Ortolani's or Trendelenburg's sign confirms DDH. To elicit Ortolani's sign, place the infant on his back, with his hip flexed and abducted. Adducting the hip while pressing the femur downward will dislocate the hip. Then, abducting the hip while moving the femur upward will move the femoral head over the acetabular rim. If you hear a click or feel a jerk as the femoral head moves, the test is positive. This sign indicates subluxation in a neonate younger than 1 month and subluxation or complete dislocation in an older infant. To elicit Trendelenburg's sign, have the child rest his weight on the side of the dislocation and lift his other knee. His pelvis drops on the normal side because of weak abductor muscles in the affected hip. However, when the child stands with his weight on the normal side and lifts the other knee, the pelvis remains horizontal. Ultrasound of the hip reveals hip deformity. X-rays show the location of the femur head and a shallow acetabulum. X-rays may also\\nshow acetabular dysplasia or a teratological dislocation. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be used to assess reduction. Treatment The earlier the infant receives treatment, the better his\\nchances are for normal development. Treatment varies with the patient's\\nage and is tailored to the specific pathological condition. In infants younger than 6 months, treatment includes gentle manipulation to reduce the dislocation, followed by holding the hips in\\na flexed and abducted position with a splint-brace or harness to maintain the reduction. The infant must wear this apparatus continuously\\nfor 2 to 3 months and then use a night splint for another month so the joint capsule can tighten and stabilize in correct alignment. If treatment doesn't begin until after age 3 months, it may include bilateral skin traction (in infants) or skeletal traction (in children who have started walking) in an attempt to reduce the dislocation by gradually abducting the hips. In Bryant's traction, or divarication P traction, both legs are placed in traction, even if only one is affected, to help maintain immobilization. This type of traction is used in children who are younger than 3 years and weigh less than 35 lb (16 kg). The length of treatment is 2 to 3 weeks. If traction fails, gentle closed reduction under general anesthetic can further abduct the hips; the child is then placed in a spica cast for 4 to 6 months. If closed treatment fails, open reduction,\\nfollowed by immobilization in a spica cast for an average of 6 months, or osteotomy may be considered. In the child age 2 to 5 years, treatment is difficult and\\nincludes skeletal traction and subcutaneous adductor tenotomy. Treatment begun after age 5 rarely restores satisfactory hip function. Special considerations The child who must wear a splint, brace, or body cast needs special personal care that requires parent education. Teach parents how to correctly splint or brace the hips, as ordered. Stress the need for frequent checkups. Listen sympathetically to the parents' expressions of anxiety and fear. Explain possible causes of developmental hip dislocation, and give reassurance that early, prompt treatment will probably result in complete correction. During the child's first few days in a cast or splint-brace, he may be prone to irritability due to the unaccustomed restricted movement. Encourage his parents to stay with him\\nas much as possible and to calm and reassure him. Assure parents that the child will adjust to this restriction and return to normal sleeping, eating, and playing behavior in a few days. Instruct parents to remove braces and splints while bathing the infant but to replace them immediately afterward. Stress good hygiene; parents should bathe and change the child frequently and wash his perineum with warm water and soap at each diaper change. If treatment requires a spica cast: When transferring the child immediately after casting, use your palms to avoid making dents in the cast. Such dents predispose the patient to pressure sores. Remember that the cast needs 24 to 48 hours to dry naturally. Don't use heat to make it dry faster because heat also makes it more fragile. Immediately after the cast is applied, use\\na plastic sheet to protect it from moisture around the perineum and buttocks. Cut the sheet into strips long enough to cover the outside of the cast, and tuck them about a finger length beneath the cast edges. Using overlapping strips of tape, tack the corner of each petal to the outside of the cast. Remove the plastic under the cast every 4 hours; then wash, dry, and retuck it. Disposable diapers folded lengthwise over\\nthe perineum may also be used. Position the child either on a Bradford frame elevated on blocks, with a bedpan under the frame, or on pillows to support the child's legs. Be sure to keep the cast dry, and change the child's diapers often. Turn the child every 2 hours during the day and every 4 hours at night. Check color, sensation, and motion of the infant's legs and feet. Be sure to examine all his toes. Notify the physician of dusky, cool, or numb toes. Check the cast daily for odors, which may herald infection. If the child complains of itching, he may benefit from diphenhydramine, or you may aim a hair dryer set on cool at\\nthe cast edges to relieve itching. Don't scratch or probe under the cast. Investigate any persistent itching. Provide adequate nutrition, and maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid renal calculi and constipation, both complications of inactivity. Provide adequate stimuli to promote growth and development. Tell parents to watch for signs that the child is outgrowing the cast (cyanosis, cool limbs, or pain). Tell parents that treatment may be prolonged and requires patience. The patient in Bryant's traction may be cared for at home if the parents are taught traction application and maintenance. P Encourage the parents to cuddle and hold the child and encourage him to interact with siblings and friends. Maintain skin integrity and check circulation at least every 2 hours. Feed the child carefully to avoid aspiration and choking. Refer the child and his parents to a child life specialist to ensure continued developmental progress. Muscular dystrophy Muscular dystrophy is actually a group of congenital disorders characterized by progressive symmetrical wasting of skeletal muscles without neural or sensory defects. Paradoxically, these wasted muscles tend to enlarge because of connective tissue and fat deposits, giving an erroneous impression of muscle strength. The main types of muscular dystrophy are Duchenne's (pseudohypertrophic), Becker's (benign pseudohypertrophic), facioscapulohumeral (Landouzy-Dejerine), limb- girdle dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, and myotonia congenita. The prognosis varies. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy generally strikes during early childhood and usually results in death by\\nage 20. Patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy typically live into their 40s. Facioscapulohumeral and limb-girdle dystrophies usually don't\\nshorten life. Causes and incidence Muscular dystrophy is caused by various genetic mechanisms. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive disorders. Both result from defects in the gene coding for the\\nmuscle protein dystrophin; the gene has been mapped to the Xp21 locus. The incidence muscular dystrophy is about 1 in 651,450 persons in the United States. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies affect males almost exclusively. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder. Limb- girdle dystrophy is usually autosomal recessive. These two types affect both sexes about equally. Complications Inhibited pulmonary function due to deformities Greater risk for pneumonia Respiratory problems lead to arrhythmias and hypertrophy Signs and symptoms Although all four types of muscular dystrophy cause progressive muscular deterioration, the degree of severity and age of onset vary. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy begins insidiously, between\\nages 3 and 5. Initially, it affects leg and pelvic muscles but eventually spreads to the involuntary muscles. Muscle weakness produces a\\nwaddling gait, toe walking, and lordosis. Children with this disorder have difficulty climbing stairs, fall down often, can't run properly, and their scapulae flare out (or \\u201cwing\\u201d) when they raise their arms. Calf muscles especially become enlarged and firm. Muscle deterioration progresses rapidly, and contractures develop. Some have abrupt intermittent oscillations of the irises in response to light (Gower's sign). Usually, these children are confined to wheelchairs by ages 9 to 12. Late in the disease, progressive weakening of cardiac muscle causes tachycardia, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and pulmonary complications. Death commonly results from sudden heart failure, respiratory failure, or infection. Signs and symptoms of Becker's muscular dystrophy resemble those of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, but they progress more slowly. Although symptoms start around age 5, the patient can still walk\\nwell beyond age 15 \\u2014 sometimes into his 40s. Cardiac involvement is much less frequent. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is a slowly progressive and\\nrelatively benign form of muscular dystrophy that commonly occurs before age 10 but may develop during early adolescence. The earlier the disease occurs, the more rapid and progressive it is. Initially, it weakens the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms but eventually spreads to all voluntary muscles, producing a pendulous lower\\nlip and absence of the nasolabial fold. Early symptoms include the inability to pucker the mouth or whistle, abnormal facial movements, and\\nthe absence of facial P movements when laughing or crying. Other signs consist of diffuse facial flattening that leads to a masklike expression, winging of the scapulae, the inability to raise the arms above the head and, in infants, the inability to suckle. Limb-girdle dystrophy follows a similarly slow course and\\ncommonly causes only slight disability. Usually, it begins between ages\\n6 and 10; less commonly, in early adulthood. The later the onset, the more rapid the progression. Muscle weakness first appears in the upper arm and pelvic muscles. Other symptoms include winging of the scapulae, lordosis with abdominal protrusion, waddling gait, poor balance, and the inability to raise the arms. Diagnosis Diagnosis depends on typical clinical findings, family history, and diagnostic test findings. If another family member has muscular dystrophy, its clinical characteristics can indicate the type of dystrophy the patient has and how he may be affected. Electromyography typically demonstrates short, weak bursts of electrical activity or high-frequency, repetitive waxing and waning discharges in affected muscles. Muscle biopsy shows variations in\\nthe size of muscle fibers and, in later stages, shows fat and connective tissue deposits; dystrophin is absent in Duchenne's dystrophy\\nand diminished in Becker's dystrophy. Serum creatine kinase level is markedly elevated in Duchenne's, but only moderately elevated in Becker's and facioscapulohumeral dystrophies. Immunologic and molecular biological assays available in specialized medical centers facilitate accurate prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies and are replacing muscle biopsy and elevated serum creatine kinase levels in diagnosing these dystrophies. These assays can also help to identify carriers. Treatment No treatment stops the progressive muscle impairment of muscular dystrophy. However, orthopedic appliances, exercise, physical therapy, and surgery to correct contractures can help preserve the patient's mobility and independence. Prednisone improves muscle strength\\nin patients with Duchenne's. Special considerations Comprehensive long-term care and follow-up, patient and family teaching, and psychological support can help the patient and his family deal with this disorder. When respiratory involvement occurs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, encourage coughing, deep-breathing exercises, and diaphragmatic breathing. Teach parents how to recognize early signs of respiratory complications. Encourage and assist with active and passive range-of-motion exercises to preserve joint mobility and prevent muscle atrophy. Advise the patient to avoid long periods of bed rest and inactivity; if necessary, limit TV viewing and other sedentary activities. Refer the patient for physical therapy. Splints, braces, surgery to correct contractures, trapeze bars, overhead\\nslings, and a wheelchair can help preserve mobility. A footboard or high-topped sneakers and a foot cradle increase comfort and prevent footdrop. Because inactivity may cause constipation,\\nencourage adequate fluid intake, increase dietary bulk, and obtain an order for a stool softener. The patient is prone to obesity due to reduced physical activity; help him and his family plan a low-calorie, high-protein, high-fiber diet. Always allow the patient plenty of time to perform even simple physical tasks because he's likely to be slow and awkward. Encourage communication between the patient's family members to help them deal with the emotional strain this disorder produces. Provide emotional support to help the patient cope with continual changes in body image. PEDIATRIC TIP Help the child with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy to maintain peer relationships and to realize his intellectual P potential by encouraging his parents to keep him in a regular school as long as possible. If necessary, refer adult patients for counseling. Refer those who must acquire new job skills for vocational rehabilitation. (Contact the Department of Labor and Industry in your state for more information.) For information on social services and financial assistance, refer these patients and their families to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Refer the patient's family members for genetic counseling. JOINTS Septic arthritis Septic, or infectious, arthritis is a medical emergency that occurs when bacterial invasion of a joint causes inflammation of the synovial lining, effusion and pyogenesis, and destruction of bone and cartilage. Septic arthritis can lead to ankylosis and even fatal septicemia. However, prompt antibiotic therapy and joint aspiration or drainage cures most patients. Causes and incidence In most cases of septic arthritis, bacteria spread from a\\nprimary site of infection \\u2014 usually in adjacent bone or soft tissue \\u2014 through the bloodstream to the joint. Common infecting organisms in children are group B Streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. Adults are usually infected by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (pneumonia), and group B Streptococcus, whereas chronic septic arthritis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. Various factors can predispose a person to septic arthritis. Any concurrent bacterial infection (of the genitourinary or the upper respiratory tract, for example) or serious chronic illness (such as malignancy, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, or cirrhosis) heightens susceptibility. Consequently, elderly people and those who abuse I.V. drugs run a higher risk of developing septic arthritis. Of course, diseases that depress the immune system and immunosuppressive therapy increase susceptibility. Other predisposing factors include recent articular trauma, joint arthroscopy or other surgery, intra-articular injections, local joint abnormalities, animal or human bites, and nail puncture wounds. Septic arthritis may be seen at any age in children, but it occurs most often in children younger than age 3. It's uncommon from age 3 until adolescence, at which time the incidence increases again. Complications Joint degeneration Osteomyelitis Signs and symptoms Acute septic arthritis begins abruptly, causing intense pain, inflammation, and swelling of the affected joint and low-grade fever. It usually affects a single joint. It most commonly develops in the large joints but can strike any joint, including the spine and small\\nperipheral joints. The hip is a frequent site in infants. Systemic signs of inflammation may not appear in some patients. Migratory polyarthritis sometimes precedes localization of the infection. If the bacteria invade the hip, pain may occur in the groin, upper thigh, or buttock or may be referred to the knee. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Identifying the causative organism in a Gram stain or culture of synovial fluid or a biopsy of synovial membrane confirms septic arthritis. When synovial fluid culture is negative, positive blood culture may confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound of the hip is the modality of choice to detect fluid collections in the hip joint and can serve as a guide during aspiration procedures. P Joint fluid analysis shows gross pus or watery, cloudy fluid of decreased viscosity, usually with 50,000/mcl or more white cells, primarily neutrophils. Synovial fluid glucose is usually more than 40 mg/dl. (See Other types of arthritis, page 336.) Other diagnostic measures include the following: X-rays can show typical changes as early as 1 week after initial infection \\u2014 distention of joint capsules, for example, followed by narrowing of joint space (indicating cartilage damage) and erosions of bone (joint destruction). White blood cell count may be elevated, with many polymorphonuclear cells; erythrocyte sedimentation rate is increased. Triple-phase bone scan is often used in children. A whole body scan is preferred in very young children. CT and MRI can provide useful images to delineate the extent of the infection. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should begin as soon as a Gram stain has been done; it may be modified when drug sensitivity of the infecting\\norganism is known. Bioassays or bactericidal assays of synovial fluid and bioassays of blood may confirm clearing of the infection. Rest, immobilization, elevation, and warm compresses help\\nwith pain relief. Analgesics are given for pain, if needed. The affected joint can be immobilized with a splint or put into traction until the patient can tolerate movement. In severe cases, needle aspiration (arthrocentesis) or surgery may be done under sterile conditions to remove grossly purulent or infected joint fluid. Late reconstructive surgery is warranted only for severe joint damage and only after all signs of active infection have disappeared, which usually takes several months. Recommended procedures include arthroplasty and joint fusion. Prosthetic replacement\\nremains controversial because it may exacerbate the infection, but it has helped patients with damaged femoral heads or acetabula. OTHER TYPES OF ARTHRITIS Hemophilic arthrosis Hemophilic arthrosis produces transient or permanent joint changes. Often precipitated by trauma, hemophilic arthrosis usually arises between ages 1 and 5 and tends to recur until about age 10. It usually affects only one joint at a time \\u2014 most commonly the knee, elbow, or ankle \\u2014 and tends to recur in the same joint. Initially, the patient may feel only mild discomfort; later, he may experience warmth, swelling, tenderness, and severe pain with adjacent muscle spasm\\nthat leads to flexion of the extremity. Mild hemophilic arthrosis may cause only limited stiffness that subsides within a few days. In prolonged bleeding, however, symptoms may subside after weeks or months or not at all. Severe hemophilic arthrosis may be accompanied by fever and leukocytosis; severe, prolonged, or repeated bleeding may lead to chronic hemophilic joint disease. Effective treatment includes I.V. infusion of the deficient clotting factor, bed rest with the affected extremity elevated, application of ice packs, analgesics, and joint aspiration. Physical therapy includes progressive range- of-motion and muscle-strengthening exercises to restore motion and to prevent contractures and muscle atrophy. Intermittent hydrarthrosis Intermittent hydrarthrosis is a rare, benign condition characterized by regular, recurrent joint effusions. It most commonly affects the knee. The patient may have difficulty moving the affected joint but have no other arthritic symptoms. The cause of intermittent hydrarthrosis is unknown; onset is usually at or soon after puberty and may be linked to familial tendencies, allergies, or menstruation. No effective treatment exists. Sch\\u00f6nlein-Henoch purpura Sch\\u00f6nlein-Henoch purpura \\u2014 a vasculitic syndrome \\u2014 is marked by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, and arthralgia that most commonly affects the knees and ankles, producing swollen, warm, and tender joints without joint erosion or deformity. Renal involvement is also common. Most patients have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria 4 to 8 weeks after onset. Incidence is highest in children and young adults, occurring most often in the spring after a respiratory infection. Treatment may include corticosteroids. Traumatic arthritis Traumatic arthritis results from blunt, penetrating, or repeated trauma or from forced inappropriate motion of a joint or ligament. Clinical effects may include swelling, pain, tenderness, joint\\ninstability, and internal bleeding. Treatment includes analgesics, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, application of cold followed by heat and, if needed, compression dressings, splinting, joint aspiration,\\ncasting, or possibly surgery. Special considerations Management of septic arthritis demands meticulous supportive care, close observation, and control of infection. Practice strict sterile technique for all procedures. Wash hands carefully before and after giving care. Dispose of soiled linens and dressings properly. Prevent contact between immunosuppressed patients and infected patients. Watch for signs of joint inflammation: heat, redness, swelling, pain, or drainage. Monitor vital signs and fever pattern. Remember that corticosteroids mask signs of infection. P Check splints or traction regularly. Keep the joint in proper alignment, but avoid prolonged immobilization. Start\\npassive range-of-motion exercises immediately, and progress to active exercises as soon as the patient can move the affected joint and put weight on it. Monitor pain levels and medicate accordingly, especially before exercise, remembering that the pain of septic arthritis is easy to underestimate. Administer analgesics and opioids for acute pain and heat or ice packs for moderate pain. ELDER TIP Monitor older adults who are on long-term opioid therapy because these drugs can impair mental status and may contribute to falls and other accidents. Warn the patient before the first aspiration that it will be extremely painful. Carefully evaluate the patient's condition after joint aspiration. Gout Gout, also called gouty arthritis, is a metabolic disease marked by urate deposits, which cause painfully arthritic joints. (See Gouty deposits. )\\nIt can strike any joint but favors those in the feet and legs. Gout follows an intermittent course and typically leaves patients totally free from symptoms for years between attacks. It can cause chronic disability or incapacitation and, rarely, severe hypertension and progressive renal disease. The prognosis is good with treatment. Causes and incidence Although the exact cause of primary gout remains unknown,\\nit appears to be linked to a genetic defect in purine metabolism, which\\ncauses elevated blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) due to overproduction of uric acid, retention of uric acid, or both. In secondary gout, which develops during the course of another disease (such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and renal disease), hyperuricemia results from the breakdown of nucleic acids. Myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases, psoriasis, and hemolytic anemia are the most common causes. Primary gout usually occurs in men and in postmenopausal women; secondary gout occurs in elderly people. Secondary gout can also follow drug therapy that interferes with uric acid excretion. Increased concentration of uric acid leads to urate deposits ( tophi ) in joints or tissues and consequent local necrosis or fibrosis. The risk is\\ngreater in men, postmenopausal women, and those who use alcohol. GOUTY DEPOSITS The final stage of gout is marked by painful polyarthritis, with large, subcutaneous, tophaceous deposits in cartilage, synovial membranes, tendons, and soft tissue. The skin over the tophus is shiny, thin, and taut. Complications Renal calculi Atherosclerotic disease Cardiovascular disease Stroke Coronary thrombosis Hypertension Infection when tophi rupture Signs and symptoms P Gout develops in four stages: asymptomatic, acute, intercritical, and chronic. In asymptomatic gout, serum urate levels rise but produce no symptoms. As the disease progresses, it may cause hypertension or nephrolithiasis, with severe back pain. The first acute attack strikes suddenly and peaks quickly. Although it generally involves only one or a few joints, this initial attack is extremely painful. Affected joints are hot, tender, inflamed, and appear dusky-red\\nor cyanotic. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe usually becomes inflamed first (podagra), followed by the instep, ankle, heel, knee, or wrist joints. Sometimes a\\nlow-grade fever is present. Mild acute attacks usually subside quickly but tend to recur at irregular intervals. Severe attacks may persist for\\ndays or weeks. UNDERSTANDING PSEUDOGOUT Also known as calcium pyrophosphate disease, pseudogout results when calcium pyrophosphate crystals collect in periarticular joint structures. Signs and symptoms Like true gout, pseudogout causes sudden joint pain and swelling, most commonly of the knee, wrist, and ankle or other peripheral joints. Pseudogout attacks are self-limiting and triggered by stress, trauma, surgery, severe dieting, thiazide therapy, or alcohol abuse. Associated symptoms resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Many patients may be asymptomatic. Establishing a diagnosis Diagnosis of pseudogout hinges on joint aspiration and synovial biopsy to detect calcium pyrophosphate crystals. X-rays show calcium deposits in the fibrocartilage and linear markings along the bone ends. Blood tests may detect an underlying endocrine or metabolic disorder. Relief for pressure and inflammation Management of pseudogout may include aspirating the joint\\nto relieve pressure; instilling corticosteroids and administering analgesics, salicylates, phenylbutazone, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat inflammation and, if appropriate, treating the underlying disorder. Without treatment, pseudogout leads to permanent joint damage in about half of those it affects, most of whom are older adults. Intercritical periods are the symptomfree intervals between gout attacks. Most patients have a second attack within 6 months\\nto 2 years, but in some the second attack doesn't occur for 5 to 10 years. Delayed attacks are more common in untreated patients and tend to\\nbe longer and more severe than initial attacks. Such attacks are also polyarticular, invariably affecting joints in the feet and legs, and are\\nsometimes accompanied by fever. A migratory attack sequentially strikes\\nvarious joints and the Achilles tendon and is associated with either subdeltoid or olecranon bursitis. Eventually, chronic polyarticular gout sets in. This final, unremitting stage of the disease is marked by persistent painful polyarthritis, with large, subcutaneous tophi in cartilage, synovial membranes, tendons, and soft tissue. Tophi form in fingers, hands, knees, feet, ulnar sides of the forearms, helix of the ear, Achilles tendons and, rarely, internal organs, such as the kidneys and myocardium. The skin over the tophus may ulcerate and release a chalky, white exudate or pus. Chronic inflammation and tophaceous deposits precipitate secondary joint degeneration, with eventual erosions, deformity, and disability. Kidney involvement, with associated tubular damage, leads to chronic renal dysfunction. Hypertension and albuminuria\\noccur in some patients; urolithiasis is common. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The presence of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in synovial fluid taken from an inflamed joint or tophus establishes the diagnosis. P Aspiration of synovial fluid (arthrocentesis) or of tophaceous material reveals needlelike intracellular crystals of sodium urate. Although hyperuricemia isn't specifically diagnostic of gout, serum uric acid is above normal. Urinary uric acid is usually higher in secondary gout than in primary gout. In acute attacks, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell (WBC) count may be elevated, and WBC count shifts to the left. PREVENTION PREVENTING GOUT Because the cause of gout is unknown, the disease can't be prevented. However, it's important to teach your patients how to prevent acute gout attacks to reduce the risk of joint damage. Acute gout attacks can be prevented by dietary changes, weight reduction, adequate fluid intake, and drugs. Dietary restrictions Dietary changes include avoidance of foods high in purine , such as alcohol (especially beer and wine), organ meats, sardines, sweetbreads, peas, and lentils. Weight reduction Obese patients need to lose weight at a slow rate. Losing weight rapidly may temporarily increase uric acid levels. Fluid intake It's also important to drink adequate amounts of fluids to dilute the amount of uric acid in the blood. This will help decrease the risk of kidney stone formation. Taking the prescribed drug slows the\\nproduction of uric acid and speeds its elimination from the body. Initially, X-rays are normal. However, in chronic gout, X-rays show \\u201cpunched out\\u201d erosions, sometimes with periosteal overgrowth. Outward displacement of the overhanging margin from the bone\\ncontour characterizes gout. X-rays rarely show tophi. (See Understanding pseudogout. ) Treatment Correct management seeks to terminate an acute attack, reduce hyperuricemia, and prevent recurrence, complications, and the formation of renal calculi. (See Preventing gout. )\\nColchicine is effective in reducing pain, swelling, and inflammation; pain often subsides within 12 hours of treatment and is completely relieved in 48 hours. Treatment for the patient with acute gout consists\\nof bed rest; immobilization and protection of the inflamed, painful joints; and local application of heat or cold, whichever works for the patient. Maximal doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usually provide excellent relief for patients who can tolerate them; doses should be gradually reduced after several days. ELDER TIP Older patients are at risk for GI bleeding associated with NSAID use. Encourage the elderly patient to take these drugs with meals, and monitor the patient's stools for occult\\nblood. Resistant inflammation may require oral corticosteroids or intra-articular corticosteroid injection to relieve pain. Treatment for chronic gout aims to decrease serum uric acid level. Continuing maintenance dosage of allopurinol may be given to suppress uric acid formation or control uric acid levels, preventing further attacks. However, this powerful drug should be used cautiously in patients with renal failure. Uricosuric agents promote uric acid excretion and inhibit\\naccumulation of uric acid, but their value is limited in patients with renal impairment. These medications shouldn't be given to patients with renal calculi. Adjunctive therapy emphasizes a few dietary restrictions,\\nprimarily the avoidance of alcohol and purine-rich foods (organ meats, beer, wine, and certain types of fish are high in purines). Obese patients should try to lose weight because obesity puts additional stress on painful joints. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve joint function or correct deformities. Tophi must be excised and drained if they become P infected or ulcerated. They can also be excised to prevent ulceration, improve the patient's appearance, or make it easier for him to wear shoes or gloves. Special considerations Patient care for gout includes these interventions: Encourage bed rest but use a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off extremely sensitive, inflamed joints. Give pain medication, as needed, especially during acute attacks. Apply hot or cold packs to inflamed joints according to what the patient finds effective. Administer anti-inflammatory medication and other drugs, as ordered. Watch for adverse effects. Be alert for GI disturbances with colchicine. Watch for acute gout attacks 24 to 96 hours after surgery. Even minor surgery can precipitate an attack. Before and after surgery, administer colchicine as ordered, to help prevent gout attacks. Tell the patient to avoid high-purine foods, such as anchovies, liver, sardines, kidneys, sweetbreads, lentils, and alcoholic beverages\\u2014 especially beer and wine \\u2014 which raise the urate level. Explain the principles of a gradual weight-reduction diet to obese patients. Advise the patient to report any adverse effects of allopurinol, such as drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,\\nurinary frequency, or dermatitis. Neurogenic arthropathy Neurogenic arthropathy, also called Charcot's arthropathy, is a progressively degenerative disease of peripheral and axial joints, resulting from impaired sensory innervation. The loss of sensation in the joints causes progressive deterioration, resulting from trauma or primary disease, which leads to laxity of supporting ligaments and eventual disintegration of the affected joints. Causes and incidence Neurogenic arthropathy is most common in men older than 40 years. In adults, the most common cause of neurogenic arthropathy is diabetes mellitus. Other causes include tabes dorsalis (especially among\\npatients age 40 to 60), syringomyelia (progresses to neurogenic arthropathy in about 25% of patients), myelopathy of pernicious anemia, spinal cord trauma, paraplegia, hereditary sensory neuropathy, and Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease. Amyloidosis, peripheral nerve injury, myelomeningocele (in children), leprosy, and alcoholism may cause neurogenic arthropathy, but only in rare occurrences. Frequent intra-articular injection of corticosteroids has\\nalso been linked to neurogenic arthropathy. The analgesic effect of the\\ncorticosteroids may mask symptoms and allow continuous stress to accelerate joint destruction. Complications Joint subluxation or dislocation Pathologic fractures Infection Pseudogout Neurovascular compression Signs and symptoms Neurogenic arthropathy begins insidiously with swelling, warmth, decreased mobility, and instability in a single joint or in many\\njoints. It can progress to deformity. The first clue to vertebral neuroarthropathy, which progresses to gross spinal deformity, may be nothing more than a mild, persistent backache. Characteristically, pain is minimal despite obvious deformity. The specific joint affected varies according to the underlying cause. Diabetes usually attacks the joints and bones of the feet; tabes dorsalis attacks the large weight-bearing joints, such as the knee, hip, ankle, or lumbar and dorsal vertebrae (Charcot spine); syringomyelia causes occurrence in the shoulder, elbow, or cervical intervertebral joint. P Neurogenic arthropathy caused by intra-articular injection of corticosteroids usually develops in the hip or knee joint. Diagnosis Patient history of painless joint deformity and underlying primary disease suggests neurogenic arthropathy. Physical examination may reveal bone fragmentation in advanced disease. X-rays confirm diagnosis and assess severity of joint damage. In the early stage of the disease, soft-tissue swelling or effusion may be the only overt effect; in the advanced stage, articular fracture, subluxation, erosion of articular cartilage, periosteal new bone formation, and excessive growth of marginal loose bodies (osteophytosis) or resorption may be seen. Computed tomography scan helps define the extent of disease. Other diagnostic measures include: vertebral examination: narrowing of disk spaces, deterioration of vertebrae, and osteophyte formation, leading to\\nankylosis and deforming kyphoscoliosis synovial biopsy: bony fragments and bits of calcified cartilage. Treatment Effective management relieves pain with analgesics and immobilization using crutches, splints, braces, and restriction of weight bearing to the affected joint. In severe disease, surgery may include arthrodesis or, in\\nsevere diabetic neuropathy, amputation. However, surgery risks further damage through nonunion and infection. Special considerations Assess the pattern of pain and give analgesics, as needed. Check sensory perception, range of motion, alignment, joint swelling, and the status of underlying disease. Teach the patient to use joint protection techniques, to avoid physically stressful actions that may cause pathologic fractures, and to take safety precautions, such as removing throw rugs and other objects over which the patient may trip. Advise the patient to report severe joint pain, swelling, or instability. Warm compresses may be applied to relieve local pain and tenderness. Instruct the patient in the proper technique for crutches or other orthopedic devices. Stress the importance of proper fitting and regular professional readjustment of such devices. Warn the patient that impaired sensation might allow damage from these aids to occur and progress without discomfort. Emphasize the need to continue regular treatment of the underlying disease. Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, is a chronic disease that causes deterioration of the joint cartilage and formation of reactive new bone at the margins and subchondral areas of the joints. This degeneration results from a breakdown of chondrocytes, most commonly in the distal interphalangeal and proximal interphalangeal\\njoints, but also in the hip and knee joints. Osteoarthritis is widespread, occurring equally in both sexes. Its earliest symptoms typically begin after age 40 and may progress with advancing age. Disability depends on the site and severity of involvement and can range from minor limitation of the dexterity of the fingers to severe disability in persons with hip or knee involvement. The rate of progression varies, and joints may remain stable for years in an early stage of deterioration. Causes and incidence Studies indicate that osteoarthritis is acquired and probably results from a combination of metabolic, genetic, chemical, and\\nmechanical factors. Secondary osteoarthritis usually follows an identifiable predisposing event\\u2014most commonly trauma, metabolic conditions, congenital deformity, or obesity\\u2014and leads to degenerative changes. P Osteoarthritis may first appear between ages 30 and 40, and is present in almost everyone by age 70. Before age 55, it affects men and women equally, but after age 55 the incidence is higher in women. ELDER TIP Primary osteoarthritis is strongly associated with aging, and indeed aging may predispose to the cartilage degeneration common in persons with osteoarthritis. Complications Flexion contractures Subluxation and deformity Ankylosis Bony cysts Gross bone overgrowth Central cord syndrome Nerve root compression PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN OSTEOARTHRITIS The characteristic breakdown of articular cartilage is a gradual response to aging or to predisposing factors, such as joint abnormalities or traumatic injury. Cauda equina syndrome Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is a deep, aching joint pain, particularly after exercise or weight bearing, usually relieved by rest. Other symptoms include stiffness in the morning and after exercise (relieved by rest), aching during changes in weather, \\u201cgrating\\u201d of the joint during motion, altered gait contractures, joint instability, and limited movement. These symptoms increase with poor posture, obesity, and stress to the affected joint. Osteoarthritis of the interphalangeal joints produces irreversible joint changes and node formation. The nodes eventually become red, swollen, and tender, causing numbness and loss of dexterity.\\n(See What happens in osteoarthritis. ) Diagnosis A thorough physical examination confirms typical symptoms, and absence of systemic symptoms rules out an inflammatory joint disorder. X-rays of the affected joint help confirm diagnosis of osteoarthritis but may be normal in the early stages. X-rays may require\\nmany views and typically show: narrowing of joint space or margin cystlike bony deposits in joint space and margins and sclerosis of the subchondral space joint deformity due to degeneration or articular damage bony growths at weight-bearing areas fusion of joints. (See Digital joint deformities. ) MRI and CT may be used to show cartilage breakdown and bone abnormalities. Importantly, MRI can detect signs of inflammation of\\nthe bone or the synovial membrane. Treatment Treatment is aimed at relieving pain, maintaining or improving mobility, and minimizing disability. Medications include nonsteroidal anti- P inflammatory drugs, COX-2 inhibitors and, in some cases, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids. Studies indicate that glucosamine and chondroitin may be useful in controlling symptoms and reducing functional impairment. Injecting artificial joint fluid into the knee can provide relief of pain for up to 6 months. Effective treatment also reduces stress by weight loss and supporting or stabilizing the joint with crutches, braces, cane, walker, cervical collar, or traction. Exercise, such as through physical\\ntherapy, is integral to maintaining or improving joint mobility. Other supportive measures include massage, moist heat, paraffin dips for hands, protective techniques to prevent undue stress on the joints, and adequate rest (particularly after activity). Surgical treatment, such as one of the following, is reserved for patients who have severe disability or uncontrollable pain: Arthroplasty (partial or total): replacement of deteriorated part of joint with prosthetic appliance Arthrodesis: surgical fusion of bones, used primarily in spine (laminectomy) Osteoplasty: scraping and lavage of deteriorated bone from joint Osteotomy: change in alignment of bone to relieve stress by excision of wedge of bone or cutting of bone. Special considerations Patient care for osteoarthritis includes the following: Promote adequate rest, particularly after activity. Plan rest periods during the day, and provide for adequate sleep at night. Moderation is the key \\u2014 teach the patient to pace daily activities. Assist with physical therapy, and encourage the patient to perform gentle, isometric range-of-motion exercises. Provide emotional support and reassurance to help the patient cope with limited mobility. Explain that osteoarthritis isn't a systemic disease. Specific patient care depends on the affected joint: Hand: Apply hot soaks and paraffin dips to relieve pain, as ordered. Spine (lumbar and sacral): Recommend a firm mattress (or bed board) to decrease morning pain. Spine (cervical): Check cervical collar for constriction; watch for redness with prolonged use. DIGITAL JOINT DEFORMITIES Osteoarthritis of the interphalangeal joints produces irreversible changes in the distal joints (Heberden's nodes, below left)\\nand the proximal joints (Bouchard's nodes, below right). Initially painless, these nodes gradually progress to or suddenly flare up, resulting in redness, swelling, tenderness, and impaired sensation and dexterity. Hip: Use moist\\nheat pads to relieve pain and administer antispasmodic drugs, as ordered. Assist with range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, always\\nmaking sure the patient gets the proper rest afterward. Check crutches,\\ncane, braces, and walker for proper fit, and teach the patient to use them correctly. For example, the patient with unilateral joint involvement should use an orthopedic appliance such as a walker, or a cane. Recommend the use of cushions when sitting as well as the use of an elevated toilet seat. Knee: Twice daily, assist with prescribed range-of-motion exercises, exercises to maintain muscle tone, and progressive resistance P exercises to increase muscle strength. Provide elastic supports or braces if needed. To minimize the long-term effects of osteoarthritis: Teach the patient to take medication exactly as prescribed, and report adverse effects immediately. Advise the patient to avoid overexertion. He should take care to stand and walk correctly, to minimize weight-bearing activities, and to be especially careful when stooping or\\npicking up objects. Instruct the patient to wear properfitting, supportive shoes and not to allow the heels to become worn down. Advise the patient to install safety devices at home such as guard rails in the bathroom. Instruct the patient to maintain proper body weight to lessen strain on joints. BONES Osteomyelitis Osteomyelitis is a pyogenic bone infection that may be chronic or acute. It commonly results from a combination of local trauma, which is usually quite trivial but results in hematoma formation, and an acute infection originating elsewhere in the body. Although osteomyelitis usually remains localized, it can spread through the bone to the marrow, cortex, and periosteum. Acute osteomyelitis is usually a blood-borne disease, which most commonly affects rapidly growing children. Chronic osteomyelitis, which is rare, is characterized\\nby multiple draining sinus tracts and metastatic lesions. Causes and incidence Virtually any pathogenic bacteria can cause osteomyelitis\\nunder the right circumstances. Typically, these organisms find a culture site in a hematoma from recent trauma or in a weakened area, such as the site of surgery or local infection (for example, furunculosis), and spread directly to bone. As the organisms grow and form pus within the bone, tension builds within the rigid medullary cavity, forcing pus through the haversian canals. This forms a subperiosteal abscess that deprives the bone of its blood supply and may\\neventually cause necrosis. In turn, necrosis stimulates the periosteum to create new bone (involucrum); the old bone (sequestrum) detaches and works its way out through an abscess or the sinuses. By the time sequestrum forms, osteomyelitis is chronic. Osteomyelitis occurs more commonly in children (especially boys) than in adults\\u2014 usually as a complication of an acute localized infection. The most common sites in children are the lower end\\nof the femur and the upper end of the tibia, humerus, and radius. The most common sites in adults are the pelvis and vertebrae, generally as a\\nresult of contamination associated with surgery or trauma. Other common\\nsites are sternoclavicular, sacroiliac, and symphysis pubis. The incidence of both chronic and acute osteomyelitis is declining, except in drug abusers. With prompt treatment, the prognosis for acute osteomyelitis is very good; for chronic osteomyelitis, which is more prevalent in adults, the prognosis is still poor. Complications Chronic osteomylelitis Poor joint function Amputation of limb Signs and symptoms Onset of acute osteomyelitis is usually rapid, with sudden pain accompanied by tenderness, heat, swelling, and restricted movement of the affected area. Associated systemic symptoms may include tachycardia, sudden fever, nausea, and malaise. Generally, the clinical features of both chronic and acute osteomyelitis are the same, except that chronic infection can persist intermittently for years, flaring up spontaneously after minor trauma. Sometimes, however, the only symptom of chronic infection is the persistent drainage of pus from an old pocket in a sinus tract. P Diagnosis Patient history, physical examination, and blood tests help to confirm osteomyelitis: White blood cell count shows leukocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is usually elevated but nonspecific in acute cases. Cultures of the lesion indicate the source of the organism. Blood cultures help identify causative organism. Magnetic resonance imaging is best for detecting spinal infection. Computed tomography is best for visualizing islands of dead bone. X-rays may not show bone involvement until the disease has been active for some time, usually 2 to 3 weeks. Bone scans can detect early infection. Diagnosis must rule out poliomyelitis, rheumatic\\nfever, myositis, and bone fractures. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis is histopathologic and microscopic examination of bone. Treatment Treatment for acute osteomyelitis should begin before definitive diagnosis. Treatment includes administration of antibiotics after blood cultures are taken; early surgical drainage to relieve pressure buildup and sequestrum formation; immobilization of the affected bone by plaster cast, traction, or bed rest; and supportive measures, such as analgesics and I.V. fluids. If an abscess forms, treatment includes incision and drainage, followed by a culture of the drained fluid. Intracavitary instillation of antibiotics may be done through closed-system continuous\\nirrigation with low intermittent suction; limited irrigation with blood\\ndrainage system with suction; or local application of packed, wet, antibiotic-soaked dressings. In addition to these therapies, chronic osteomyelitis usually requires surgery to remove dead bone (sequestrectomy) and to promote drainage (saucerization). The area may be filled with bone graft or packing material to promote new bone tissue. An infected prosthesis is removed and a new one is implanted the same day or after resolution of the infection. Some centers use hyperbaric oxygen to increase the activity of naturally occurring leukocytes. Free-tissue transfers and local muscle flaps are also used to fill in dead space and increase blood supply. Special considerations Your major concerns are to control infection, protect the bone from injury, and offer meticulous supportive care. Use strict sterile technique when changing\\ndressings and irrigating wounds. If the patient is in skeletal traction\\nfor compound fractures, cover insertion points of pin tracks with small, dry dressings, and tell him not to touch the skin around the pins\\nand wires. Administer I.V. fluids to maintain adequate hydration as necessary. Provide a diet high in protein and vitamin C. Assess vital signs, wound appearance, and new pain, which may indicate secondary infection, daily. Carefully monitor suctioning equipment, and the amount of solution it instills and suctions. Support the affected limb with firm pillows. Keep the limb level with the body; don't let it sag. Turn the patient gently every 2 hours and watch for signs of developing pressure ulcers. Report any signs of pressure ulcer formation immediately. Support the cast with firm pillows and smooth rough cast edges by petaling with pieces of adhesive tape or moleskin. Check circulation and drainage; if a wet spot appears on the cast, circle it with a marking pen, and note the time of appearance (on the cast). Be aware of how much drainage is expected. Check the circled spot at least every 4 hours. Report any enlargement immediately. P Protect the patient from mishaps, such as jerky movements and falls, which may threaten bone integrity. Report sudden pain, crepitus, or deformity immediately. Watch for any sudden malposition of the limb, which may indicate fracture. Provide emotional support and appropriate diversions. Before discharge, teach the patient how to protect and clean\\nthe wound and, most importantly, how to recognize signs of recurring infection (increased temperature, redness, localized heat, and swelling). Stress the need for follow-up examinations. Instruct the patient to seek prompt treatment for possible sources of recurrence\\u2014blisters, boils, styes, and impetigo. Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder in which the rate of bone resorption accelerates while the rate of bone formation slows down, causing a loss of bone mass. Bones affected by this disease lose calcium and phosphate salts and thus become porous, brittle, and abnormally vulnerable to fractures. Osteoporosis may be primary or secondary to an underlying disease. Primary osteoporosis is commonly called postmenopausal osteoporosis because it typically develops in postmenopausal women. Causes and incidence The cause of primary osteoporosis is unknown; however, a mild but prolonged negative calcium balance, resulting from an inadequate dietary intake of calcium, may be an important contributing factor\\u2014as may declining gonadal or adrenal function, faulty protein metabolism due to estrogen deficiency, and sedentary lifestyle. (See Preventing osteoporosis. )\\nCauses of secondary osteoporosis are many: prolonged therapy with steroids or heparin, cigarette smoking, total immobilization or disuse of a bone (as with hemiplegia, for example), alcoholism, malnutrition, malabsorption, celiac disease, scurvy, lactose intolerance, osteogenesis\\nimperfecta, Sudeck's atrophy (localized to hands and feet, with recurring attacks), and endocrine disorders (hypopituitarism, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, longstanding diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism). The incidence of osteoporosis is high, with an estimated 10 million U.S. residents suffering from osteoporosis and another 18 million suffering from low bone mass, or osteopenia. Incidence is higher\\nin women than in men, with women older than age 50 accounting for 20% of cases. Another 30% of women have osteopenia, which can deteriorate into osteoporosis. Complication Bone fractures, especially in vertebrae, femoral neck, and distal radius Signs and symptoms Osteoporosis is usually discovered incidentally on roentgenograms; the patient may have been asymptomatic for years. Vertebral collapse, causing a backache with pain that radiates around the trunk, is the most common presenting feature. Any movement or jarring aggravates the backache. In another common pattern, osteoporosis can develop insidiously, with increasing deformity, kyphosis, and loss of height. Sometimes a dowager hump is present. As bones weaken, spontaneous wedge fractures, pathologic fractures of the neck or femur, Colles' fractures after a minor fall, and hip fractures become increasingly common. ELDER TIP Osteoporosis usually affects older people and is a major risk factor in vertebral compression fractures and hip fractures. Osteoporosis primarily affects the weight-bearing vertebrae. Only when the condition is advanced or severe, as in Cushing's syndrome or hyperthyroidism, do comparable changes occur in the skull, ribs, and long bones. Diagnosis P Differential diagnosis must exclude other causes of rarefying bone disease, especially those affecting the spine, such as metastatic cancer and advanced multiple myeloma. The differential diagnosis should also exclude osteomalacia, osteogenesis imperfecta tarda, skeletal hyperparathyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Initial evaluation attempts to identify the specific cause of osteoporosis through the patient history. Bone mineral density testing is performed in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and measures the mineralization of bones. It's the gold standard for evaluating osteoporosis. A spine computed tomography scan shows demineralization. Quantitative computed tomography can evaluate bone density but is less available and more expensive than DEXA. X-rays show fracture or vertebral collapse in severe cases. Urine calcium can provide evidence of bone\\nturnover but is limited in value. Newer tests include urinary N-telopeptide to help diagnose osteoporosis. Treatment Treatment aims to slow down or prevent bone loss, prevent\\nadditional fractures, and control pain. A physical therapy program that\\nemphasizes gentle exercise and activity is an important part of the treatment. Medications may include bisphosphonates, such as alendronate and risedronate, to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of fractures. The physician may also recommend adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. Raloxifene and calcitonin have also been prescribed. Weakened vertebrae should be supported, usually with a back brace. Surgery can correct pathologic fractures of the femur by open reduction and internal fixation. Colles' fracture requires reduction with plaster immobilization for 4 to 10 weeks. PREVENTION PREVENTING OSTEOPOROSIS To help prevent osteoporosis, tell the patient to follow these guidelines. Maintain adequate calcium and vitamin D intake Postmenopausal women and all men and women older than age\\n65 should consume 1,500 mg of calcium and at least 800 international units of vitamin D daily. Getting enough vitamin D is as important as getting enough calcium because vitamin D aids in absorption of calcium and improves muscle strength. Most people get adequate amounts of vitamin D from sunlight; however, this may not be a good source for those who live in high latitudes, are housebound, or regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun entirely because of the risk of skin cancer. Calcium supplements with added vitamin D are a good alternative. Exercise Exercise can help build strong bones and slow bone loss. Strength-training exercises should be combined with weight-bearing exercises. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in the arms and upper spine, and weight-bearing exercises mainly affect the bones in the legs, hips, and lower spine. Limit alcohol intake Consuming more than two alcoholic drinks a day may decrease bone formation and reduce the body's ability to absorb calcium. Limit caffeine Limit the amount of caffeinated beverages to about two to\\nthree cups of coffee a day. As long as the diet contains adequate calcium, moderate caffeine consumption won't harm you. Don't forget to count caffeine-containing beverages such as colas and teas. The incidence of primary osteoporosis may be reduced through adequate intake of dietary calcium and regular exercise. Fluoride treatments may also offer some preventive benefit. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) P with estrogen and progesterone may retard bone\\nloss and prevent the occurrence of fractures; however, this therapy remains controversial. HRT decreases bone reabsorption and increases bone mass. Secondary osteoporosis can be prevented through effective treatment of the underlying disease as well as corticosteroid therapy, early mobilization after surgery or trauma, careful observation for signs of malabsorption, and prompt treatment of hyperthyroidism. Men with osteoporosis, hypogonadism, and low libido may benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Decreased alcohol consumption and caffeine use, as well as smoking cessation, are also helpful preventive measures. Special considerations Your care plan should focus on the patient's fragility, stressing careful positioning, ambulation, and prescribed exercises. Check the patient's skin daily for redness, warmth, and new sites of pain, which may indicate new fractures. Encourage activity; help the patient walk several times daily. As appropriate, perform passive range-of-motion exercises or encourage the patient to perform active exercises. Make sure the patient\\nregularly attends scheduled physical therapy sessions. Impose safety precautions. Keep the side rails of the patient's bed in raised position. Move the patient gently and carefully at all times. Explain to the patient's family and ancillary health care personnel how easily an osteoporotic patient's bones can fracture. Provide a balanced diet, high in nutrients\\nthat support skeletal metabolism: vitamin D, calcium, and protein. Administer analgesics and heat to relieve pain. Make sure the patient and her family clearly understand the prescribed drug regimen. Tell them how to recognize significant adverse effects and to report them immediately. The patient should also report any new pain sites immediately, especially after trauma, no matter how slight. Advise the patient to sleep on a firm mattress and avoid excessive bed rest. Make sure she knows how to wear her back brace. Thoroughly explain osteoporosis to the patient and her family. If the patient and her family don't understand the nature of this disease, they may feel the fractures could have been prevented if they had been more careful. Teach the patient to use good body mechanics\\u2014to stoop before lifting anything and to avoid twisting movements and prolonged bending. Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease (also called coxa plana )\\nis ischemic necrosis that leads to eventual flattening of the head of the femur caused by vascular interruption. The disease occurs in five stages. Growth arrest: Avascular phase; may last 6\\nto 12 months. Early changes include inflammation and synovitis of the hip and ischemic changes in the ossific nucleus of the femoral head. Subchondral fracture: Radiographic visualization of the fracture varies with the age of the child at clinical onset and the extent of epiphyseal involvement; may last 3 to 8\\u00bd months. Reabsorption, also called fragmentation or necrosis: The necrotic bone beneath the subchondral fracture is gradually and irregularly reabsorbed; lasts 6 to 12 months. Reossification, or healing stage: Ossification of the primary bone begins irregularly in the subchondral area and progresses centrally; takes 6 to 24 months. Healed stage, also called residual stage: Complete ossification of the epiphysis of the femoral head, with or without residual deformity. Although this disease usually runs its course in 3 to 4 years, it may lead to premature osteoarthritis later in life from misalignment of the acetabulum and flattening of the femoral head. Causes and incidence The exact vascular obstructive changes that initiate Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease are unknown. Current etiological theories include venous obstruction with secondary intraepiphyseal thrombosis, trauma to P 9 retinacular vessels, vascular irregularities (congenital or developmental), vascular occlusion secondary to increased intracapsular pressure from acute transient synovitis, and increased blood viscosity resulting in stasis and decreased blood flow. Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease occurs most frequently in boys\\nages 4 to 10 and tends to occur in families. Although typically unilateral, it occurs bilaterally in 20% of patients. Complications Permanent disability Premature osteoarthritis Signs and symptoms The first indication of Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease is usually a persistent thigh pain or limp that becomes progressively severe. This symptom appears during the second stage, when bone resorption and deformity begin. Other effects may include mild pain in the hip, thigh, or knee that's aggravated by activity and relieved by rest; muscle spasm; atrophy of muscles in the upper thigh; slight shortening of the leg; and severely restricted abduction and internal rotation of the hip. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A thorough physical examination and clinical history suggest Legg-Calv\\u00e9-Perthes disease. Hip X-rays confirm the diagnosis, with findings that vary according to the stage of the disease. Anterior-posterior X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging enhance early diagnosis of necrosis and visualization of articular surface. Diagnostic evaluation must also differentiate between Legg-Calv\\u00e9- Perthes disease (restriction of only the abduction and rotation of the hip) and infection or arthritis (restriction of all motion). Aspiration and culture of synovial fluid rule out joint sepsis. Treatment The aim of treatment is to protect the femoral head from further stress and damage by containing it within the acetabulum. After 1\\nto 2 weeks of bed rest, therapy may include reduced weight bearing by means of bed rest in bilateral split counterpoised traction, then application of hip abduction splint or cast, or weight bearing while a splint, cast, or brace holds the leg in abduction. Braces may remain in place for 6 to 18 months. Analgesics help relieve pain. Physical therapy\\nwith passive and active range-of-motion exercises after cast removal helps restore motion. For a young child in the early stages of the disease, osteotomy and subtrochanteric derotation provide maximum confinement of the epiphysis within the acetabulum to allow return of the femoral head to normal shape and full range of motion. Proper placement of the epiphysis thus allows remolding with ambulation. Postoperatively, the patient requires a spica cast for about 2 months. Special considerations When caring for the hospitalized child, do the following. Monitor the patient's fluid intake and output. Maintain sufficient fluid balance. Provide a diet sufficient for\\ngrowth without causing excessive weight gain, which might necessitate cast change and loss of the corrective position. Provide cast care. Turn the child every 2 to 3 hours to expose the cast to air. When the cast is still wet, turn the child with your palms because depressions in the plaster may lead to\\npressure ulcers. After the cast dries, petal it with pieces of adhesive\\ntape or moleskin, changing them as they become soiled. Protect the cast\\nwith a plastic covering during each bowel movement. P Watch for circulatory or neurologic changes of the leg. Check toes for color, temperature, swelling, sensation, and motion; report dusky, cool, numb toes immediately. Check the skin under the cast with a flashlight every 4 hours while the patient is awake. Follow a consistent plan of skin care to prevent skin breakdown. Never use oils or powders under the cast because they increase skin breakdown and soften the cast. Check\\nunder the cast daily for odors, particularly after surgery, to detect skin breakdown or wound problems. Report persistent soreness. Relieve itching by using a hair dryer (set\\non cool) at the cast edges; this also decreases dampness from perspiration. If itching becomes excessive, get an order for an antipruritic. Never insert an object under the cast to scratch. Provide continuous emotional support. Explain all procedures and the need for bed rest, cast, or braces to the\\nchild; encourage him to verbalize his fears and anxiety. Encourage parents to participate in their child's care. Teach them proper cast care and how to recognize signs of skin breakdown. Offer tips for making\\nhome management of the bedridden child easier. Tell them what special supplies are needed: pajamas and trousers a size larger (open the side seam, and attach Velcro fasteners to close it), bedpan, adhesive tape, moleskin and, possibly, a hospital bed. When the cast is removed, debride dry, scaly skin gradually by applying lotion after bathing. Stress the need for follow-up care to monitor rehabilitation. Also stress home tutoring and socialization to promote normal mental and emotional growth and development. Osgood-Schlatter disease Osgood-Schlatter disease, also called osteochondrosis, is a painful, incomplete separation of the epiphysis of the tibial tubercle from the tibial shaft. This is the common cause of knee pain in\\nan adolescent. Severe disease may cause permanent tubercle enlargement. Causes and incidence Osgood-Schlatter probably results from trauma before the complete fusion of the epiphysis to the main bone has occurred (between ages 10 and 15). Other causes include locally deficient blood supply and\\ngenetic factors. It's most common in active adolescent boys, generally affecting one or both knees. It may occur in girls, typically between ages 10 and 11. Complications Irregular growth Partial avascular necrosis of proximal tibial epiphysis Signs and symptoms The patient complains of constant aching and pain and tenderness over the tibial tubercle, which worsens during any activity that causes forceful contraction of the patellar tendon on the tubercle,\\nsuch as ascending or descending stairs, running, squatting, jumping, or\\nforced flexion. The pain may be associated with some obvious soft-tissue swelling and localized heat and tenderness. Diagnosis Physical examination supports the diagnosis: the examiner\\nforces the tibia into internal rotation while slowly extending the patient's knee from 90 degrees of flexion; at about 30 degrees, flexion produces pain that subsides immediately with external rotation of the tibia. Visible soft tissue edema may be present over proximal tibial tuberosity with tenderness to palpation. Some patients' quadriceps may atrophy. X-rays may be normal or show epiphyseal separation and soft-tissue swelling for up to 6 months after onset; eventually, they may show bone fragmentation. Bone scan may show increased uptake in the area of the tibial tuberosity\\u2014even greater than the typical increased uptake in the normal epiphysis of the unaffected side. Treatment Osteochondrosis is usually self-limiting, and conservative treatment designed to reduce pain and decrease stress to the affected knee is usually adequate. Avoid strenuous exercises that involve the knee; use frequent ice applications after exercise for pain.\\nRest and quadriceps strengthening, hip extension, adductor strengthening, and hamstring and quadriceps-stretching exercises are recommended. Knee immobilization in extension for 6 to 8 weeks may be necessary. Analgesics and NSAIDs may be given for pain relief and reduction of local swelling. Rarely, conservative measures fail, and surgery may be necessary. Such surgery includes removal or fixation of the epiphysis or\\ndrilling holes through the tubercle to the main bone to form channels for rapid revascularization. Special considerations The following special considerations should be observed for patients with Osgood-Schlatter disease: Monitor the patient's circulation, sensation, and pain, and watch for excessive bleeding after surgery. Assess daily for limitation of motion. Administer analgesics as needed. Make sure knee support or splint isn't too\\ntight. Keep the cast dry and clean, and petal it around the top and bottom margins to avoid skin irritation. Teach proper use of crutches. Tell the patient to protect the injured knee with padding and to avoid trauma and repeated flexion (running, contact sports). Monitor for muscle atrophy. Give reassurance and emotional support because disruption of normal activities is difficult for an active teenager. Emphasize that restrictions are temporary. Paget's disease Paget's disease, also called osteitis deformans, is a slowly progressive metabolic bone disease characterized by an initial phase of excessive P bone resorption (osteoclastic phase), followed by a reactive phase of excessive abnormal bone formation (osteoblastic phase). The new bone structure, which is chaotic, fragile,\\nand weak, causes painful deformities of both external contour and internal structure. Paget's disease usually localizes in one or more areas of the skeleton, but occasionally skeletal deformity is widely distributed. The bones most frequently affected are pelvis, leg, spine, arm, collar, and skull. It can be fatal, particularly when it's associated with heart failure (widespread disease creates a continuous need for high cardiac output), bone sarcoma, or giant-cell tumors. Causes and incidence The disease occurs worldwide, but is more common in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, where it's seen in up to 5% of the elderly population. The incidence is higher in men than in women and usually occurs in patients older than age 40. Although its exact cause is unknown, one theory holds that early viral infection causes a dormant\\nskeletal infection that erupts many years later as Paget's disease. Genetic factors are also suspected. Complications Fractures Vertebral collapse Paraplegia Blindness and hearing loss (impingement on cranial nerves) Osteoarthritis Sarcoma Hypertension Renal calculi Hypercalcemia Gout Signs and symptoms Clinical effects of Paget's disease vary. Early stages may be asymptomatic, but when pain does develop, it's usually severe and persistent and may coexist with impaired movement resulting from impingement of abnormal bone on the spinal cord or sensory nerve root. Such pain intensifies with weight bearing. The patient with skull involvement shows characteristic cranial enlargement over frontal and occipital areas (hat size may increase) and may complain of headaches. Other deformities include kyphosis (spinal curvature due to compression fractures of pagetic vertebrae), accompanied by a barrel-shaped chest and asymmetrical bowing\\nof the tibia and femur, which commonly reduces height. Pagetic sites are warm and tender and are susceptible to pathologic fractures after minor trauma. Pagetic fractures heal slowly and usually incompletely. Bony impingement on the cranial nerves may cause blindness and hearing loss with tinnitus and vertigo. Other complications include hypertension, renal calculi, hypercalcemia, gout, heart failure, a waddling gait (from softening of pelvic bones), and hearing loss. Diagnosis X-rays taken before overt symptoms develop show increased\\nbone expansion and density. A bone scan, which is more sensitive than X-rays, clearly shows early pagetic lesions (radioisotope collects around areas of active disease). Computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging shows extra bony extension if sarcomatous degeneration\\noccurs. Bone biopsy reveals characteristic mosaic pattern. Other laboratory findings include: elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels (an index of osteoblastic activity and bone formation) elevated serum calcium. Increasing use of routine chemistry screens (including serum alkaline phosphatase) is making early diagnosis more common. Serum\\nosteocalcin and N-telopeptide are usually increased. P Treatment Primary treatment consists of drug therapy and includes one of the following: Calcitonin (subcutaneously or intranasally) is used to retard bone resorption (which relieves bone lesions) and reduce levels of serum alkaline phosphate and urinary hydroxyproline secretion. Although calcitonin therapy requires long-term\\nmaintenance, improvement is noticeable after the first few weeks of treatment. Bisphosphonates, such as etidronate, alendronate, pamidronate, tiludronate, and risedronate, produce rapid reduction in bone turnover and relieve pain. They also reduce serum alkaline phosphate and urinary hydroxyproline secretion. Therapy produces noticeable improvement after 1 to 3 months. Plicamycin, a cytotoxic antibiotic, is used to decrease calcium, urinary hydroxyproline, and serum alkaline phosphatase. It produces remission of symptoms within\\n2 weeks and biochemical improvement in 1 to 2 months. Plicamycin is used to control the disease and is reserved for severe cases with neurologic compromise and for those resistant to other therapies. However, it may destroy platelets or compromise renal function. Orthopedic surgery is used to correct specific deformities in severe cases, reduce or prevent pathologic fractures, correct secondary deformities, or relieve neurologic impairment. Joint replacement is difficult because bonding material (methyl methacrylate) doesn't set properly on pagetic bone. Other treatment varies according to symptoms. Analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be given to control pain. Special considerations Patients with Paget's disease require the following special considerations: To evaluate the effectiveness of analgesics, assess level of pain daily. Watch for new areas of pain or restricted movements, which may indicate new fracture sites, and sensory\\nor motor disturbances, such as difficulty in hearing, seeing, or walking. Monitor serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels. If the patient is confined to prolonged bed rest, prevent pressure ulcers by providing good skin care. Reposition the patient frequently, and use a flotation mattress. Provide\\nhigh-topped sneakers to prevent footdrop. Monitor intake and output. Encourage adequate fluid intake to minimize renal calculi formation. Demonstrate how to inject calcitonin properly and rotate injection sites or how to perform nasal inhalation if that's the form prescribed. Warn the patient that adverse effects may\\noccur (nausea, vomiting, local inflammatory reaction at injection site,\\nfacial flushing, itching of hands, and fever). Give reassurance that these adverse effects are usually mild and infrequent. To help the patient adjust to the changes in lifestyle imposed by this disease, teach him how to pace activities and, if necessary, how to use assistive devices. Encourage him to follow\\na recommended exercise program, avoiding both immobilization and excessive activity. Suggest a firm mattress or a bed board to minimize spinal deformities. Warn against imprudent use of analgesics because diminished sensitivity to pain resulting from analgesic use may make patient unaware of new fractures. To prevent falls at home, advise removal of throw rugs and other obstacles. Help the patient and his family make use of community support resources, such as a visiting nurse or home health agency. For more information, refer them to the Paget's Disease Foundation. Hallux valgus Hallux valgus is a lateral deviation of the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint. It occurs with medial enlargement of the first metatarsal head and bunion formation (bursa and callus formation at the bony prominence). P Causes and incidence Hallux valgus may be acquired or congenital. Acquired hallux valgus results from degenerative arthritis or prolonged pressure on the foot, especially from narrow-toed or high-heeled shoes that compress the forefoot. Bony alignment is normal at the outset of the disorder. This form typically occurs more frequently in women. In congenital hallux valgus, abnormal bony alignment \\u2014 increased space between first and second metatarsal (metatarsus primus varus) \\u2014 causes bunion formation. This form is usually first observed in\\nchildhood. Complications Foot deformity Difficulty walking Signs and symptoms Hallux valgus characteristically begins as a tender bunion covered by deformed, hard, erythematous skin and palpable bursa, typically distended with fluid. The first indication of hallux valgus may be pain over the bunion from shoe pressure. Pain can also stem from traumatic arthritis, bursitis, or abnormal stresses on the foot because hallux valgus changes the body's weight-bearing pattern. In\\nan advanced stage, a flat, splayed forefoot may occur, with severely curled toes (hammer toes) and formation of a small bunion on the fifth metatarsal. (See Hammer toe. ) Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A red, tender bunion makes hallux valgus obvious. X- rays confirm the diagnosis by showing medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the great toe. Treatment In the very early stages of acquired hallux valgus, good foot care and wide-toed shoes may eliminate the need for further treatment. Other useful measures for early management include felt pads to protect the bunion, foam pads or other devices to separate the first and second toes at night, and a supportive pad and exercises to strengthen the metatarsal arch. Early treatment is vital in patients predisposed to foot problems, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis or\\ndiabetes mellitus. If the disease progresses to severe deformity with disabling pain, bunionectomy is necessary. After surgery, the toe is immobilized in its corrected position in one of two ways: with a soft compression dressing that may cover the entire foot or just the great toe and the second toe, thereby serving as a splint, or with a short cast such as a light slipper spica cast. The patient may need crutches or controlled weight bearing. Depending on the extent of the surgery, some patients walk on their heels a few days after surgery; others must wait 4 to 6 weeks to bear weight on the affected foot. Supportive treatment may include physical therapy, such as warm compresses, soaks, and exercises, and analgesics to relieve pain and stiffness. Special considerations Before surgery, obtain a patient history and assess the neurovascular status of the foot (temperature, color, sensation, and blanching sign). If necessary, teach the patient how to walk with crutches. HAMMER TOE In hammer toe, the toe assumes a clawlike appearance from\\nhyperextension of the metatarsophalangeal joint, flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint, and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint, usually under pressure from hallux valgus displacement. A painful corn forms on the back of the interphalangeal joint and on the bone end, and a callus forms on the sole of the foot, both of which make walking painful. Hammer P toe may be mild or severe and\\ncan affect one toe or all five, as in clawfoot (which also causes a very high arch). Hammer toe can be congenital (and familial) or acquired from constantly wearing short, narrow shoes, which put pressure on the end of the long toe. Acquired hammer toe is commonly bilateral and often\\ndevelops in children who rapidly outgrow shoes and socks. In young children, or adults with early deformity, repeated foot manipulation and splinting of the affected toe relieve discomfort and may correct the deformity. Other treatment includes protection of protruding joints with felt pads, corrective footwear (open-toed shoes and sandals or special shoes that conform to the shape of the foot), the use of a metatarsal arch support, and exercises, such as passive manual stretching of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Severe deformity requires surgical fusion of the proximal interphalangeal joint in a straight position. After bunionectomy: Apply ice to reduce swelling. Support the patient's foot with pillows, elevate the foot of the bed, or put the bed\\nin a Trendelenburg position. Record the neurovascular status of the toes, including the patient's ability to move the toes (dressing may inhibit movement), every hour for the first 24 hours and then every 4 hours. Report any change in neurovascular status to the surgeon immediately. Prepare the patient for walking by having her dangle her foot over the side of the bed for a short time before standing, allowing a gradual increase in venous pressure. If crutches are needed, supervise the patient in using them, and make sure this skill is mastered before discharge. The patient should have a proper cast shoe or boot to protect the cast or dressing. Before discharge, instruct the patient to limit activities, to rest frequently with feet elevated, to elevate her feet whenever she feels pain or has edema, and to wear wide-toed shoes and sandals after the dressings are removed. Urge female patients not to\\nresume wearing high-heeled, pointy-toed shoes. Teach proper foot care, such as cleanliness, massages, and cutting toenails straight across to prevent ingrown nails and infection. Suggest exercises to do at home to strengthen foot muscles, such as standing at the edge of a step on the heel and then raising and inverting the top of the foot. Stress the importance of follow-up care and prompt medical attention for painful bunions, corns, and calluses. Kyphosis Kyphosis, also called roundback or hunchback, is an anteroposterior curving of the spine that causes a bowing of the back, commonly at the thoracic, but sometimes at the thoracolumbar or sacral, level. The normal spine displays some convexity, but excessive thoracic kyphosis is pathologic. Causes and incidence Kyphosis occurs in children and adults. Although congenital kyphosis is rare, it's usually severe, with resultant cosmetic deformity and reduced pulmonary function. Adolescent kyphosis (also called Scheuermann's disease, juvenile kyphosis, and vertebral epiphysitis ),\\nthe most common form of this disorder, may result from growth retardation or a vascular disturbance in the vertebral epiphysis (usually at the thoracic level) during periods of rapid growth or from congenital deficiency in the thickness of the vertebral plates. Other causes include infection, inflammation, aseptic necrosis, and disk degeneration. The subsequent stress of weight bearing on the compromised\\nvertebrae may result in the thoracic hump commonly seen in adolescents with kyphosis. Symptomatic adolescent kyphosis is more prevalent in girls than in boys and occurs most commonly between ages 12 and 16. P Adult kyphosis (adult roundback) may result from aging and associated degeneration of intervertebral disks, atrophy, and osteoporotic collapse of the vertebrae; from endocrine disorders, such as hyperparathyroidism and Cushing's disease; and from prolonged steroid\\ntherapy. Adult kyphosis may also result from conditions such as arthritis, Paget's disease, polio, compression fracture of the thoracic vertebrae, metastatic tumor, plasma cell myeloma, or tuberculosis (TB). In both children and adults, kyphosis may also result from poor posture. Disk lesions called Schmorl's nodes may develop in anteroposterior curving of the spine and are localized protrusions of nuclear material through the cartilage plates and into the spongy bone of the vertebral bodies. If the anterior portions of the\\ncartilage are destroyed, bridges of new bone may transverse the intervertebral space, causing ankylosis. Complications Debilitating back pain Leg weakness or paralysis Decreased lung capacity Signs and symptoms Development of adolescent kyphosis is usually insidious and may be asymptomatic except for the obvious curving of the back (sometimes more than 90 degrees). In some adolescents, kyphosis may produce mild pain at the apex of the curve (about 50% of patients), fatigue, tenderness or stiffness in the involved area or along the entire spine, and prominent vertebral spinous processes at the lower dorsal and upper lumbar levels, with compensatory increased lumbar lordosis, and hamstring tightness. Rarely, kyphosis may cause neurologic damage: spastic paraparesis secondary to spinal cord compression or herniated nucleus pulposus. In both adolescent and adult forms of kyphosis that aren't due to poor posture alone, the spine won't straighten when the patient assumes a recumbent position. Adult kyphosis produces a characteristic roundback appearance, possibly associated with pain, weakness of the back, and generalized fatigue. Unlike the adolescent form, adult kyphosis rarely produces local tenderness, except in osteoporosis with a recent compression fracture. Diagnosis Physical examination reveals curvature of the thoracic spine in varying degrees of severity. X-rays may show vertebral wedging,\\nSchmorl's nodes, irregular end plates, and possibly mild scoliosis of 10 to 20 degrees. Magnetic resonance imaging should be used to distinguish adolescent kyphosis from TB and other inflammatory or neoplastic diseases that cause vertebral collapse; the severe pain, bone destruction, or systemic symptoms associated with these diseases help rule out a diagnosis of kyphosis. Other sites of bone disease, primary sites of malignancy, and infection must also be evaluated, possibly through vertebral biopsy. Treatment For kyphosis caused by poor posture alone, treatment may consist of therapeutic exercises, bed rest on a firm mattress (with or without traction), and a brace to straighten the kyphotic curve until spinal growth is complete. Corrective exercises include pelvic tilt to decrease lumbar lordosis, hamstring stretch to overcome muscle contractures, and thoracic hyperextension to flatten the kyphotic curve.\\nThese exercises may be performed in or out of the brace. Lateral X-rays\\ntaken every 4 months evaluate correction. Gradual weaning from the brace can begin after maximum correction of the kyphotic curve and after vertebral wedging has decreased and the spine has reached full skeletal maturity. Loss of correction indicates that weaning from the brace has been too rapid, and time out of the brace is decreased accordingly. Treatment for both adolescent and adult kyphosis also includes appropriate measures for the underlying cause and, possibly, spinal arthrodesis for relief of symptoms. Although rarely necessary, surgery may be recommended when kyphosis causes neurologic damage, a spinal curve greater than 60 degrees, or intractable and disabling back pain in a patient with full skeletal maturity. Preoperative measures may\\ninclude halo-femoral traction. Corrective surgery includes a posterior spinal fusion with spinal instrumentation, iliac bone grafting, and plaster immobilization. Anterior spinal fusion followed by immobilization in P plaster may be necessary when kyphosis produces a spinal curve greater than 70 degrees. Special considerations Effective management of kyphosis necessitates first-rate supportive care for patients in traction or a brace, skillful patient teaching, and sensitive emotional support. Teach the patient with adolescent kyphosis\\ncaused by poor posture alone the prescribed therapeutic exercises and the fundamentals of good posture. Suggest bed rest when pain is severe. Encourage use of a firm mattress, preferably with a bed board. If the patient needs a brace, explain its purpose and teach him how and when to\\nwear it. Teach good skin care. Tell the patient not\\nto use lotions, ointments, or powders where the brace contacts the skin. Warn him that only the physician or orthotist should adjust the brace. If corrective surgery is needed, explain all preoperative tests thoroughly as well as the need for postoperative traction or casting, if applicable. After surgery, check neurovascular status every 2 to 4 hours for the first 48 hours, and report any changes\\nimmediately. Turn the patient often by logrolling and teach the patient\\nhow to logroll himself. Provide meticulous skin care. Check the skin at the cast edges several times a day; use heel and elbow protectors to prevent skin breakdown. Remove antiembolism stockings, if ordered, at least three times a day for at least 30 minutes. Change dressings as ordered. Provide emotional support. The adolescent patient is likely to exhibit mood changes and periods of depression. Maintain communication, and offer frequent encouragement and reassurance. Assist during removal of sutures and application of a new cast (usually about 10 days after surgery). Encourage gradual ambulation (usually with the use of a tilt table in the physical therapy department). At discharge, provide detailed, written cast care instructions. Tell the patient to immediately report pain, burning, skin breakdown, loss of feeling, tingling, numbness, or cast odor. Advise him to drink plenty of liquids to avoid constipation and to\\nreport any illness immediately. Arrange for home visits by a social worker and a home-care nurse, as needed. Herniated disk Herniated disk, also called ruptured or slipped disk and herniated nucleus pulposus, occurs when all or part of the nucleus pulposus \\u2014 the soft, gelatinous,\\ncentral portion of an intervertebral disk\\u2014is forced through the disk's weakened or torn outer ring (anulus fibrosus). When this happens, the extruded disk may impinge on spinal nerve roots as they exit from the spinal canal or on the spinal cord itself, resulting in back pain and other signs of nerve root irritation. Causes and incidence Herniated disks may result from severe trauma or strain or may be related to intervertebral joint degeneration. Although usually\\noccurring in adults (mostly men) less than 45 years old, elderly people\\nare also at risk because minor trauma may cause herniation in disks that have begun to deteriorate due to age. Ninety percent of herniation occurs in the lumbar and lumbosacral regions of the spine; 8% in the cervical region; and 1% to 2% in the thoracic region. Patients with a congenitally small lumbar spinal canal or with osteophyte formation on the vertebrae may be more susceptible to nerve root compression by a herniated disk and more likely to have neurologic symptoms. Complications Long-term back pain Rarely, spinal cord injuries, such as, loss of movement or sensation in legs and feet, a loss of bowel and bladder function. Signs and symptoms The overriding symptom of lumbar herniated disk is severe\\nlow-back pain that radiates to the buttocks, legs, and feet, usually unilaterally. When herniation follows trauma, the pain may begin suddenly, subside in P a few days, and then recur at shorter intervals and\\nwith progressive intensity. Sciatic pain follows, beginning as a dull pain in the buttocks. Valsalva's maneuver, coughing, sneezing, or bending intensifies the pain, which is commonly accompanied by muscle spasms. Herniated disk may also cause paresthesias or hyperthesias, as well as sensory and motor loss in the area innervated by the compressed spinal nerve root and, in later stages, weakness and atrophy of leg muscles. Diagnosis Obtaining a careful patient history is vital because the events that intensify disk pain are diagnostically significant. The straight-leg-raising test and its variants are perhaps the best tests for herniated disk, but may still be negative. For the straight-leg-raising test, the patient lies in a supine position while the examiner places one hand on the patient's ilium, to stabilize the pelvis, and the other hand under the ankle, then\\nslowly raises the patient's leg. The test is positive only if the patient complains of posterior leg (sciatic) pain, not back pain. In Las\\u00e8gue test, the patient lies flat while the thigh and knee are flexed to a 90-degree angle. Resistance and pain as well as loss of ankle or knee-jerk reflex indicate spinal root compression. X-rays of the spine are essential to rule out other abnormalities but may not diagnose herniated disk because marked disk prolapse can be present despite a normal X-ray. A thorough check of the patient's peripheral vascular status \\u2014 including posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses and skin temperature of limbs \\u2014 helps rule out ischemic disease, another cause of leg pain or numbness. After physical examination and X-rays, myelography, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide the most specific diagnostic information, showing spinal canal compression by herniated disk material. MRI is the method of choice to confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact level of herniation. A myelogram can define the size\\nand location of disk herniation. An electromyogram can determine the exact nerve root involved. A nerve conduction velocity test may also be performed. Treatment Unless neurologic impairment progresses rapidly, treatment is initially conservative and consists of several weeks of bed\\nrest (possibly with pelvic traction), administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heat applications, and an exercise program. Epidural corticosteroids, short-term oral corticosteroids, nerve root blocks, or physical therapy may be used to decrease pain. Muscle relaxants, such as diazepam, methocarbamol, or cyclobenzaprine, may relieve associated muscle spasms. A herniated disk that fails to respond to conservative treatment may necessitate surgery. The most common procedure, laminectomy, involves excision of a portion of the lamina and removal of\\nthe protruding disk. If laminectomy doesn't alleviate pain and disability, a spinal fusion may be necessary to overcome segmental instability. Laminectomy and spinal fusion are sometimes performed concurrently to stabilize the spine. Microdiskectomy can also be used to\\nremove fragments of nucleus pulposus. Injection of the enzyme chymopapain into the herniated disk produces a loss of water and proteoglycans from the disk, thereby reducing both the disk's size and the pressure in the nerve root. Special considerations Herniated disk requires supportive care, careful patient teaching, and strong emotional support to help the patient cope with the\\ndiscomfort and frustration of chronic low back pain. If the patient requires myelography, question him carefully about allergies to iodides, iodine-containing substances, or seafood because such allergies may indicate sensitivity to the test's radiopaque dye. Reinforce previous explanations of the need for this test, and tell the patient to expect some pain. Assure him\\nthat he'll receive a sedative before the test, if needed, to keep him as calm and comfortable as possible. After the test, urge the patient to\\nremain in bed with his head elevated (especially if metrizamide was used) and to drink plenty of fluids. Monitor intake and output. Watch for seizures and allergic reaction. P During conservative treatment, watch for any deterioration in neurologic status (especially during the first 24 hours after admission), which may indicate an urgent need for surgery. Use antiembolism stockings as prescribed, and encourage the patient to move his legs, as allowed. Provide high-topped sneakers to prevent footdrop. Work closely with the physical therapy department to ensure a consistent regimen of leg- and back-strengthening exercises. Give plenty\\nof fluids to prevent renal stasis, and remind the patient to cough, deep breathe, and use blow bottles or an incentive spirometer to preclude pulmonary complications. Provide good skin care. Assess for bowel and bladder functions. Use a fracture bedpan for the patient on complete bed rest. After laminectomy, microdiskectomy, or spinal fusion, enforce bed rest, as indicated. If a blood drainage system (Hemovac or Jackson Pratt drain) is in use, check the tubing frequently for kinks and a secure vacuum. Empty the Hemovac at the end of each shift, and record the amount and color of drainage. Report colorless moisture on dressings (possible cerebrospinal fluid leakage) or excessive drainage immediately. Observe neurovascular status of the legs (color, motion, temperature, and sensation). PREVENTION PREVENTING A HERNIATED DISK To prevent a herniated disk, tell your patient to follow these guidelines. Exercise Getting regular exercise can slow the degeneration of the disks related to aging. Muscle strength gained through exercising can strengthen and stabilize the spine. If the patient has previously had a herniated disk, he should remember to avoid high-impact activities such as jogging, tennis and high-impact aerobics for the first few months after a herniated disk. Maintain good posture Good posture reduces the pressure on the spine and disks.\\nKeeping the back straight and aligned is essential particularly when sitting for longer periods. Also heavy objects should be lifted properly\\nby using the legs \\u2014 not the back \\u2014 do most of the work. Maintain a healthy weight Excess weight puts more pressure on the spine and disks, making them more susceptible to a herniation. Monitor vital signs and check for bowel sounds and abdominal distention. Use logrolling technique to turn the patient. Administer analgesics as ordered, especially 30 minutes before initial attempts at sitting or walking. Give the patient assistance during his first attempt to walk. Provide a straight-backed chair for limited sitting. Teach the patient who has undergone spinal\\nfusion how to wear a brace. Assist with straight-leg-raising and toe-pointing exercises, as indicated. Before discharge, teach proper body mechanics \\u2014 bending at the knees and hips (never at the waist), standing straight, and carrying objects close to the body. Advise the patient to lie down when tired and to sleep on his side (never on his abdomen) on an extra-firm mattress or a bed board. Urge maintenance of proper weight to prevent lordosis caused by obesity. After chemonucleolysis, enforce bed rest as ordered. Administer analgesics and apply heat, as needed. Urge the patient to cough and deep breathe. Assist with physical therapy as necessary and advise the patient to continue these exercises after discharge. Tell the patient who must receive a muscle\\nrelaxant of possible adverse effects, especially drowsiness. Warn him to avoid activities that require alertness until he has built up a tolerance to the drug's sedative effects. Provide emotional support. Try to cheer the patient up during periods of frustration and depression. Assure him of his progress, and offer encouragement. (See Preventing a herniated disk. ) Scoliosis P Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine that may occur in the thoracic, lumbar, or thoracolumbar spinal segment. The curve may be convex to the right (more common in thoracic curves) or to the left (more common in lumbar curves). Rotation of the vertebral column around its axis occurs and may cause rib cage deformity. Scoliosis is commonly associated with kyphosis (roundback) and lordosis (swayback). Causes and incidence Scoliosis may be functional, structural, or idiopathic. Functional (postural) scoliosis usually results from a discrepancy in leg lengths rather than from a fixed deformity of the spinal column; it corrects when the patient bends toward the convex side. Structural scoliosis results from a deformity of the vertebral bodies, and it doesn't correct when the patient bends to the side. Structural scoliosis\\nmay be: congenital: usually related to a congenital defect, such as wedge vertebrae, fused ribs or vertebrae, or hemivertebrae; may result from trauma to zygote or\\nembryo paralytic or musculoskeletal: develops several months after asymmetrical paralysis of the trunk muscles due to polio, cerebral palsy, or muscular dystrophy idiopathic (the most common form): may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant or multifactorial trait. This form appears in a previously straight spine during the growing years. Brain stem dysfunction, possibly due to a lesion of the posterior\\ncolumns or the inner ear, may be the cause. PEDIATRIC TIP Idiopathic scoliosis can be classified as infantile, which affects mostly male infants between birth\\nand age 3 and causes left thoracic and right lumbar curves; juvenile, which affects both sexes between ages 4 and 10 and causes varying types of curvature; or adolescent, which generally affects girls between age 10 and achievement P of skeletal maturity and causes varying types of curvature. Complications Debilitating back pain Reduced pulmonary function Cor pulmonale Signs and symptoms The most common curve in functional or structural scoliosis arises in the thoracic segment, with convexity to the right, and compensatory curves (S curves) in the cervical segment above and the\\nlumbar segment below, both with convexity to the left. (See Cobb method for measuring angle of curvature. )\\nAs the spine curves laterally, compensatory curves develop to maintain body balance and mark the deformity. Scoliosis rarely produces subjective symptoms until it's well established; when symptoms do occur,\\nthey include backache, fatigue, and dyspnea. Because many teenagers are shy about their bodies, their parents suspect that something is wrong only after they notice uneven hemlines, pant legs that appear unequal in length, or subtle physical signs like one hip appearing higher than the other. Untreated scoliosis may result in pulmonary insufficiency (curvature may decrease lung capacity), back pain, degenerative arthritis of the spine, disk disease, and sciatica. COBB METHOD FOR MEASURING ANGLE OF CURVATURE The Cobb method measures the angle of curvature in scoliosis. The top vertebra in the curve (T6 in the illustration) is the\\nuppermost vertebra whose upper face tilts toward the curve's concave side. The bottom vertebra in the curve (T12) is the lowest vertebra whose lower face tilts toward the curve's concave side. The angle at which perpendicular lines drawn from the upper face of the top vertebra and the lower face of the bottom vertebra intersect is the angle of the curve. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Anterior, posterior, and lateral spinal X-rays, taken with the patient standing upright and bending, confirm scoliosis and determine the degree of curvature (Cobb method) and flexibility of the spine. A scoliometer can also be used to measure the angle of trunk rotation. Physical examination reveals unequal shoulder heights, elbow levels, and heights of the iliac crests. Muscles on the convex side of the curve may be rounded; those on the concave side, flattened, producing asymmetry of paraspinal muscles. Treatment Only two treatments effectively treat scoliosis: spinal bracing and surgery. If monitored closely, a properly constructed and fitted brace can successfully halt progression of a curve in approximately 70% of cooperative patients. Most braces should be worn over a long T-shirt or similar article of clothing for 23 hours a day. However, mild curvatures may require less. Exercises must be done daily both in and out of the brace to maintain muscle strength. Patients should be seen for follow-up and brace adjustment every 3 months. Radiographs should be repeated at 6-month intervals. As the skeleton matures, as seen radiographically, brace wear should be gradually decreased until it's worn only at night. The primary indications for surgery are relentless curve progression (usually curves over 40\\u00b0) or significant curve progression despite bracing. Surgery corrects lateral curvature by posterior spinal fusion and internal stabilization with metal rods. A distraction rod on the concave side of the curve \\u201cjacks\\u201d the spine into a straight position\\nand provides an internal splint. An alternative procedure, anterior spinal fusion, corrects curvature with vertebral staples and an anterior\\nstabilizing cable. Some spinal fusions may require postoperative immobilization in a brace. Postoperatively, periodic checkups are required for several months to monitor stability of the correction. Special considerations It's important to provide emotional support in addition to meticulous skin care and patient teaching. P If the patient needs a brace: Enlist the help of a physical therapist, a\\nsocial worker, and an orthotist. Before the patient goes home, explain what the brace does and how to care for it (how to check the screws for tightness and pad the uprights to prevent excessive wear on clothing). Suggest that loose-fitting, oversized clothes be worn for greater comfort. Tell the patient to wear the brace 23 hours per day and to remove it only for bathing and exercise. While he's\\nstill adjusting to the brace, tell him to lie down and rest several times per day. Suggest a soft mattress if a firm one is uncomfortable. To prevent skin breakdown, advise the patient not to use lotions, ointments, or powders on areas where the brace contacts the skin. Tell him to keep the skin dry and clean and to wear a snug T-shirt under the brace. Advise the patient to increase activities gradually and avoid vigorous sports. Emphasize the importance of conscientiously performing prescribed exercises. Instruct the patient to turn his whole body, instead of just his head, when looking to the side. To make reading easier, tell him to hold the book so he can look straight ahead at it instead of down. If he finds this difficult, help him to obtain prism glasses. If the patient needs traction or a cast before surgery: Explain these procedures to the patient and her family. Remember that application of a body cast can be traumatic because it's done on a special frame and the patient's head and face are covered throughout the procedure. Check the skin around the cast edge daily.\\nKeep the cast clean and dry and the edges of the cast petaled. Warn the\\npatient not to insert or let anything get under the cast and to immediately report cracks in the cast, pain, burning, skin breakdown, numbness, or odor. After corrective surgery: ALERT Check sensation, movement, color, and blood supply in all limbs every 2 to 4 hours for the first 48 hours and then several times a day, for signs of neurovascular deficit, a serious complication following spinal surgery. Logroll the patient often. Measure intake, output, and urine specific gravity to monitor effects of blood loss, which is usually substantial. Monitor abdominal distention and bowel sounds. Encourage deep-breathing exercises to avoid pulmonary complications. Medicate for pain, especially before any activity. Promote active range-of-motion arm exercises to help maintain muscle strength. Remember that any exercise, even brushing the hair or teeth, is helpful. Encourage the patient to perform quadriceps- setting, calfpumping, and active range-of-motion exercises of the ankles and feet. Watch for skin breakdown and signs of cast syndrome. Teach the patient how to recognize these signs. (See Cast syndrome. ) Offer emotional support to help prevent depression that may result from altered body image and immobility. Encourage the patient to wear her own clothes, wash her hair, and use makeup. If the patient is being discharged with a rod and cast and must have bed rest, arrange for a social worker and a visiting nurse to provide home care. Before discharge, check with the surgeon about activity limitations, and make sure the patient understands them. If you work in a school, screen children routinely for scoliosis during physical examinations. CAST SYNDROME Cast syndrome is a serious complication that sometimes follows spinal surgery and application of a body cast. Characterized by nausea, abdominal pressure, and vague abdominal pain, cast syndrome probably results from P hyperextension of the spine. This hyperextension accentuates lumbar lordosis, compressing the third portion of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery anteriorly and the aorta\\nand vertebral column posteriorly. High intestinal obstruction produces nausea, vomiting, and ischemic infarction of the mesentery. After removal of the cast, treatment includes gastric decompression and I.V. fluids, with nothing by mouth. Antiemetics should\\nbe given sparingly because they may mask symptoms of cast syndrome, which, if untreated, may be fatal. Teach patients who are discharged in body jackets, localizer casts, or high hip spica casts how to recognize cast syndrome,\\nwhich may manifest several weeks or months after application of the cast. MUSCLE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE Tendinitis and bursitis Tendinitis is a painful inflammation of tendons and of tendon-muscle attachments to bone, usually in the shoulder rotator cuff, hip, Achilles tendon, or hamstring. Bursitis is a painful inflammation of one or more of the bursae \\u2014 closed sacs lubricated with small amounts of synovial fluid that facilitate the motion of muscles and tendons over bony prominences. Bursitis usually occurs in the subdeltoid, olecranon, trochanteric, calcaneal, or prepatellar bursae. Causes and incidence Tendinitis commonly results from overuse or injury (such as strain during sports activity), another musculoskeletal disorder (such as rheumatic diseases or congenital defects), or aging. Bursitis can occur at any age but usually occurs in older\\nindividuals due to an inflammatory joint disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout) or recurring trauma that stresses or pressures a joint. Chronic bursitis follows attacks of acute bursitis or repeated trauma and infection. Septic bursitis may result from wound infection or\\nfrom bacterial invasion of skin over the bursa. Signs and symptoms The patient with tendinitis of the shoulder complains of restricted shoulder movement, especially abduction, and localized pain, which is most severe at night and usually interferes with sleep. The pain extends from the acromion (the shoulder's highest point) to the deltoid muscle insertion, predominantly in the so-called painful arc\\u2014that is, when the patient abducts his arm between 50 and 130 degrees. Fluid accumulation causes swelling. In calcific tendinitis, calcium deposits in the tendon cause proximal weakness and, if calcium erodes into adjacent bursae, acute calcific bursitis. In bursitis, fluid accumulation in the bursae causes irritation, inflammation, sudden or gradual pain, and limited movement. Other symptoms vary according to the affected site. Subdeltoid bursitis impairs arm abduction, prepatellar bursitis (housemaid's knee) produces pain when the patient climbs stairs, and hip bursitis makes crossing the\\nlegs painful. Diagnosis In tendinitis, X-rays may be normal at first but later show bony fragments, osteophyte sclerosis, or calcium deposits. Arthrography is usually normal, with occasional small irregularities on the undersurface of the tendon. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have replaced X-ray and even arthrography of the\\nshoulder as diagnostic tools. An MRI will usually identify tears, partial tears, inflammation, or tumor but cannot reveal irregularities of the tendon sheath itself. Diagnosis of tendinitis must rule out other\\ncauses of shoulder pain, such as myocardial infarction, cervical spondylosis, degenerative changes, and tendon tear or rupture. Significantly, in tendinitis, heat aggravates shoulder pain; in other painful joint disorders, heat usually provides relief. P Localized pain and inflammation and a history of unusual strain or injury 2 to 3 days before onset of pain are the bases for diagnosing bursitis. During early stages, X-rays are usually normal, except in calcific bursitis, where X-rays may show calcium deposits. Treatment Treatment to relieve pain includes resting the joint (by immobilization with a sling, splint, or cast), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, application of cold or heat, ultrasound, or local injection of an anesthetic and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. A mixture of a corticosteroid and an anesthetic such as lidocaine generally provides immediate pain relief. Extended-release injections of a corticosteroid, such as triamcinolone or prednisolone, offer longer-term pain relief. Until the patient is free of pain and able to perform range- of-motion exercises easily, treatment also includes oral NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, or oxaprozin. Short-term analgesics include propoxyphene, codeine, acetaminophen with codeine and, occasionally, oxycodone. Supplementary treatment includes fluid removal by aspiration and heat therapy; for calcific tendinitis, ice packs, physical therapy, ultrasonography, or hydrotherapy generally helps maintain or regain range of motion. It may be necessary to delay treatment until the acute attack is over to ensure maximum patient compliance. Rarely, calcific tendinitis requires surgical removal of calcium deposits. Long-term control of chronic bursitis and tendinitis may require changes in lifestyle to prevent recurring joint irritation. Special considerations When treating patients with tendinitis or bursitis, remember to consider the following: Assess the severity of pain and the range of motion to determine effectiveness of the treatment. Before injecting corticosteroids or local anesthetics, ask the patient about his drug allergies. Assist with intra-articular injection. Scrub the patient's skin thoroughly with povidone-iodine or a comparable\\nsolution. After the injection, massage the area to ensure penetration through the tissue and joint space. Apply ice intermittently for about 4\\nhours to minimize pain. Avoid applying heat to the area for 2 days. Tell the patient to take anti-inflammatory\\nagents with milk to minimize GI distress and to report any signs of distress immediately. Advise the patient to perform strengthening exercises and avoid activities that aggravate the joint. Remind the patient to wear a splint or sling during the first few days of an attack of subdeltoid bursitis or tendinitis to support the arm and protect the shoulder, particularly at night. Demonstrate how to wear the sling so it won't put too much weight\\non the shoulder. Advise the patient to maintain joint mobility and prevent muscle atrophy by performing exercises or physical therapy when he's free of pain. PEDIATRIC TIP A common form of tendinitis in adolescents (both males and females) is patellar tendinitis associated with inflammation of the tibial epiphysis in Osgood-Schlatter disease. Epicondylitis Lateral epicondylitis of the elbow (tennis elbow) is inflammation of the extensor tendons of the forearm. Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) is inflammation at the origin of the flexor muscles of the wrist. Causes and incidence Epicondylitis probably begins as a partial tear and is common among tennis players or persons whose activities require a forceful grasp, wrist extension against resistance, or frequent rotation\\nof the forearm such as using a screwdriver. Untreated epicondylitis may\\nbecome disabling as adherent fibers form between the tendons and the elbow capsule. P Complications Recurrence of injury Rupture of tendon Signs and symptoms The patient's initial symptom is elbow pain that gradually worsens and commonly radiates to the forearm and back of the hand whenever he grasps an object or twists his elbow. Other associated signs and symptoms include tenderness over the involved lateral or medial epicondyle or over the head of the radius and a weak grasp. In rare instances, epicondylitis may cause local heat, swelling, or restricted range of motion. Diagnosis Because X-rays are almost always negative, diagnosis typically depends on clinical signs and symptoms and a patient history of playing tennis or engaging in similar activities. The pain can be reproduced by wrist extension and supination with lateral involvement or\\nby flexion and pronation with medial epicondyle involvement. Treatment Treatment aims to relieve pain, usually by nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs or local injection of corticosteroids and an anesthetic. Supportive treatment includes an immobilizing splint from the distal forearm to the elbow, which generally relieves pain in 2 to 3 weeks; heat therapy, such as warm compresses, short-wave diathermy, and\\nultrasound (alone or in combination with diathermy); and physical therapy, such as manipulation and massage to detach the tendon from the chronically inflamed periosteum. A \\u201ctennis elbow strap\\u201d or counterface brace has helped many patients. This strap, which is wrapped snugly around the forearm approximately 1\\u2033 (2.5 cm) below the epicondyle, helps\\nrelieve the strain on affected forearm muscles and tendons. If these measures prove ineffective, surgical release of the tendon at the epicondyle may be necessary. Special considerations The following special considerations accompany diagnosis and treatment of epicondylitis: Assess the patient's level of pain, range of motion, and sensory function. Monitor heat therapy to prevent burns. Advise the patient to take anti-inflammatory drugs with food to avoid GI irritation. Instruct the patient to rest the elbow until inflammation subsides. Remove the support daily, and gently move the arm to prevent stiffness and contracture. Instruct the patient to follow the prescribed exercise program. For example, he may stretch his arm and flex his wrist to the maximum, then press the back of his hand against a\\nwall until he can feel a pull in his forearm, and hold this position for 1 minute. Advise the patient to warm up for 15 to 20 minutes before beginning any sports activity. Urge the patient to wear an elastic support or splint during any activity that stresses the forearm or elbow. Tell the patient to check his equipment. For example, a tennis racquet may not be the right size or weight. Also,\\nchanging surfaces may help to reduce stress. Achilles tendon contracture Achilles tendon contracture is a shortening of the Achilles tendon (tendo calcaneus or heel cord) that causes foot pain and strain and limits ankle dorsiflexion. Causes and incidence Achilles tendon contracture may reflect a congenital structural anomaly or a muscular reaction to chronic poor posture, especially in women who wear high-heeled shoes or joggers who land on the balls of their feet instead of their heels. Other causes include paralytic conditions of the legs, such as poliomyelitis or cerebral palsy. Complication Permanent weakness Signs and symptoms Sharp, spasmodic pain during dorsiflexion of the foot characterizes the reflex type of Achilles tendon contracture. In footdrop (fixed equinus), contracture of the flexor foot muscle prevents\\nplacing the heel on the ground. Diagnosis Physical examination and patient history suggest Achilles tendon contracture. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A simple test confirms Achilles tendon contracture: While the patient keeps his knee flexed, the examiner places the foot in dorsiflexion; gradual knee extension forces the foot into plantar flexion. Treatment Conservative treatment aims to correct Achilles tendon contracture by raising the inside heel of the shoe in the reflex type; by gradually lowering the heels of shoes (sudden lowering can aggravate the problem) and stretching exercises if the cause is high heels; or by using support braces or casting to prevent footdrop in a paralyzed patient. Alternative therapy includes using wedged plaster casts or stretching the tendon by manipulation. Analgesics may be given to relieve pain. With fixed footdrop, treatment may include surgery. Although this procedure may weaken the tendon, it allows further stretching by cutting the tendon. After surgery, a short leg cast maintains the foot in P 90-degree dorsiflexion for 6 weeks. Some surgeons allow partial weight bearing on a walking cast after 2 weeks. Special considerations After surgery to lengthen the Achilles tendon: Elevate the casted foot to decrease venous\\npressure and edema by raising the foot of the bed or supporting the foot with pillows. Record the neurovascular status of the toes (temperature, color, sensation, capillary refill time, and toe mobility) every hour for the first 24 hours and then every 4 hours. If any changes are detected, increase the elevation of the patient's legs and notify the surgeon immediately. Prepare the patient for ambulation by having him dangle his foot over the side of the bed for short periods (5\\nto 15 minutes) before he gets out of bed, allowing for gradual increase\\nof venous pressure. Assist the patient in walking, as ordered (usually within 24 hours of surgery), using crutches and a non-weight-bearing or touch-down gait. Protect the patient's skin with moleskin or by petaling the edges of the cast. Before discharge, teach the patient how to care for the cast, and advise him to elevate his foot regularly when sitting or whenever the foot throbs or becomes edematous.\\nAlso, make sure the patient understands how much exercise and walking are recommended after discharge. To prevent Achilles tendon contracture in paralyzed patients, apply support braces, universal splints, casts, or high-topped sneakers. Make sure the weight of the sheets doesn't keep paralyzed feet in plantar flexion. For other patients, teach good foot care and urge them to seek immediate medical care for foot problems. Warn women against wearing high heels constantly, and suggest regular foot (dorsiflexion) exercises. Carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome, a form of repetitive stress injury, is the most common of the nerve entrapment syndromes. It results\\nfrom P compression of the median nerve at the wrist, within the carpal tunnel. This compression neuropathy causes sensory and motor changes in the median distribution of the hand. Causes and incidence The carpal tunnel is formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. (See The carpal tunnel. ) Inflammation or fibrosis of the tendon sheaths that pass through the carpal tunnel commonly causes edema and compression of the median nerve. Many conditions can cause the contents or structure of the\\ncarpal tunnel to swell and press the median nerve against the transverse carpal ligament. Such conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, flexor tenosynovitis (commonly associated with rheumatic disease), nerve compression, pregnancy, renal failure, menopause, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, edema following Colles' fracture, hypothyroidism, amyloidosis, myxedema, benign tumors, tuberculosis, and other granulomatous diseases. Another source of damage to the median nerve is dislocation or acute sprain of the wrist. THE CARPAL TUNNEL The carpal tunnel is clearly visible in this palmar view and cross section of a right hand. Note the median nerve, flexor tendons\\nof fingers, and blood vessels passing through the tunnel on their way from the forearm to the hand. PREVENTION PREVENTING CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME To prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, advise your patients to make these lifestyle changes. Take frequent breaks Gently stretching and bending the hands and wrists every 15 to 20 minutes gives the hands and wrists a break, especially when using equipment that vibrates or exerts a great amount of force. Tasks should also be alternated to avoid repetitive movements, which can contribute to tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Watch hand and wrist positioning When using a keyboard, bending the wrist all the way up or down should be avoided. A relaxed middle position is best. The keyboard should be kept at elbow height or slightly lower. Improve posture Poor posture can cause the shoulders to roll forward, allowing the neck and shoulder muscles to shorten which can compress the\\nnerves in the neck. This position can affect the wrists, hands, and fingers. Keep hands warm Hand stiffness and pain develops more frequently in a cold environment. Using fingerless gloves may help if the temperature can't be adjusted at work. Carpal tunnel injury is five times more common in women than in men. It usually occurs in women between ages 30 and 60 and poses\\na serious occupational health problem. Assembly-line workers and packers and people who repeatedly use poorly designed tools are most likely to develop this disorder. Any strenuous use of the hands \\u2014 sustained grasping, twisting, or flexing \\u2014 aggravates this condition. (See Preventing carpal tunnel syndrome. ) Complications P Decreased wrist function Permanent nerve damage Loss of movement and sensation Signs and symptoms The patient with carpal tunnel syndrome usually complains\\nof weakness, pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in one or both hands.\\nThis paresthesia affects the thumb, forefinger, middle finger, and half\\nof the fourth finger. The patient is unable to clench his hand into a fist; the nails may be atrophic, the skin dry and shiny. Because of vasodilatation and venous stasis, symptoms are\\ntypically worse at night and in the morning. The pain may spread to the\\nforearm and, in severe cases, as far as the shoulder or neck. The patient can usually relieve such pain by shaking or rubbing his hands vigorously or dangling his arms at his side. Diagnosis Physical examination reveals decreased sensation to light\\ntouch or pinpricks in the affected fingers. Thenar muscle atrophy occurs in about half of all cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it's usually a late sign. The patient exhibits a positive Tinel's sign (tingling over the median nerve on light percussion) and responds positively to Phalen's wrist- flexion test (holding the forearms vertically and allowing both hands to drop into complete flexion at the wrists for 1 minute reproduces symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome). A compression test supports this diagnosis: A blood pressure cuff inflated\\nabove systolic pressure on the forearm for 1 to 2 minutes provokes pain\\nand paresthesia along the distribution of the median nerve. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity detect a median nerve motor conduction delay of more than 5 milliseconds. Other laboratory tests may identify the underlying disease. Treatment Conservative treatment should be tried first, including resting the hands by splinting the wrist in neutral extension for 1 to 2\\nweeks. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs usually provide symptomatic\\nrelief. Injection of the carpal tunnel with hydrocortisone and lidocaine may provide significant but temporary relief. If a definite link has been established between the patient's occupation and the development of repetitive stress injury, he may have to seek other work.\\nEffective treatment may also require correction of an underlying disorder. When conservative treatment fails, the only alternative is surgical decompression of the nerve by resecting the entire transverse carpal tunnel ligament or by using endoscopic surgical techniques. Neurolysis (freeing of the nerve fibers) may also be necessary. Special considerations Patient care for carpal tunnel syndrome includes the following: Administer mild analgesics as needed. Encourage the patient to use his hands as much as possible. If his dominant hand has been impaired, you may have to help with eating and bathing. Teach the patient how to apply a splint. Tell him not to make it too tight. Show him how to remove the splint to perform gentle range-of- motion exercises, which should be done daily. Make sure the patient knows how to do these exercises before he's discharged. After surgery, monitor vital signs, and regularly check the color, sensation, and motion of the affected hand. Advise the patient who's about to be discharged to occasionally exercise his hands in warm water. If the arm is in a sling, tell him to remove the sling several times a day to do exercises for his elbow and shoulder. Suggest occupational counseling for the patient who has to change jobs because of repetitive stress injury. Torticollis Torticollis, sometimes called wryneck, is a neck deformity in which the sternocleidomastoid neck muscles are spastic or shortened, causing P bending of the head to the affected side and rotation of the chin to the opposite side. Causes and incidence Torticollis may be congenital or acquired. The three types of acquired torticollis\\u2014 acute, spasmodic, and hysterical\\u2014have differing causes. The acute form results from muscular damage caused by inflammatory diseases, such as myositis, lymphadenitis, or tuberculosis (TB); from cervical spinal injuries that produce scar tissue contracture; and, less commonly, from tumor or medication. The spasmodic\\nform results from rhythmic muscle spasms caused by an organic central nervous system disorder (probably due to irritation of the nerve root by\\narthritis or osteomyelitis). Hysterical torticollis is due to a psychogenic inability to control neck muscles. Acquired torticollis usually develops during the first 10\\nyears of life or between ages 30 and 60. Incidence of congenital (muscular) torticollis is highest in infants after difficult delivery (breech presentation), in firstborn infants, and in girls. Possible causes of congenital torticollis include malposition of the head in utero, prenatal injury, fibroma, interruption of blood supply, or fibrotic rupture of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with hematoma and scar formation. RECOGNIZING TORTICOLLIS In torticollis, contraction of the sternocleidomastoid neck muscles produces a twisting of the neck and an unnatural position of the head. Complication Permanent contracture Signs and symptoms PEDIATRIC TIP The first sign of congenital torticollis is commonly a firm, nontender, palpable enlargement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that's visible at birth and for several weeks\\nafterward. It slowly regresses during a period of 6 months, although incomplete regression can cause permanent contracture. If the deformity is severe, the infant's face and head flatten from sleeping on the affected side; this asymmetry gradually worsens. The infant's chin turns\\naway from the side of the shortened muscle, and his head tilts to the shortened side. His shoulder may elevate on the affected side, restricting neck movement. The first sign of acquired torticollis is usually recurring unilateral stiffness of neck muscles followed by a drawing sensation and a momentary twitching or contraction that pulls the head to the affected P side. This type of torticollis commonly produces severe neuralgic pain throughout the head and neck. (See Recognizing torticollis. ) Diagnosis A history of painless neck deformity from birth suggests congenital torticollis; gradual onset of painful neck deformity suggests\\nacquired torticollis. Diagnosis must rule out TB of the cervical spine,\\npharyngeal or tonsillar inflammations, spinal accessory nerve damage, ruptured transverse ligaments, subdural hematoma, tumors of soft tissue or bone, dislocations and fractures, scoliosis, congenital abnormalities\\nof the cervical spine and base of the skull, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteomyelitis. In acquired torticollis, cervical spine X-rays are negative for bone or joint disease but may reveal an associated disorder\\n(such as TB, scar tissue formation, tumor, deformities, or arthritis). Computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging may help rule out pathogenic causes. Treatment Treatment of congenital torticollis aims to stretch the shortened muscle. Nonsurgical treatment includes passive neck stretching\\nand proper positioning during sleep for an infant and active stretching\\nexercises for an older child \\u2014 for example, touching the ear opposite the affected side to the shoulder and touching the chin to the same shoulder. Surgical correction involves sectioning the sternocleidomastoid muscle; this should be done during preschool years and only if other therapies fail. Treatment of acquired torticollis aims to control pain and correct the underlying cause of the disease. In the acute form, application of heat, cervical traction, and gentle massage may help relieve pain; analgesics may also be helpful. Stretching exercises and a\\nneck brace may relieve symptoms of the spasmodic and hysterical forms. Drug treatment includes anticholinergic drugs such as baclofen. Botulinum toxin injections are effective in temporarily relieving torticollis, but injections must be repeated every 3 months. Special considerations Patient care for torticollis includes the following: To aid early diagnosis of congenital torticollis, observe the infant for limited neck movement, and thoroughly assess his degree of discomfort. Teach the parents of an affected child how\\nto perform stretching exercises with him. Suggest placing toys or mobiles on the side of the crib opposite the affected side of the child's neck to encourage the child to move his head and stretch his neck. If surgery is necessary, prepare the patient by shaving the neck to the hairline on the affected side. After corrective surgery: Monitor the patient closely for nausea or signs of respiratory complications, especially if he's in cervical traction. Keep suction equipment available to prevent aspiration. The patient may be in a cast or in traction day and night or at night only. Monitor the skin around the chin, ears, and back of the head if the patient is in cervical traction.\\nMonitor for problems related to clenching of teeth. If the patient is in a cast, give meticulous cast care, including the monitoring of circulation, sensation, and color around the cast. Protect the cast around the patient's chin and mouth with waterproof material. Check for skin irritation, pressure areas, or softening of cast pad. Provide emotional support for the patient and his family to relieve their anxiety due to fear, pain, limitations from the brace or traction, and an altered body image. Begin stretching exercises as soon as the patient can tolerate them. Before discharge, explain to the patient or his parents the importance of continuing daily heat applications, massages, and stretching exercises, as prescribed, and of keeping the cast clean and dry. Emphasize that physical therapy is essential for a successful rehabilitation after the cast is removed. P Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle fibers that results in the release of muscle fiber content into the circulation. It results from the toxicity of destroyed muscle cells, causing kidney damage or failure. Predisposing factors include trauma, ischemia, polymyositis, and drug overdose. Toxins and environmental, infectious, and metabolic factors may induce it. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 8% to 15% of cases of acute renal failure; about 5% of cases result in death. Causes and incidence Rhabdomyolysis follows direct injury to the skeletal muscle fibers, specifically the sarcolemma, which then release myoglobin\\ninto the bloodstream. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein pigment found in skeletal muscle. When this muscle is damaged, myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It's then filtered by the kidneys. Myoglobin may occlude the structures of the kidney causing damage, such as acute tubular necrosis or kidney failure. Myoglobin can also cause kidney failure because it breaks down into potentially toxic compounds. Necrotic skeletal muscle may cause massive fluid shifts from the bloodstream into the muscle, reducing the relative\\nfluid volume of the body and leading to shock and reduced blood flow to\\nthe kidneys. The disorder may be caused by any condition that results in damage to skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyolysis may result from blunt trauma; extensive burn injury; viral, bacterial, or fungal infection (such as legionnaire's disease or, especially, influenza type A or B); prolonged immobilization; near electrocution or near drowning; metabolic\\nor genetic factors; drug therapy; or toxins. Heavy exercise in children\\nmay result in rhabdomyolysis. Other causes include shaken baby syndrome, exposure to extreme cold, heatstroke, and snakebite. In the United States, rhabdomyolysis affects about 8% to 15% of people with acute renal failure and has a slightly higher incidence in men than in women. The overall mortality rate is 5%. It can\\noccur in infants, toddlers, and adolescents who inherited enzyme deficiencies of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism or those with inherited myopathies, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and malignant hyperthermia. Complications Acute tubular necrosis Kidney failure Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include myalgias or muscle pain (especially in the thighs, calves, or lower back), weakness,\\ntenderness, malaise, fever, dark urine, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may also experience weight gain, seizures, joint pain, and fatigue. Symptoms may be subtle initially. Rhabdomyolysis can result in acute renal failure. Diagnosis A serum or urine myoglobin test is positive. Creatine kinase levels 100 times above normal or higher suggest rhabdomyolysis. A\\nurinalysis may reveal casts and may be positive for hemoglobin without evidence of red blood cells on microscopic examination. Serum potassium may be very high (potassium is released from cells into the bloodstream when cell breakdown occurs). Treatment Early, aggressive hydration may prevent complications from rhabdomyolysis by rapidly eliminating the myoglobin from the kidneys. I.V. hydration and diuretics promote diuresis. Diuretic medications, such as mannitol or furosemide, may aid in flushing the pigment out of the kidneys. If urine output is sufficient, bicarbonate may be given to maintain an alkaline urine state, thereby helping to prevent the dissociation of myoglobin into toxic compounds. Hyperkalemia\\nshould be treated if present. Kidney failure should be treated as appropriate. Dialysis may be necessary and, in severe cases, kidney transplantation. Special considerations Monitor the patient's intake and output, vital signs, electrolyte levels, daily weight, and laboratory results. ALERT Watch for signs of renal failure (such as decreasing urine output and increasing urine specific gravity),\\nfluid overload (such as dyspnea and tachycardia), pulmonary edema, and electrolyte imbalances (such as serum potassium). Provide reassurance and emotional support for the patient and his family. To help prevent rhabdomyolysis from occurring, ensure adequate hydration, monitor the patient for adverse reactions to any of his prescribed drugs, and monitor blood transfusion administration carefully.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEYS The major components of the kidneys are depicted below. Introduction The kidneys are located retroperitoneally in the lumbar area, with the right kidney a little lower than the left because of the liver mass above P it. The left kidney is slightly longer than the right and closer to the midline. The kidneys move as body position changes. They're covered by the fibrous capsule, perirenal fat, renal fascia, and\\npararenal fat. (See Structure of the kidneys .) Renal arteries branch into five segmental arteries that supply different areas of the kidneys. The segmental arteries then branch into several divisions from which the afferent arterioles and vasa recta arise. Renal veins follow a similar branching pattern, characterized by stellate vessels and segmental branches, and empty into\\nthe inferior vena cava. The tubular system receives its blood supply from a peritubular capillary network of vessels. The gross structure of each kidney includes the lateral and medial margins, the hilus, the renal sinus, and renal parenchyma. The hilus, located at the medial margin, is the indentation where the blood and lymph vessels enter the kidney and the ureter emerges. The hilus leads to the renal sinus, which is a spacious cavity filled with adipose tissue, branches of the renal vessels, calyces, the renal pelvis, and the ureter. The renal sinus is surrounded by parenchyma, which consists of a cortex and a medulla. The cortex (outermost layer of the kidney) contains glomeruli (parts of the nephron), cortical arches (areas that separate the medullary pyramids from the renal surface), columns of Bertin (areas\\nthat separate the pyramids from one another), and medullary rays of Ferrein (long, delicate processes from the bases of the pyramids that mix with the cortex). The medulla contains pyramids (cone-shaped structures of parenchymal tissue), papillae (apical ends of the pyramids\\nthrough which urine oozes into the minor calyces), and papillary ducts of Bellini (collecting ducts in the pyramids that empty into the papillae). Ureters The ureters are a pair of retroperitoneally located, mucosa-lined, fibromuscular tubes that transport urine from the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder. Although the ureters have no sphincters, their oblique entrance into the bladder creates a mucosal fold that may produce a sphincterlike action. The adult urinary bladder is a spherical, hollow muscular\\nsac, with a normal capacity of 300 to 600 ml. It's located anterior and\\ninferior to the peritoneal cavity, and posterior to the pubic bones. The gross structure of the bladder includes the fundus (large central, posterosuperior portion of the bladder), the apex (anterosuperior region), the body (posteroinferior region containing the ureteral orifices), and the urethral orifice, or neck (most inferior portion of the bladder). The three orifices comprise a triangular area called the trigone . Nephrons The functional units of each kidney are its 1 to 3 million nephrons. Each nephron is composed of the renal corpuscle and the tubular system. The renal corpuscle includes the glomerulus (a network of minute blood vessels) and Bowman's capsule (an epithelial sac\\nsurrounding the glomerulus that's part of the tubular system). The renal corpuscle has a vascular pole, where the afferent arteriole enters\\nand the efferent arteriole emerges, and a urinary pole that narrows to form the beginning of the tubular system. The tubular system includes the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. The last portion of the nephron consists of the collecting duct. Innervation and vasculature The kidneys are innervated by sympathetic branches from the celiac plexus, upper lumbar splanchnic and thoracic nerves, and the intermesenteric and superior hypogastric plexuses, which form a plexus around the kidneys. Similar numbers of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves from the renal plexus, superior hypogastric plexus, and intermesenteric plexus innervate the ureters. Nerves that arise from the\\ninferior hypogastric plexuses innervate the bladder. The parasympathetic nerve supply to the bladder controls micturition. The ureters receive their blood supply from the renal, vesical, gonadal, and iliac arteries, and the abdominal aorta. The ureteral veins follow the arteries and drain into the renal vein. The bladder receives blood through vesical arteries. Vesical veins unite to form the pudendal plexus, which empties into the iliac veins. A rich lymphatic system drains the renal cortex, the kidneys, the ureters, and the bladder. P Homeostasis Through the production and elimination of urine, the kidneys maintain homeostasis. These vital organs regulate the volume, electrolyte concentration, and acid-base balance of body fluids; detoxify the blood and eliminate wastes; regulate blood pressure; and aid in erythropoiesis. The kidneys eliminate wastes from the body through urine formation (by glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption,\\nand tubular secretion) and excretion. Glomerular filtration, the process of filtering the blood flowing through the kidneys, depends on the permeability of the capillary walls, vascular pressure, and filtration pressure. The normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is about 120 ml/minute. Clearance measures function Clearance is the volume of plasma that can be cleared of a\\ngiven substance per unit of time, and depends on how renal tubular cells handle the substance that has been filtered by the glomerulus: If the tubules don't reabsorb or secrete the substance, clearance equals the GFR. If the tubules reabsorb it, clearance is less than the GFR. If the tubules secrete it, clearance is greater than the GFR. If the tubules reabsorb and secrete it, clearance is less than, equal to, or greater than the GFR. The most accurate measure of glomerular function is creatinine clearance, because this substance is filtered only by the glomerulus and isn't reabsorbed by the tubules. The transport of filtered substances in tubular reabsorption or secretion may be active (requiring the expenditure of energy) or passive (requiring none). For example, energy is required to move sodium across tubular cells (active transport), but none is required to move urea (passive transport). The amount of reabsorption or secretion of a substance depends on the maximum tubular transport capacity for that substance; that is, the greatest amount of a substance that can be reabsorbed or secreted per minute without saturating the system. ELDER TIP After age 40, a person's renal function begins to diminish; if he lives to age 90, it may have decreased by as much as 50%. This change is reflected in a decreased GFR; it's caused by age-related changes in the renal vasculature that disturb glomerular hemodynamics as well as by reduced cardiac output and\\natherosclerotic changes that reduce renal blood flow by more than 50%. Water regulation Hormones partially control water regulation by the kidneys. Hormonal control depends on the response of osmoreceptors to changes in osmolality. The two hormones involved are antidiuretic hormone (ADH), produced by the pituitary gland, and aldosterone, produced by the adrenal cortex. ADH alters the collecting tubules' permeability to water. When plasma concentration of ADH is high, the tubules are very permeable to water, so a greater amount of water is reabsorbed, creating a high concentration but small volume of urine. The\\nreverse is true if ADH concentration is low. Aldosterone regulates sodium and water reabsorption from the distal tubules. High plasma aldosterone concentration promotes sodium and water reabsorption from the tubules and decreases sodium and water excretion in the urine; low plasma aldosterone concentration promotes sodium and water excretion. Aldosterone also helps control the distal tubular secretion of potassium. Other factors that determine potassium secretion include the amount of potassium ingested, number of hydrogen ions secreted, level of intracellular potassium, amount of sodium in the distal tubule, and the GFR. The countercurrent mechanism \\u2014 composed of a multiplication system and an exchange system that occur in the renal medulla via the limbs of the loop of Henle and the vasa recta\\u2014is the method by which the kidneys concentrate urine. It achieves active transport of sodium and chloride between the loop of Henle and the medullary interstitial fluid. Failure of the countercurrent mechanism produces polyuria and nocturia. P To regulate acid-base balance, the kidneys secrete hydrogen ions, reabsorb sodium and bicarbonate ions, acidify phosphate salts, and synthesize ammonia\\u2014 which keep the blood at its normal pH of 7.37 to 7.43. The kidneys assist in regulating blood pressure by synthesizing and secreting renin in response to an actual, or perceived,\\ndecrease in the volume of extracellular fluid. Renin, in turn, acts on a\\nsubstrate to form angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases arterial blood pressure by peripheral vasoconstriction and stimulation of aldosterone secretion. The resulting\\nincrease in the aldosterone level promotes the reabsorption of sodium and water to correct the fluid deficit and renal ischemia. The kidneys secrete erythropoietin in response to decreased oxygen tension in the renal blood supply. Erythropoietin then acts on the bone marrow to increase the production of red blood cells (RBCs). Renal tubular cells synthesize active vitamin D and help regulate calcium balance and bone metabolism. Clinical assessment Assessment of the renal and urologic systems begins with an accurate patient history and requires a thorough physical examination\\nand certain laboratory data and test results from invasive and noninvasive procedures. When obtaining a patient history, ask about symptoms that pertain specifically to the pathology of the renal and urologic systems, such as frequency or urgency, and about the presence of any systemic diseases that can produce renal or urologic dysfunction,\\nsuch as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or bladder infections. Family history may also suggest a genetic predisposition to certain renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis or polycystic kidney disease. Also,\\nask what medications the patient has been taking; abuse of analgesics or antibiotics may cause nephrotoxicity. Physical examination for renal disease The first step in physical examination is careful observation of the patient's overall appearance, because renal disease affects all body systems. Examine the patient's skin for color, turgor, intactness, and texture; mucous membranes for color, secretions, odor, and intactness; eyes for periorbital edema and vision; general activity for motion, gait, and posture; muscle movement for motor function and general strength; and mental status for level of consciousness, orientation, and response to stimuli. (See Common renal symptoms .) Renal disease causes distinctive changes in vital signs: hypertension due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances and hyperactivity of the renin- angiotensin system; a strong, fast, irregular pulse due to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; hyperventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis; and an increased susceptibility to infection due to overall decreased resistance. Palpation and percussion may reveal little\\nbecause the kidneys and bladder are difficult to palpate unless they are enlarged or distended. Noninvasive tests and monitoring Laboratory tests analyze serum levels of chemical substances such as uric acid, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen; tests\\nalso determine urine characteristics, including the presence of RBCs, white blood cells, casts, or bacteria; specific gravity and pH; and physical properties, such as clarity, color, and odor. (See Serum and urine values in renal disease, pages 376 and 377.) Intake and output assessment: Fluid intake\\nand output measurement helps determine the patient's hydration status but isn't a reliable method of evaluating renal function because urine output varies with different types of renal disorders. To provide the most useful and accurate information, use calibrated containers, establish baseline values for each patient, compare measurement patterns, and validate intake and output measurements by checking the patient's weight daily. Monitor all fluid losses\\u2014including blood, vomitus, and diarrhea. Also assess wound and stoma drainage daily. COMMON RENAL SYMPTOMS Symptom Possible cause P Dribbling Prostatic enlargement, strictures Dysuria Infection, inflammation of bladder or urethra Edema Nephrotic syndrome, failure Frequency Infection, diabetes, bladder tumors, medications Hematuria Glomerular diseases, trauma, neoplasms, renal calculi Hesitancy Neurogenic bladder, infection Incontinence Infection, neoplasms, prolapsed uterus Nocturia Infection, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes, medications Oliguria Failure, insufficiency, neoplasms Proteinuria Glomerular diseases, infection Pyuria Infection Renal colic Calculi Urgency Infection, prostatic disease, medications Specimen collection: Meticulous specimen collection is vital for valid laboratory data. If the patient is collecting the specimen, explain the importance of cleaning the meatal area thoroughly. The culture specimen should be caught midstream, in a sterile container; a specimen for urinalysis, in a clean container, preferably at the first voiding of the day. Begin a 24-hour specimen collection after discarding\\nthe first voiding; such specimens often necessitate special handling or\\npreservatives. When obtaining a urine specimen from a catheterized patient, remember to avoid taking the specimen from the collection bag; instead, aspirate a sample through the collection port in the catheter, with a sterile needle and a syringe. Kidney-ureter-bladder radiography: This test assesses size, shape, position, and areas of calcification of these organs. Ultrasonography: This safe, painless procedure allows for visualization of the renal parenchyma, calyces, pelvis, ureters, and bladder. Because the test doesn't depend on renal function, it's useful in patients with renal failure and in detecting complications after kidney transplantation. Invasive tests: See Invasive diagnostic tests for assessing the renal and urologic systems , pages 378 and 379.

Urinary diversion is the surgical creation of an outlet\\nfor excreting urine. The types of urinary diversion include ileal conduit, cutaneous ureterostomy, ureterosigmoidostomy, and creation of a\\nrectal bladder. In dialysis, a semipermeable membrane, osmosis, and diffusion imitate normal renal function by eliminating excess body fluids, maintaining or restoring plasma electrolyte and acid-base balance, and removing waste products and dialyzable poisons from the blood. Dialysis is most often used for patients with acute or chronic renal failure. The two most common types of dialysis are peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR ASSESSING THE RENAL AND UROLOGIC SYSTEMS Several invasive tests are available to assist in diagnosis of renal and urologic problems. The most serious complication which occurs with many of these procedures is hypersensitivity to the contrast media. Symptoms may include increased pulse rate, itching, hives, chills, fever, dyspnea, and shock. Procedure Purpose Special considerations Computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Although\\nCT scan and MRI can be noninvasive, I.V. contrast material is often given to enhance the views obtained. These tests are especially helpful in evaluating renal or bladder mass lesions. After: After using I.V. contrast medium, observe for hypersensitivity reaction and hematoma at injection site. Cystoscopy A fiber-optic scope is used to visualize the inside of the bladder in cystoscopy. Before: Give sedatives as ordered. After: Offer increased fluids; administer analgesics; watch for hematuria and signs of perforation, hemorrhage, and infection (chills, fever, increased pulse rate, shock). Cystourethrography In cystourethrography, X-rays and I.V. contrast material are used to determine size and shape of the bladder and urethra. During: Catheterize the patient. After: Offer increased fluids; observe for hypersensitivity reaction. Cystometry Cystometry\\nis used to evaluate bladder pressure, sensation, and capacity. A catheter is introduced into the bladder, and saline solution is instilled. Results are shown on a computer at the time of testing. Before: Observe voiding; catheterize for residual urine. After: Remove catheter; watch for stress incontinence when patient coughs; watch voiding; catheterize for residual urine. Excretory urography Excretory\\nurography uses X- rays and I.V. contrast material to allow visualization\\nof renal parenchyma, calyces, pelves, ureters, and bladder. After: Observe for hypersensitivity reaction; watch for hematomas at injection site. Nephrotomography In nephrotomography, I.V. contrast material and tomography are used to visualize parenchymia, calyces, and pelves in layers. After: Observe for hypersensitivity reaction. Renal angiography Renal\\nangiography uses contrast material injected into a catheter in the femoral artery or vein to allow visualization of the arterial tree and capillaries as well as venous drainage of the kidney. After: Observe for hypersensitivity reaction, hematomas and hemorrhage at injection site, and nephrotoxicity. Offer increased fluids. Renal scan In renal scan, radioisotopes After: Observe for hypersensitivity P P are administered I.V., and images of the kidney are taken at intervals to determine renal function. reaction. Renal biopsy The specimen obtained in renal biopsy is used to develop histologic diagnosis and determine therapy and prognosis. Before: Make sure the patient's clotting times, prothrombin times, and platelet count are recorded on his chart. After: Apply gentle pressure to the bandage site. Watch for hemorrhage and hematoma at the biopsy site and look for hematuria. In peritoneal dialysis, a dialysate solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity. Substances then diffuse through the peritoneal membrane. Waste products remain in the dialysate solution and\\nare removed. Hemodialysis separates solutes by differential diffusion through a cellophane membrane placed between the blood and the dialysate solution, in an external receptacle. Because the blood must actually pass out of the body into a dialysis machine, hemodialysis requires an access route to the blood supply by an arteriovenous fistula or cannula or by a bovine or synthetic graft. When caring for a patient with such an access route, monitor the patency of the access route, prevent infection, and promote safety and adequate function. After dialysis, watch for such complications as headache, vomiting, agitation, and twitching. Patients with end-stage renal disease may benefit from kidney transplantation, despite its limitations: a shortage of donor kidneys, the chance of transplant rejection, and the need for lifelong medications and follow-up care. After kidney transplantation, maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, prevent infection, monitor for rejection,\\nand promote psychological well-being. CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Medullary sponge kidney In medullary sponge kidney, the collecting ducts in the renal pyramids dilate, and cavities, clefts, and cysts form in the medulla. This disease may affect only a single pyramid in one kidney or all pyramids in both kidneys. The kidneys are usually somewhat enlarged but may be of normal size; they appear spongy. Because this disorder is usually asymptomatic and benign,\\nit's often overlooked until the patient reaches adulthood. The prognosis is generally very good. Medullary sponge kidney is unrelated to medullary cystic disease; these conditions are similar only in the presence and location of the cysts. Causes and incidence Medullary sponge kidney may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, but this remains unproven. Most nephrologists consider it a congenital abnormality. Although medullary sponge kidney may be found in both sexes and in all agegroups, it primarily affects males ages 40 to 70. It\\noccurs in about 1 in every 5,000 to 20,000 persons. Complications Calcium oxalate calculi Infection Signs and symptoms Symptoms usually appear only as a result of complications\\nand are seldom present before adulthood. Complications include formation of calcium oxylate stones, which lodge in the dilated cystic collecting ducts or pass through a ureter, and infection secondary to dilation of the ducts. These complications, which occur in about 30% of patients, are likely to produce severe colic, hematuria, lower urinary tract infection ([UTI]; burning on urination, urgency, frequency), and pyelonephritis. Secondary impairment of renal function from obstruction and infection occurs in only about 10% of patients. Diagnosis Excretory urography is usually the key to diagnosis, often showing a characteristic flowerlike appearance of the pyramidal cavities when they fill with contrast material. It may also show renal calculi. Urinalysis is generally normal unless complications develop; however, it may show a slight reduction in concentrating ability or hypercalciuria. Diagnosis must distinguish medullary sponge kidney from renal tuberculosis, renal tubular acidosis, and papillary necrosis. Treatment Treatment focuses on preventing or treating complications\\ncaused by stones and infection. Specific measures include increasing fluid intake and monitoring renal function and urine. New symptoms necessitate immediate evaluation. Because medullary sponge kidney is a benign condition, surgery is seldom necessary, except to remove stones during acute obstruction. Only serious, uncontrollable infection or hemorrhage requires nephrectomy. Special considerations Patient care includes explaining the disease to the patient and his family and reassuring them that the condition is benign and the prognosis good. To prevent infection, instruct the patient\\nto bathe often and use proper toilet hygiene; this is especially important for a female patient because the proximity of the urinary meatus and the anus increases the risk of infection. If infection occurs, stress the importance of completing the prescribed course of antibiotic therapy. Emphasize the need for adequate fluid intake. Explain all diagnostic procedures, and provide emotional support. Teach the patient how to collect a clean-catch urine specimen for P culture. Check for allergy to excretory urography dye. When the patient is hospitalized for a stone, strain all urine, administer analgesics as ordered, and force fluids. Before discharge, tell the patient to watch for and report any signs of stone passage and UTI. Polycystic kidney disease Polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disorder characterized by multiple, bilateral, grapelike clusters of fluid-filled\\ncysts that grossly enlarge the kidneys, compressing and eventually replacing functioning renal tissue. (See Polycystic kidney. )\\nThe disease appears in two distinct forms: The infantile form typically\\ncauses stillbirth or early neonatal death, although some infants may survive for 2 years, then develop fatal renal, cardiac, or respiratory failure. The adult form begins insidiously but usually becomes obvious between ages 30 and 50; rarely, it causes no symptoms until the patient is in his 70s. In the adult form, renal deterioration is more gradual but, as in the infantile form, progresses relentlessly to fatal uremia. The prognosis in adults is extremely variable. Progression may be slow, even after symptoms of renal insufficiency appear. However, after uremic symptoms develop, polycystic kidney disease is usually fatal within 4 years, unless the patient receives treatment with dialysis, kidney transplantation, or both. Causes and incidence While both types of polycystic kidney disease are genetically transmitted, the incidence in two distinct age groups and different inheritance patterns suggest two unrelated disorders. The infantile type appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, whereas the adult type seems to be an autosomal dominant trait. The gene\\nhas been located on chromosome 6, supporting the premise that this is a\\nsingle genetic disease with variable phenotype presentation. Polycystic kidney disease reportedly affects 1 in every 1,000 Americans; yet that number may be even higher because some cases from patients who aren't symptomatic go unreported. Both types of polycystic kidney disease affect males and females equally. POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY In polycystic kidney disease, cysts are seen in grapelike clusters, as shown below. Complications Hypertension Urinary tract infection (UTI) Kidney infection End-stage kidney disease Kidney stones Ruptured cysts Signs and symptoms PEDIATRIC TIP P The neonate with infantile polycystic disease often has pronounced epicanthal folds, a pointed nose, a small chin, and floppy, lowset ears (Potter facies). At birth, he has huge bilateral masses on the flanks that are symmetrical, tense, and can't be transilluminated. He characteristically shows signs of respiratory distress and heart failure. Eventually, he develops uremia and renal failure. Accompanying hepatic fibrosis may cause portal hypertension and bleeding varices to develop, requiring sclerotherapy or\\nportacaval shunting. Adult polycystic kidney disease is commonly asymptomatic through the patient's 40s, but may induce nonspecific symptoms, such as hypertension, polyuria, and recurrent UTIs. Later, the patient develops overt symptoms related to the enlarging kidney mass, such as lumbar pain, widening girth, and swollen or tender abdomen. Abdominal pain is usually worsened by exertion and relieved by lying down. In advanced stages, this disease may cause recurrent hematuria, life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding\\nresulting from cyst rupture, proteinuria, and colicky abdominal pain from the ureteral passage of clots or calculi. Generally, about 10 years\\nafter symptoms appear, progressive compression of kidney structures by the enlarging mass produces renal failure and uremia. Hypertension is found in about 20% to 30% of children and up to 75% of adults due to intrarenal ischemia, which activates the renin-angiotensin system. Diagnosis A family history and a physical examination revealing large bilateral, irregular masses in the flanks strongly suggest polycystic kidney disease. In advanced stages, grossly enlarged and palpable kidneys make the diagnosis obvious. In patients with these findings, the following laboratory results are typical: Excretory urography reveals enlarged kidneys, with elongation of pelvis, flattening of the calyces, and indentations caused by cysts. Excretory urography of the neonate shows poor excretion of contrast medium. Ultrasound and computed tomography scan show kidney enlargement and the presence of cysts; tomography demonstrates multiple areas of cystic damage. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging technique because it's less expensive, doesn't require\\ncontrast or radiation exposure, and is easily and safely performed on children and pregnant females. Urinalysis and creatinine clearance tests are nonspecific tests that evaluate renal function and reveal urine protein or blood in the urine. Diagnosis must rule out the presence of renal tumors. Treatment Polycystic kidney disease can't be cured. The primary goal of treatment is preserving renal parenchyma and preventing infectious complications. Management of secondary hypertension will also\\nhelp prevent rapid deterioration in function. Progressive renal failure\\nrequires treatment similar to that for other types of renal disease, including dialysis or, rarely, kidney transplantation. When adult polycystic kidney disease is discovered in the\\nasymptomatic stage, careful monitoring is required, including urine cultures and creatinine clearance tests every 6 months. Prompt and vigorous antibiotic treatment is needed when a urine culture reveals infection\\u2014 even when the patient is asymptomatic. As renal impairment progresses, selected patients may undergo dialysis, transplantation, or both. Cystic abscess or retroperitoneal bleeding may require surgical drainage; intractable pain (a rare symptom) may also require surgery. However, because this disease affects both kidneys, nephrectomy usually isn't recommended because it increases the risk of infection in the remaining kidney. Special considerations Because polycystic kidney disease is usually relentlessly\\nprogressive, comprehensive patient teaching and emotional support are essential. P Refer the young adult patient or the parents of infants with polycystic kidney disease for genetic counseling. Parents will probably have many questions about the risk to other offspring. Provide supportive care to minimize any associated symptoms. Carefully assess the patient's lifestyle and his physical and mental status; determine how rapidly the disease is progressing. Use this information to plan individualized patient care. Acquaint yourself with all aspects of end-stage renal disease, including dialysis and transplantation, so you can provide appropriate care and patient teaching as the disease progresses. Explain all diagnostic procedures to the patient or to his family if the patient is an infant. Before beginning excretory urography or other procedures that use an iodinebased contrast\\nmedium, determine whether the patient has ever had an allergic reaction\\nto iodine or shellfish. Even if the patient has no history of allergy, watch for an allergic reaction after performing the procedures. Administer antibiotics as ordered for UTI.\\nStress to the patient the need to take the medication exactly as prescribed, even if symptoms are minimal or absent. ACUTE RENAL DISORDERS Acute renal failure Acute renal failure is the sudden interruption of kidney function due to obstruction, reduced circulation, or renal parenchymal disease. It's usually reversible with medical treatment; otherwise, it may progress to end-stage renal disease, uremic syndrome, and death. Causes and incidence The causes of acute renal failure are classified as prerenal, intrinsic (or parenchymal), and postrenal. Prerenal failure is\\nassociated with diminished blood flow to the kidneys, possibly resulting from hypovolemia, shock, severe anaphylaxis, embolism, blood loss, sepsis, pooling of fluid in ascites or burns, or from cardiovascular disorders, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and tamponade. Intrinsic renal failure results from damage to the kidneys themselves, usually due to acute tubular necrosis, but possibly due to acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, vasculitis, sickle-cell disease, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, nephrotoxins, chronic misuse of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, radiopaque contrast agents, ischemia, renal myeloma, acute pyelonephritis, and exposure to heavy metals, such as lead or mercury. Postrenal failure results from bilateral obstruction of urinary outflow. Its multiple causes include kidney stones, blood clots,\\npapillae from papillary necrosis, tumors, benign prostatic hyperplasia,\\nstrictures, and urethral edema from catheterization. In the United States, the annual incidence of acute renal\\nfailure is 100 cases for every million people. It's diagnosed in 1% of hospital admissions. Hospital-acquired acute renal failure occurs in 4% of all admitted patients and 20% of patients who are admitted to critical care units. Complications Volume overload Pulmonary edema Electrolyte imbalance Metabolic acidosis Signs and symptoms Acute renal failure is a critical illness. Its early signs are oliguria, azotemia and, rarely, anuria. Electrolyte imbalance,\\nmetabolic acidosis, and other severe effects follow, as the patient becomes increasingly uremic and renal dysfunction disrupts other body systems: GI: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, stomatitis, bleeding, hematemesis, dry mucous membranes, uremic breath P Central nervous system (CNS): headache, drowsiness, irritability, confusion, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, coma Cutaneous: dryness, pruritus, pallor, purpura and, rarely, uremic frost Cardiovascular: early in the disease, hypotension; later, hypertension, arrhythmias, fluid overload, heart failure, systemic edema, anemia, altered clotting mechanisms Respiratory: pulmonary edema, Kussmaul's respirations. Fever and chills indicate infection, a common complication. Diagnosis The patient's history may include a disorder that can cause renal failure. Blood test results indicating intrinsic acute renal\\nfailure include elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium levels and low blood pH, bicarbonate, hematocrit (HCT), and hemoglobin (Hb) level. Urine specimens show casts, cellular debris, decreased specific gravity and, in glomerular diseases, proteinuria and urine osmolality close to serum osmolality. Urine sodium level is less than 20 mEq/L if oliguria is due to decreased perfusion; more than 40 mEq/L if due to an intrinsic problem. Other studies include renal ultrasonography, kidney-ureter- bladder X-rays, cautious use of excretory urography, renal\\nscan, and nephrotomography. Treatment The goal of treatment is to correct or eliminate any reversible causes of kidney failure, such as obstructive uropathy, volume depletion, or the use of kidney-toxic medications. Supportive measures include a diet high in calories and low in protein, sodium, and\\npotassium, with supplemental vitamins and restricted fluids. Meticulous\\nelectrolyte monitoring is essential to detect hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia occurs, acute therapy may include dialysis, I.V. administration of hypertonic glucose, insulin infusion, and sodium bicarbonate, and administration of a potassium exchange resin (orally by\\nenema) to remove potassium from the body. If measures fail to control uremic symptoms, hemodialysis\\nor peritoneal dialysis may be necessary. Continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration are alternative hemodialysis techniques for the treatment of acute renal failure. They're generally reserved for when intermittent dialysis fails\\nto control hypervolemia or uremia, or for patients for whom peritoneal dialysis isn't possible. Special considerations Patient care includes careful monitoring and dietary education. Measure and record intake and output, including all body fluids, such as wound drainage, nasogastric output, and diarrhea. Weigh the patient daily. Assess Hb levels and HCT and replace blood components, as indicated. Don't use whole blood if the patient is prone to heart failure and can't tolerate extra fluid volume. Packed red blood cells deliver the necessary blood components without added volume. Monitor vital signs. Watch for and report any signs of pericarditis (pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, pericardial friction rub), inadequate renal perfusion (hypotension), and\\nacidosis. Maintain proper electrolyte balance. Strictly monitor potassium levels. Watch for symptoms of hyperkalemia (malaise, anorexia, paresthesia, or muscle weakness) and electrocardiogram changes (tall, peaked T waves, widening QRS segment, and disappearing P waves), and report them immediately. Avoid administering medications containing potassium. ALERT Assess the patient frequently, especially during emergency treatment to lower potassium levels. If the patient receives hypertonic glucose and insulin infusions, monitor potassium levels. If you give sodium polystyrene sulfonate rectally, make sure the patient doesn't retain it and become constipated, to prevent bowel perforation. P Maintain nutritional status. Provide a high-calorie, low-protein, low- sodium, and low-potassium diet, with vitamin supplements. Give the anorectic patient small, frequent meals. Use sterile technique, because the patient\\nwith acute renal failure is highly susceptible to infection. Personnel with upper respiratory tract infections shouldn't provide care for the patient. Prevent complications of immobility by encouraging frequent coughing and deep breathing and by performing passive range-of-motion exercises. Help the patient walk as soon as possible. Provide good mouth care frequently because\\nmucous membranes are dry. If stomatitis occurs, an antibiotic solution may be ordered. Have the patient swish the solution around in his mouth before swallowing. Monitor for GI bleeding by guaiac testing all stools for blood. Administer medications carefully, especially antacids and stool softeners. Use aluminum-hydroxide-based antacids; magnesium-based antacids can cause serum magnesium levels to rise to critical levels. Use appropriate safety measures, such as side rails and restraints, because the patient with CNS involvement may be dizzy or confused. Provide emotional support to the patient and his family. Reassure them by clearly explaining all procedures. If the patient requires hemodialysis, check the blood access site (arteriovenous fistula, subclavian or femoral catheter) as per facility protocol or every 2 hours for patency and signs of clotting. Don't use the arm with the shunt or fistula for taking blood pressures or drawing blood. Weigh the patient before beginning dialysis. During dialysis, monitor vital signs, clotting times, blood flow, the function of the vascular access site, and arterial and venous pressures. Watch for complications, such as septicemia, embolism, hepatitis, and rapid fluid and electrolyte loss. After dialysis, monitor vital signs and the vascular access site; weigh the patient; watch for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. During peritoneal dialysis, position the patient carefully. Elevate the head of the bed to reduce pressure on the\\ndiaphragm and aid respiration. Be alert for signs of infection (cloudy drainage, elevated temperature) and, rarely, bleeding. If pain occurs, reduce the amount of dialysate. Monitor the diabetic patient's blood glucose periodically, and administer insulin as ordered. Watch for complications, such as peritonitis, atelectasis, hypokalemia, pneumonia,\\nand shock. Use standard precautions when handling all blood and body fluids. PREVENTION Evaluate all drugs the patient is taking and determine which drugs may be affected by or have an effect on renal function. Aggresively restore fluid volume after major surgery or trauma. Acute pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis (also known as acute infective tubulointerstitial nephritis )\\nis a sudden inflammation caused by bacteria that primarily affects the interstitial area and the renal pelvis or, less often, the renal tubules. It's one of the most common renal diseases. With treatment and continued follow-up care, the prognosis is good, and extensive permanent\\ndamage is rare. (See Chronic pylenonephritis, page 386.) Causes and incidence Acute pyelonephritis results from bacterial infection of the kidneys. Infecting bacteria usually are normal intestinal and fecal flora that grow readily in urine. The most common causative organism is Escherichia coli, but Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis (formerly Streptococcus faecalis ) may also cause this infection. Typically, the infection spreads from the bladder to the ureters, then to the kidneys, as in vesicoureteral reflux due to congenital weakness at the junction of the ureter and the bladder. Bacteria refluxed to intrarenal tissues may create colonies of infection\\nwithin 24 to 48 hours. Infection may also result from instrumentation (such as catheterization, cystoscopy, or urologic surgery), from a hematogenic infection (as in septicemia or endocarditis), or possibly from lymphatic infection. P Pyelonephritis may also result from an inability to empty\\nthe bladder (for example, in patients with neurogenic bladder), urinary\\nstasis, or urinary obstruction due to tumors, strictures, or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Pyelonephritis occurs more commonly in women, probably because of a shorter urethra and the proximity of the urinary meatus to the vagina and the rectum\\u2014both of which allow bacteria to reach the bladder more easily\\u2014and a lack of the antibacterial prostatic secretions\\nproduced by men. Incidence increases with age and is higher in the following groups: Sexually active women: Intercourse increases the risk of bacterial contamination. Pregnant women: About 5% develop asymptomatic bacteriuria; if untreated, about 40% develop pyelonephritis. Diabetics: Neurogenic bladder causes incomplete emptying and urinary stasis; glycosuria may support bacterial growth in the urine. Persons with other renal diseases: Compromised renal function aggravates susceptibility. CHRONIC PYELONEPHRITIS Chronic pyelonephritis is a persistent kidney inflammation that can scar the kidneys and may lead to chronic renal failure. Its etiology may be bacterial, metastatic, or urogenous. This disease is most common in patients who are predisposed to recurrent acute pyelonephritis, such as those with urinary obstructions or vesicoureteral reflux. Patients with chronic pyelonephritis may have a childhood\\nhistory of unexplained fevers or bedwetting. Clinical effects may include flank pain, anemia, low urine specific gravity, proteinuria, leukocytes in urine and, especially in late stages, hypertension. Uremia\\nrarely develops from chronic pyelonephritis unless structural abnormalities exist in the excretory system. Bacteriuria may be intermittent. When no bacteria are found in the urine, diagnosis depends\\non excretory urography (renal pelvis may appear small and flattened) and renal biopsy. Effective treatment of chronic pyelonephritis requires control of hypertension, elimination of the existing obstruction (when possible), and long-term antimicrobial therapy. Complications Recurrence of pyelonephritis Sepsis Perinephric abscess Renal failure Signs and symptoms Typical clinical features include urgency, frequency, burning during urination, dysuria, nocturia, and hematuria (usually microscopic but may be gross). Urine may appear cloudy and have an ammonia-like or fishy odor. Other common symptoms include a temperature of 102\\u00b0 F (38.9\\u00b0 C) or higher, shaking chills, flank pain, anorexia, and\\ngeneral fatigue. These symptoms characteristically develop rapidly over a few hours or a few days. Although these symptoms may disappear within days, even without treatment, residual bacterial infection is likely and\\nmay cause symptoms to recur later. ELDER TIP Elderly patients may exhibit altered\\nmental status or GI or pulmonary symptoms rather than the usual febrile responses to pyelonephritis. PEDIATRIC TIP In children younger than age 2, fever, vomiting, nonspecific abdominal complaints, or failure to thrive P may be the only signs of acute pyelonephritis. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires urinalysis and culture. Typical findings include: Pyuria (pus in urine): Urine sediment reveals the presence of leukocytes singly, in clumps, and in casts; and,\\npossibly, a few red blood cells. Significant bacteriuria: Urine culture reveals more than 100,000 organisms/\\u00b5l of urine. Low specific gravity and osmolality: These findings result from a temporarily decreased ability to concentrate urine. Slightly alkaline urine pH. Proteinuria, glycosuria, and ketonuria: These conditions are less common. Costovertebral angle tenderness Excretory urography or computed tomography (CT) scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder also help in the evaluation of acute pyelonephritis by revealing calculi, tumors, or cysts in the kidneys and\\nthe urinary tract. In addition, excretory urography may show asymmetrical kidneys. Treatment Treatment centers on antibiotic therapy appropriate to the specific infecting organism after identification by urine culture and sensitivity studies. When the infecting organism can't be identified, therapy usually consists of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Urinary analgesics are also appropriate. ALERT If a woman is pregnant, antibiotics must be prescribed cautiously. Symptoms may disappear after several days of antibiotic therapy. Although urine usually becomes sterile within 48 to 72 hours, the course of such therapy is 10 to 14 days. Follow-up treatment may include reculturing urine 1 week after drug therapy stops, then periodically for the next year to detect residual or recurring infection. Most patients with uncomplicated infections respond well to therapy and don't suffer reinfection. In infection from obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux, antibiotics may be less effective; treatment may then necessitate surgery to relieve the obstruction or correct the anomaly. Patients at high risk of recurring urinary tract and kidney infections, such as those with prolonged use of an indwelling catheter or maintenance antibiotic therapy, require long- term follow-up. Recurrent episodes of acute pyelonephritis can eventually result in chronic pyelonephritis. Special considerations Patient care is supportive during antibiotic treatment of the underlying infection. Administer antipyretics for fever. Encourage fluids to achieve urine output of more than 2,000 ml/day. This helps to empty the bladder of contaminated urine. Don't encourage intake of more than 2 to 3 qt (2 to 3\\nL) because this may decrease the effectiveness of the antibiotics. Provide an acid-ash diet to prevent stone formation. Teach proper technique for collecting a clean-catch urine specimen. Be sure to refrigerate or culture a urine specimen within 30 minutes of collection to prevent overgrowth of bacteria. Stress the need to complete prescribed antibiotic therapy, even after symptoms subside. Encourage long-term follow-up care for high-risk patients. To prevent acute pyelonephritis: PREVENTION Observe strict sterile technique during catheter insertion and care. Instruct women to prevent bacterial contamination by wiping the perineum from front to back after defecation. Advise routine checkups for patients with a history of urinary tract infections. Teach them to recognize signs of infection, such as cloudy urine, burning on urination, urgency, and frequency, especially when accompanied by a low-grade fever. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), also known as acute glomerulonephritis, is a relatively common bilateral inflammation of the glomeruli. It usually follows a streptococcal infection of the respiratory tract or, less often, a skin infection such as impetigo. Causes and incidence APSGN results from the entrapment and collection of antigen-antibody (produced as an immunologic mechanism in response to streptococcus) in the glomerular capillary membranes, inducing inflammatory damage and impeding glomerular function. Sometimes, the immune complement further damages the glomerular membrane. The damaged and inflamed glomerulus loses the ability to be selectively permeable, and allows red blood cells (RBCs) and proteins to filter through as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls. Uremic poisoning may result. APSGN is most common in boys ages 3 to 7, but it can occur at any age. Incidence is rising in the United States and Europe, with epidemics occurring in developing countries in Africa, the West Indies, and the Middle East. Up to 95% of children and up to 70% of adults with APSGN recover fully; the rest may progress to chronic renal failure within months. Complications Acute or chronic kidney failure P End-stage renal disease Hypertension Heart failure Pulmonary edema Chronic glomerulonephritis Nephrotic syndrome Signs and symptoms APSGN begins within 1 to 3 weeks after untreated pharyngitis. Symptoms include mild to moderate edema, oliguria (less than 400 ml/24 hours), proteinuria, azotemia, hematuria, and fatigue. Mild to severe hypertension may result from either sodium or water retention (due to decreased GFR) or inappropriate renin release. Heart failure from hypervolemia leads to pulmonary edema. PEDIATRIC TIP The presenting features of APSGN in children may be encephalopathy with seizures and focal neurological deficits. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires a detailed patient history and assessment of clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Urinalysis typically reveals proteinuria and hematuria. RBCs, white blood cells, and mixed cell casts are common in urinary sediment. Elevated serum creatinine levels and low creatinine clearance accompany impaired glomerular filtration. Elevated antistreptolysin-O titers (in 80% of patients), elevated streptozyme and anti-DNase B titers, and low serum complement levels verify recent streptococcal infection. A throat culture may also show group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Renal ultrasound may show a normal or slightly enlarged kidney. A renal biopsy may confirm the diagnosis or assess renal tissue status. Treatment The goals of treatment are relief of symptoms and prevention of complications. Vigorous supportive care includes bed rest,\\nfluid and dietary sodium restrictions, and correction of electrolyte imbalances (possibly with dialysis, although this is rarely necessary). Therapy may include diuretics to reduce extracellular fluid overload and\\nan antihypertensive. The use of antibiotics is recommended for 7 to 10 days if staphylococcal infection is documented. Otherwise, antibiotic use is controversial. Special considerations APSGN usually resolves within 2 weeks, so patient care is primarily supportive. Check vital signs and electrolyte values. Monitor intake and output and daily weight. Assess renal function daily through serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine creatinine clearance levels. Watch for and immediately report signs of acute renal failure (oliguria, azotemia, and acidosis). Consult the dietitian to provide a diet high in calories and low in protein, sodium, potassium, and fluids. Protect the debilitated patient against secondary infection by providing good nutrition, using good hygienic technique, and preventing contact with infected persons. Bed rest is necessary during the acute phase. Allow the patient to gradually resume normal activities as symptoms subside. Provide emotional support for the patient and his family. If the patient is on dialysis, explain the procedure fully. Advise the patient with a history of chronic upper respiratory tract infections to immediately report signs of infection (fever, sore throat). Tell the patient that follow-up examinations are necessary to detect chronic renal failure. Stress the need for regular blood pressure, urinary protein, and renal function assessments during the convalescent months to detect recurrence. After APSGN, gross P hematuria may recur during nonspecific viral infections; abnormal urinary findings may persist for years. Encourage pregnant women with a history of\\nAPSGN to have frequent medical evaluations because pregnancy further stresses the kidneys and increases the risk of chronic renal failure. Acute tubular necrosis Acute tubular necrosis (ATN), also known as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, accounts for about 75% of all cases of acute renal failure and is the most common cause of acute renal failure in critically ill patients. ATN\\ninjures the tubular segment of the nephron, causing renal failure and uremic syndrome. Mortality ranges from 40% to 70%, depending on complications from underlying diseases. Nonoliguric forms of ATN have a better prognosis. Causes and incidence ATN results from ischemic or nephrotoxic injury, most commonly in debilitated patients, such as the critically ill or those who have undergone extensive surgery. In ischemic injury, disruption of blood flow to the kidneys may result from circulatory collapse, severe hypotension, trauma, hemorrhage, dehydration, cardiogenic or septic shock, surgery, anesthetics, or reactions to transfusions. Nephrotoxic injury may follow ingestion of certain chemical agents or result from a hypersensitive reaction of the kidneys. (See Rise in nephrotoxic injury .)\\nBecause nephrotoxic ATN doesn't damage the basement membrane of the nephron, it's potentially reversible. However, ischemic ATN can damage the epithelial and basement membranes and can cause lesions in the renal\\ninterstitium. ATN may result from: diseased tubular epithelium that allows leakage of glomerular filtrate across the membranes and reabsorption of filtrate into the blood obstruction of urine flow by the collection of damaged cells, casts, red blood cells (RBCs), and other cellular debris within the tubular walls ischemic injury to glomerular epithelial cells, resulting in cellular collapse and decreased glomerular capillary permeability ischemic injury to vascular endothelium, eventually resulting in cellular swelling and obstruction. Complications Fluid and electrolyte imbalance Heart failure GI hemorrhage Pulmonary edema Signs and symptoms Nephrotoxic injury causes multiple symptoms similar to those of renal failure, particularly azotemia, anemia, acidosis, overhydration, and hypertension. Some patients may also experience fever, rash, and eosinophilia. However, ATN is usually difficult to recognize in its early stages because effects of the critically ill patient's primary disease may mask the symptoms of ATN. The first recognizable effect may be decreased urine output. Generally, hyperkalemia and the characteristic uremic syndrome soon follow, with oliguria (or, rarely, anuria) and confusion, which may progress to uremic coma. Other possible complications may include heart failure, uremic pericarditis, pulmonary edema, uremic lung, anemia, anorexia, intractable vomiting, and poor wound healing due to debilitation. RISE IN NEPHROTOXIC INJURY Incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ingestion or inhalation of toxic substances is rising. ATN may occur in hospitalized patients following exposure to toxic agents, such as antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, or contrast material. Other nephrotoxic agents include pesticides, fungicides, heavy metals (for example, mercury, arsenic, lead, bismuth, uranium), and organic solvents\\ncontaining carbon tetrachloride or P ethylene glycol, such as cleaning fluids or industrial solvents. Ingestion of these substances may be accidental or intentional. ALERT Fever and chills may signal the onset of an infection, which is the leading cause of death in ATN. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually delayed until the condition has progressed to an advanced stage. The most significant laboratory clues are urinary sediment containing RBCs and casts, and dilute urine of a low specific gravity (1.010), low osmolality (less than 400 mOsm/kg), and high sodium level (40 to 60 mEq/L). Blood studies reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, anemia, defects in platelet adherence, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. An electrocardiogram may show arrhythmias (due to electrolyte imbalances) and, with hyperkalemia, widening QRS segment, disappearing P waves, and tall, peaked T waves. Treatment Treatment consists of identifying the nephrotoxic substance, eliminating its use, and removing it from the body, possibly by hemodialysis or hemoperfusion in extreme cases. Initial treatment may\\ninclude administration of diuretics and infusion of a large volume of fluids to flush tubules of cellular casts and debris and to replace fluid loss. However, this treatment carries a risk of fluid overload. Long-term fluid management requires daily replacement of projected and calculated losses (including insensible loss). Diet may be high in carbohydrates and low in protein, sodium, and potassium to minimize their build up in the body. During the course of acute renal failure, treatment is supportive. Other appropriate measures to control complications include transfusion of packed RBCs for anemia and administration of antibiotics for infection. Epogen may be given to stimulate RBC production as an alternative to blood transfusion. Hyperkalemia may require emergency I.V. administration of 50% glucose, regular insulin, and sodium bicarbonate. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate with sorbitol may be given by mouth or by enema to reduce extracellular potassium levels. Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be needed if the patient is catabolic. Special considerations Patient care is largely supportive. Maintain fluid balance. Watch for fluid overload, a common complication of therapy. Accurately record intake and\\noutput, including wound drainage, nasogastric output, and hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis balances. Weigh the patient daily. Monitor hemoglobin (Hb) levels and hematocrit, and administer blood products as needed. Use fresh packed cells instead of whole blood to prevent fluid overload and heart failure. Maintain electrolyte balance. Monitor laboratory results, and report imbalances. Enforce dietary restriction of foods containing sodium and potassium, such as bananas, orange juice,\\nand baked potatoes. Check for potassium content in prescribed medications (for example, potassium penicillin). Provide adequate calories and essential amino acids, while restricting protein intake to maintain an anabolic state. Total parenteral nutrition may be indicated in the severely debilitated or catabolic patient. Use sterile technique, particularly when handling catheters because the debilitated patient is vulnerable to infection. Immediately report fever, chills, delayed wound healing, or flank pain if the patient has an indwelling catheter in place. Watch for complications. If anemia worsens\\n(pallor, weakness, lethargy with decreased Hb level), administer RBCs as ordered. For acidosis, give sodium bicarbonate or assist with dialysis in severe cases, as ordered. Watch for signs of diminishing renal perfusion (hypotension and decreased urine output). Encourage coughing and deep breathing to prevent pulmonary complications. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises.\\nProvide good skin care; apply lotion or bath oil for dry skin. Help the\\npatient to walk as soon as possible, but guard against exhaustion. P Provide reassurance and emotional support.\\nEncourage the patient and his family to express their fears. Fully explain each procedure; repeat the explanation each time the procedure is done. Help the patient and his family set realistic goals according to individual prognosis. To prevent ATN, make sure patients are well hydrated before surgery or after X-rays that use a contrast medium.\\nAdminister mannitol, as ordered, to high-risk patients before and during these procedures. Carefully monitor patients receiving blood transfusions to detect early signs of transfusion reaction (fever, rash,\\nchills), and discontinue such transfusion immediately. PREVENTION Immediately treat disorders that cause a decrease in blood flow and oxygenation to the kidneys, such as severe hypotension and cardiogenic or septic shock. Proper hydration before surgery is very important. Adequate hydration after radio contrast dyes may allow for their excretion and reduce the risk of kidney damage. Proper typing and crossmatching before blood transfusions reduce the risk of incompatibility reactions. When a patient is exposed to drugs toxic to the renal system, monitor him carefully by checking levels regularly. Patients with diseases, such as diabetes, liver disease, and cardiac disorders, are at\\nhigher risk for ATN. These patients need to be well-controlled in order\\nto prevent the risk of ATN. Renal infarction Renal infarction is the formation of a coagulated, necrotic area in one or both kidneys that results from renal blood vessel occlusion. The location and size of the infarction depend on the site of vascular occlusion; most often, infarction affects the renal cortex, but it can extend into the medulla. (See Sites of renal infarction .) Residual renal function after infarction depends on the extent of the damage from the infarction. Causes and incidence In 75% of patients, renal infarction results from renal artery embolism secondary to mitral stenosis, infective endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, microthrombi in the left ventricle, rheumatic valvular disease, or recent myocardial infarction. The embolism reduces the rate of blood flow to renal tissue and leads to ischemia. The rate and degree of blood flow reduction determine whether or not the insult will be acute or chronic as arterial narrowing progresses. Less common causes of renal infarction are atherosclerosis, with or without thrombus\\nformation, and thrombus from flank trauma, sickle cell anemia, scleroderma, polyarteritis nodosa, and arterionephrosclerosis. Complications End-stage renal disease Granular kidneys Severe hypertension Cardiac hypertrophy Heart failure SITES OF RENAL INFARCTION The most common sites of renal infarction are illustrated below. P Signs and symptoms Although renal infarction may be asymptomatic, typical symptoms include severe upper abdominal pain or gnawing flank pain and tenderness, costovertebral tenderness, fever, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Gross hematuria may be present. When arterial occlusion causes\\ninfarction, the affected kidney is small and not palpable. Renovascular\\nhypertension, a frequent complication that may occur several days after\\ninfarction, results from reduced blood flow, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism. Diagnosis A history of predisposing cardiovascular disease or other\\nfactors in a patient with typical clinical features strongly suggests renal infarction. Firm diagnosis requires appropriate laboratory tests: Urinalysis reveals proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Urine enzyme levels, especially lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and alkaline phosphatase, are often elevated as a result of tissue destruction. Serum enzyme levels, especially aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and LD, are elevated. Blood studies may also reveal leukocytosis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Excretory urography shows diminished or absent excretion of contrast dye, indicating vascular occlusion or urethral obstruction. Isotopic renal scan, a benign, noninvasive technique, demonstrates absent or reduced blood flow to the kidneys. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Renal arteriography provides absolute proof of infarction but is used as a last resort because it's a high-risk procedure. Treatment Infection in the infarcted area or significant hypertension may require surgical repair of the occlusion or nephrectomy. Surgery to establish collateral circulation to the area can\\nrelieve renovascular hypertension. Persistent hypertension may respond to antihypertensives and a low- sodium diet. Additional treatments may include administration of intra- arterial streptokinase, lysis of blood clots, and heparin therapy. For bilateral emboli, intra-arterial streptokinase or transluminal angioplasty is recommended. If effective renal blood flow is obtained, long-term anticoagulation is recommended. Special considerations Assess the degree of renal function and offer supportive care to maintain homeostasis. Monitor intake and output, vital signs (particularly blood pressure), electrolytes, and daily weight. Watch for\\nsigns of fluid overload, such as dyspnea, tachycardia, pulmonary edema,\\nand electrolyte imbalances. Carefully explain all diagnostic procedures. Provide reassurance and emotional support for the patient and his family. Encourage the patient to return for follow-up examination, which usually includes excretory urography or a renal scan to assess regained renal function. Renal calculi Renal calculi or nephrolithiasis (commonly called kidney stones )\\nmay form anywhere in the urinary tract but usually develop in the renal pelvis or the calyces of the kidneys. Calculi formation follows precipitation of substances normally dissolved in the urine, such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate or, occasionally, urate or cystine. (See How urine pH affects calculi formation .)\\nRenal calculi vary in size and may be solitary or multiple. They may remain in the renal pelvis or enter the ureter and may damage renal parenchyma; large calculi cause pressure necrosis. In certain locations,\\ncalculi cause obstruction, with resultant hydronephrosis, and tend to recur. Causes and incidence Although the exact cause of renal calculi is unknown, predisposing factors include: Dehydration: Decreased urine production concentrates calculus- forming substances. Infection: Infected, damaged tissue serves as a site for calculus development; pH changes provide a favorable medium for calculus formation (especially for magnesium ammonium phosphate or calcium phosphate calculi); or infected calculi (usually magnesium ammonium phosphate or staghorn calculi) may develop if bacteria serve as the nucleus in calculus formation. Infections may promote destruction of renal parenchyma. Obstruction: Urinary stasis (as in immobility from spinal cord injury) allows calculus constituents to collect and adhere, forming calculi. Obstruction also promotes infection, which, in turn, compounds the obstruction. Metabolic factors: These factors may predispose to renal calculi: hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, elevated uric acid (usually with gout), defective metabolism of oxalate, genetic defect in metabolism of cystine, and excessive intake of vitamin D or dietary calcium. P Among Americans, renal calculi develop in 2% to 10% of the population, with people living in southeastern states having an increased risk. They're more common in men (especially those ages 30 to 40) than in women by a 3:1 ratio. They're rare in children. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HOW URINE pH AFFECTS CALCULI FORMATION The pH of the urine influences the types of calculi that may form. Some types of calculi tend to be familial; some are associated with other conditions, such as bowel disease, ileal bypass for obesity, or renal P tubule defects. Calcium calculi are most common, accounting for over 75% of all calculi, and are two to three times more common in males, usually appearing between ages 20 and 30. The calcium may combine with other substances, such as oxalate (the most common substance), phosphate, or carbonate, to form the stone. Oxalate is present in certain foods. Diseases of the small intestine increase the tendency to form calcium oxalate calculi. Recurrence is likely. Uric acid calculi are also more common in men and make up\\nabout 6% of all calculi. These calculi are associated with gout and chemotherapy. Cystine calculi, which make up about 2% of all calculi, may form in people with cystinuria, a hereditary disorder affecting both\\nmen and women. Struvite calculi, accounting for about 15% of all calculi, are mainly found in women as a result of a urinary tract infection (UTI). They can grow very large and may obstruct the kidney, ureter, or bladder. Indavir stones appear in patients with human immunodeficiency virus who are treated with the protease inhibitor indinavir. Complications Damage or destruction of renal parenchyma Pressure necrosis Hydronephrosis Bleeding Signs and symptoms Clinical effects vary with size, location, and etiology of the calculi. Pain, the key symptom, usually results from obstruction;\\nlarge, rough calculi occlude the opening to the ureter and increase the\\nfrequency and force of peristaltic contractions. The pain of classic renal colic travels from the costovertebral angle to the flank, to the suprapubic region and external genitalia. The intensity of this pain fluctuates and may be excruciating at its peak. If calculi are in the renal pelvis and calyces, pain may be more constant and dull. Back pain (from calculi that produce an obstruction within a kidney) and severe abdominal pain (from calculi traveling down a ureter) may also occur. (See Types of renal calculi .) Nausea and vomiting usually accompany severe pain. TYPES OF RENAL CALCULI Multiple small calculi may vary in size; they may remain in the renal pelvis or pass down the ureter. A staghorn calculus (a cast of the calyceal and pelvic collecting system) may form from a stone that stays in the kidney. Other associated signs include fever, chills, hematuria (when calculi abrade a ureter), abdominal distention, pyuria and, rarely, anuria (from bilateral obstruction, or unilateral obstruction in\\nthe patient with one kidney). Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture and the following tests: Computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging are highly sensitive for identifying hydronephrosis and detecting small renal and urethral stones. Excretory urography may be used for diagnosis of obstruction by urinary calculus. Kidney-ureter-bladder X-rays reveal most renal calculi. Calculus analysis shows mineral content. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS P Excretory urography confirms the diagnosis and determines size and location of calculi. Kidney ultrasonography is an easily performed, noninvasive, nontoxic test to detect obstructive changes such as hydronephrosis. Urine culture of midstream sample may indicate UTI. Urinalysis may be normal, or may show increased specific gravity and acid or alkaline pH suitable for different types of stone formation. Other urinalysis findings include hematuria (gross or microscopic), crystals (urate, calcium, or cystine),\\ncasts, and pyuria with or without bacteria and white blood cells. A 24-hour urine collection is evaluated for calcium oxalate, phosphorus, and uric acid excretion levels. Serial blood calcium and phosphorus levels\\ndetect hyperparathyroidism and show increased calcium level in proportion to normal serum protein. PREVENTION PREVENTING RENAL CALCULI The formation of kidney stones may be prevented by making\\ncertain lifestyle changes. If these lifestyles changes don't help in the prevention of kidney stone formation, drugs are needed. Advise your patient to make these changes. Maintain hydration The most important lifestyle change is drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. An adult needs to drink at least 3\\u00bd quarts per day. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the kidneys. Adjust diet For a patient who tends to form calcium and oxalate stones, suggest an oxalaterestricted diet. Foods that are high in oxalate should be avoided. These foods include rhubarb, star fruit, beets, beet greens, collards, okra, refried beans, spinach, swiss chard,\\nsweet potatoes, sesame seeds, almonds, and soy products. Restricting calcium in the diet doesn't seem to reduce the risk of kidney stones. Diets high in calcium actually help reduce the risk of oxalate stone formation. Calcium binds with oxalate so it can't be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted by the kidneys. All patients who form kidney stones should be on low sodium diets. Sodium intake should be restricted to 3 to 4 grams sodium per day. Also, diets very low in animal proteins may help reduce the risk of stones. Take prescribed drugs Drugs can be helpful in preventing stone formation. The drugs prescribed depend on the type of stone. Some stones, such as calcium stones, develop more easily in more alkaline environments, and some stones, such as uric acid stones, develop in an acid environment. Patients with struvite stones are treated with antibiotics to prevent infection. Cystine stones are the hardest to treat, and they're treated with a urine alkalinizer and chelator (D-Penicillamine and Thiola). Increased blood uric acid levels may indicate gout as the\\ncause. Diagnosis must rule out appendicitis, cholecystitis, peptic ulcer, and pancreatitis as potential sources of pain. Treatment Because 90% of renal calculi are smaller than 5 mm in diameter, treatment usually consists of measures to promote their natural passage. Along with vigorous hydration, such treatment includes antimicrobial therapy (varying with the cultured organism) for infection, analgesics such as meperidine for pain, and diuretics to prevent urinary stasis and further calculus formation (thiazides decrease calcium excretion into the urine). Prophylaxis to prevent calculus formation includes a low- P calcium diet for absorptive hypercalciuria, parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism, allopurinol for uric acid calculi, and daily administration of ascorbic acid by mouth to acidify the urine. (See Preventing renal calculi. ) Calculi too large for natural passage may require surgical removal. When a calculus is in the ureter, a cystoscope may be inserted through the urethra and the calculus manipulated with catheters\\nor retrieval instruments. Extraction of calculi from other areas (kidney calyx, renal pelvis) may necessitate a flank or lower abdominal approach. Percutaneous ultrasonic lithotripsy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy shatter the calculus into fragments for removal by suction or natural passage. Special considerations Patient care includes confirming the diagnosis, facilitating passage of the stone, and prevention of future occurrences. To aid diagnosis, maintain a 24- to 48-hour record of urine pH, with nitrazine pH paper; strain all urine through gauze or a tea strainer, and save all solid material recovered for analysis. To facilitate spontaneous passage, encourage the patient to walk if possible. Also promote sufficient intake of fluids to maintain a urine output of 3 to 4 L/day (urine should be very dilute and colorless). To help acidify urine, offer fruit\\njuices, particularly cranberry juice. If the patient can't drink the required amount of fluid, supplemental I.V. fluids may be given. Record intake and output and daily weight to assess fluid status and renal function. Stress the importance of proper diet and compliance with drug therapy. For example, if the patient's stone is caused by a hyperuricemic condition, advise him (or whoever prepares his\\nmeals) to avoid foods high in purine. Restrict protein to 60 g/day to decrease calcium and uric acid, and limit sodium to 3 to 4 g/day. Oxalate foods are restricted. If surgery is necessary, give reassurance by supplementing and reinforcing what the surgeon has told the patient about the procedure. The patient is apt to be fearful, especially if surgery includes removal of a kidney, so emphasize the fact that the body can adapt well to one kidney. If he's to have an abdominal or flank incision, teach deep-breathing and coughing exercises. After surgery, the patient will probably have an indwelling catheter or a nephrostomy tube. Unless one of his kidneys was removed, expect bloody drainage from the catheter. Never irrigate the catheter without a physician's order. Check dressings regularly for bloody drainage, and know how much drainage to expect. Immediately report suspected hemorrhage (excessive drainage, rising pulse rate). Use sterile technique when changing dressings or providing catheter care. Watch for signs of infection (rising fever, chills), and give antibiotics as ordered. To prevent pneumonia, encourage frequent position changes, and ambulate the patient as soon as\\npossible. Have him hold a small pillow over the operative site to splint the incision and thereby facilitate deep-breathing and coughing exercises. Before discharge, teach the patient and his family the importance of following the prescribed dietary and medication regimens to prevent recurrence of calculi. Encourage increased fluid intake. If appropriate, show the patient how to check his urine pH, and instruct him to keep a daily record. Tell him to immediately report symptoms of acute obstruction (pain, inability to void). Renal vein thrombosis Renal vein thrombosis\\u2014clotting in the renal vein\\u2014results in renal congestion, engorgement and, possibly, infarction. Thrombosis may affect both kidneys and may occur in an acute or a chronic form. Chronic thrombosis usually impairs renal function, causing nephrotic syndrome. Abrupt onset of thrombosis that causes extensive damage may precipitate rapidly fatal renal infarction. If thrombosis affects both kidneys, the prognosis is poor. However, less severe thrombosis that affects only one kidney, or gradual progression that allows development of collateral circulation, may preserve partial renal function. Causes and incidence P 7 Renal vein thrombosis often results from a tumor that obstructs the renal vein (usually hypernephroma). Other causes include thrombophlebitis of the inferior vena cava (may result from abdominal trauma) or blood vessels of the legs, heart failure, and periarteritis. PEDIATRIC TIP In infants, renal vein thrombosis usually follows diarrhea that causes severe dehydration. Chronic renal vein thrombosis is often a complication of other glomerulopathic diseases, such as amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetic nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Complications Fatal renal infarction Disseminated intravascular coagulation Signs and symptoms Clinical features of renal vein thrombosis vary with speed of onset. Rapid onset of venous obstruction produces severe lumbar\\npain and tenderness in the epigastric region and the costovertebral angle. Other characteristic features include fever, leukocytosis, pallor, hematuria, proteinuria, peripheral edema and, when the obstruction is bilateral, oliguria and other uremic signs. The kidneys enlarge and become easily palpable. Hypertension is unusual but may develop. Gradual onset causes symptoms of nephrotic syndrome. Peripheral edema is possible but pain is generally absent. Other clinical signs include proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Infants with this disease have enlarged kidneys, oliguria, and renal insufficiency that may progress to acute or chronic renal failure. Diagnosis A variety of tests are used to confirm diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis. Computed tomography scan with contrast is the procedure of choice because it reveals enlargement and distention of\\nthe affected renal vein with visualization of the clots within the vein. Excretory urography provides reliable diagnostic evidence. In acute renal vein thrombosis, the kidneys appear enlarged and excretory function diminishes. Contrast medium seems to \\u201csmudge\\u201d necrotic renal tissue. In chronic thrombosis, it may show ureteral indentations that result from collateral venous channels. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Renal arteriography and biopsy may also confirm the diagnosis. Venography confirms thrombosis. Urinalysis reveals gross or microscopic hematuria, proteinuria (more than 2 g/day in chronic disease), casts, and oliguria. Blood studies show leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Magnetic resonance imaging, abdominal X-ray, or abdominal ultrasound may show occlusion of the renal vein. Treatment Treatment is most effective for gradual thrombosis that affects only one kidney. Anticoagulation therapy reduces the incidence of new thrombus formation and often reverses the deterioration of renal function. Heparin is the initial therapy of choice. After 5 to 7 days, warfarin (Coumadin) therapy can be instituted for long-term care. Streptokinase or urokinase infusion may be successful in early resolution of acute renal vein thrombosis. Surgery is rarely used; it must be performed within 24 hours of thrombosis but even then has limited success because thrombi often extend into the small veins. Extensive intrarenal bleeding may necessitate nephrectomy. Patients who survive abrupt thrombosis with extensive renal damage develop nephrotic syndrome and require treatment for renal failure, such as dialysis and, possibly, transplantation. P PEDIATRIC TIP Some infants with renal vein thrombosis recover completely following heparin therapy or surgery; others suffer irreversible kidney damage. Special considerations Patient care includes careful monitoring of symptoms for signs of improvement or worsening. Assess renal function regularly. Monitor vital signs, intake and output, daily weight, and electrolytes. Administer diuretics for edema as ordered, and enforce dietary restrictions of sodium and potassium intake. Monitor closely for signs of pulmonary emboli (chest pain, dyspnea). If heparin is given by constant I.V. infusion, frequently monitor partial thromboplastin time to determine the patient's response. Dilute the drug; administer it by infusion pump or controller, so the patient receives the least amount necessary. ALERT During anticoagulant therapy, watch for and report signs of bleeding, such as tachycardia, hypotension, hematuria, bleeding from nose or gums, ecchymoses, petechiae, and tarry stools. Instruct the patient on maintenance warfarin therapy to use an electric razor and a soft toothbrush, and to avoid trauma. Suggest that he wear a medical identification bracelet, and tell him to avoid aspirin, which aggravates bleeding tendencies. Stress the need for close\\nfollow-up. CHRONIC RENAL DISORDERS Nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is a condition characterized by marked proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. (See What happens in nephrotic syndrome .)\\nAlthough nephrotic syndrome isn't a disease itself, it results from a specific glomerular defect and indicates renal damage. The prognosis is highly variable, depending on the underlying cause. Some forms may progress to end-stage renal failure. Causes and incidence About 75% of nephrotic syndrome cases result from primary (idiopathic) glomerulonephritis. Classifications include: In lipid nephrosis (nil lesions), the main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, the glomerulus looks normal by light microscopy. Some tubules may contain increased lipid deposits. Membranous glomerulonephritis, the most common lesion in adult idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, is characterized by uniform thickening of the glomerular basement membrane containing dense deposits and eventually progresses to renal failure. Focal glomerulosclerosis can develop spontaneously at any age, follow renal transplantation, or result from heroin abuse. Reported incidence of this condition is 10% in\\nchildren with nephrotic syndrome and up to 20% in adults. Lesions initially affect the deeper glomeruli, causing hyaline sclerosis, with later involvement of the superficial glomeruli. These lesions generally cause slowly progressive deterioration in renal function. Remissions occur occasionally. In membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, slowly progressive lesions develop in the subendothelial region of the basement membrane. Lesions may follow infection, particularly streptococcal infection. This disease occurs primarily in children and young adults. Other causes of nephrotic syndrome include metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus; collagen-vascular disorders, such as\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus and periarteritis nodosa; circulatory diseases, such as heart failure, sickle cell anemia, and renal vein thrombosis; nephrotoxins, such as mercury, gold, and bismuth; allergic reactions; and infections, such as tuberculosis or enteritis. Other possible causes are pregnancy, hereditary nephritis, multiple myeloma, and other P neoplastic diseases. These diseases increase glomerular protein permeability, leading to increased urinary excretion of protein, especially albumin, and subsequent hypoalbuminemia. Nephrotic patients have an increased risk of infection, particularly of peritonitis. PEDIATRIC TIP Black children appear to be at greater risk for peritonitis. Complications Atherosclerosis Renal vein thrombosis Acute renal failure Chronic renal failure Infections Malnutrition Fluid overload Signs and symptoms The dominant clinical feature of nephrotic syndrome is mild to severe dependent edema of the ankles or sacrum, or periorbital edema, especially in children. Edema may lead to ascites, pleural effusion, and swollen external genitalia. Accompanying symptoms may include orthostatic hypotension, lethargy, anorexia, depression, and pallor. Major complications are malnutrition, infection, coagulation disorders, thromboembolic vascular occlusion, and\\naccelerated atherosclerosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN NEPHROTIC SYNDROME Diagnosis Consistent proteinuria in excess of 3.5 g for 24 hours strongly suggests nephrotic syndrome; examination of urine also reveals increased number of hyaline, granular, and waxy, fatty casts, and oval fat bodies. Serum values that support the diagnosis are increased cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides and decreased albumin levels. Histologic identification of the lesion requires kidney biopsy. Other tests may be done to rule out metabolic causes. Treatment The goals of treatment of nephrotic syndrome are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and delay progressive kidney damage. Treatment of the causative disorder\\u2014possibly lifelong\\u2014is necessary to control nephrotic syndrome. Corticosteroid, immunosuppressive, P antihypertensive, and diuretic medications may help control symptoms. Antibiotics may be needed to control infections. Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors may significantly reduce the degree of protein loss in urine and are therefore typically prescribed for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome. Treatment of hypertension and of high cholesterol and triglyceride levels are also recommended to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and complications. Dietary limitation of cholesterol and\\nsaturated fats may be of little benefit because the high levels that accompany this condition seem to result from overproduction by the liver rather than from excessive fat intake. High-protein diets are of debatable value. In many patients, reducing the amount of protein in the\\ndiet produces a decrease in urine protein. In most cases, a moderateprotein diet (1 g/kg of body weight per day) is usually recommended. Sodium may be restricted to help control edema. Vitamin D may need to be replaced if nephrotic syndrome is chronic and unresponsive to therapy. Blood thinners may be required to treat or prevent clot formation. Supportive treatment consists of protein replacement with\\ninfusion of salt-poor albumin or with a nutritional diet of 1.5 g protein/kg of body weight, with restricted sodium intake of 0.5 to 1 g/day; diuretics for edema; and antibiotics for infection. Some patients respond to an 8-week course of corticosteroid therapy (such as prednisone), followed by a maintenance dose. Others respond better to a combination course of prednisone and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Special considerations Patient care includes identification and treatment of the underlying cause accompanied by supportive care during treatment. Frequently check urine protein. (Urine containing protein appears frothy.) Measure blood pressure while the patient is supine and also while he's standing; immediately report a drop in blood pressure that exceeds 20 mm Hg. ALERT After kidney biopsy, watch for bleeding and shock. Monitor intake and output and check weight\\nat the same time each morning\\u2014after the patient voids and before he eats\\u2014and while he's wearing the same kind of clothing. Ask the dietitian\\nto plan a high- protein, low-sodium diet. Provide good skin care because the patient with nephrotic syndrome usually has edema. To avoid thrombophlebitis, encourage activity and exercise, and provide antiembolism stockings as ordered. Watch for and teach the patient and his family how to recognize adverse drug effects, such as bone marrow toxicity from cytotoxic immunosuppressants and cushingoid symptoms (muscle weakness, mental changes, acne, moon face, hirsutism, girdle obesity, purple striae, bone fractures, amenorrhea) from long-term steroid therapy. Other steroid complications include masked infections, increased susceptibility to infections, ulcers, GI bleeding, and steroid-induced diabetes; a steroid crisis may occur if the drug is discontinued abruptly. To prevent GI complications, administer steroids with an antacid or with cimetidine or ranitidine. Explain that steroid adverse effects will subside when therapy stops. Offer the patient and his family reassurance and support, especially during the acute phase, when edema is severe and the patient's body image changes. Chronic glomerulonephritis A slowly progressive disease, chronic glomerulonephritis is characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli, which results in sclerosis, scarring, and eventual renal failure. This condition usually remains subclinical until the progressive phase begins, marked by proteinuria, cylindruria (presence of granular tube casts), and hematuria. By the time it produces symptoms, chronic glomerulonephritis is usually irreversible. P Causes and incidence Common causes of chronic glomerulonephritis include primary renal disorders, such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, focal glomerulosclerosis,\\nrapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and, less often, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Systemic disorders that may cause chronic glomerulonephritis include lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture's syndrome, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Chronic glomerulonephritis is twice as common in men as it is in women. Complications End-stage renal disease Severe hypertension Heart failure Increased susceptibility to infections Nephrotic syndrome Signs and symptoms Chronic glomerulonephritis typically develops insidiously\\nand asymptomatically, usually over many years. At any time, however, it\\nmay suddenly become progressive, producing nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, proteinuria, and hematuria. In late stages of progressive chronic glomerulonephritis, it may accelerate to uremic symptoms, such as azotemia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dyspnea, malaise, and fatigability. Mild to severe edema and anemia may accompany these symptoms. Severe hypertension may cause cardiac hypertrophy, leading to heart failure, and may accelerate the development of advanced renal failure, eventually necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Diagnosis Patient history and physical assessment seldom suggest glomerulonephritis. Suspicion develops from urinalysis revealing proteinuria, hematuria, cylindruria, and red blood cell casts. Rising blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels indicate advanced renal insufficiency. X-ray or ultrasound shows smaller kidneys. Kidney biopsy identifies the underlying disease and provides data needed to guide therapy. Treatment Treatment is essentially nonspecific and symptomatic, with its goals to control hypertension with antihypertensives and a sodium-restricted diet, to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances through restrictions and replacement, to reduce edema with diuretics such as furosemide, and to prevent heart failure. Treatment may also include antibiotics (for symptomatic urinary tract infections [UTIs]), dialysis, or transplantation. Special considerations Patient care is primarily supportive, focusing on continual observation and sound patient teaching. Accurately monitor vital signs, intake and\\noutput, and daily weight to evaluate fluid retention. Observe for signs\\nof fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalances. Ask the dietitian to plan low-sodium, high-calorie meals with adequate protein. Administer medications as ordered, and provide good skin care (because of pruritus and edema) and oral hygiene.\\nInstruct the patient to continue taking prescribed antihypertensives as\\nscheduled, even if he's feeling better, and to report any adverse effects. Advise him to take diuretics in the morning, so he won't have to disrupt his sleep to void. Teach him how to assess ankle edema. Warn the patient to report signs of infection, particularly UTI, and to avoid contact with persons who have infections. Urge follow-up examinations to assess renal function. Help the patient adjust to this illness by\\nencouraging him to express his feelings. Explain all necessary procedures beforehand, and answer the patient's questions about them. P Renovascular hypertension Renovascular hypertension is a rise in systemic blood pressure resulting from stenosis of the major renal arteries or their branches or from intrarenal atherosclerosis. This narrowing or sclerosis\\nmay be partial or complete, and the resulting blood pressure elevation,\\nbenign or malignant. Causes and incidence Stenosis or occlusion of the renal artery stimulates the affected kidney to release the enzyme renin, which converts angiotensinogen \\u2014a plasma protein\\u2014to angiotensin I. As angiotensin I circulates through the lungs and liver, it converts to angiotensin II, which causes peripheral vasoconstriction, increased arterial pressure and aldosterone secretion and, eventually, hypertension. Atherosclerosis (especially in older men) and fibromuscular diseases of the renal artery wall layers\\u2014such as medial fibroplasia and, less commonly, intimal and subadventitial fibroplasia\\u2014are the primary causes in 95% of all patients with renovascular hypertension. Other causes include arteritis, anomalies of the renal arteries, embolism, trauma, tumor, and dissecting aneurysm. Less than 5% of patients with high blood pressure display renovascular hypertension; it's most common in persons younger than age 30 or older than age 50. PEDIATRIC TIP Fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension in children. The surgical cure rate is very high. Complications Heart failure Myocardial infarction Stroke Renal failure (occasionally) Signs and symptoms In addition to elevated systemic blood pressure, renovascular hypertension usually produces symptoms common to hypertensive states, such as headache, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, lightheadedness, decreased tolerance of temperature extremes, retinopathy, and mental sluggishness. Significant complications include heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke and, occasionally, renal failure. Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed by the following tests: CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Arterial digital subtraction angiography with assays of venous renin is the definitive diagnostic procedure. When stenosis is significant, transluminal angioplasty can be done during the same procedure. Gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance angiography can identify turbulent blood flow indicative of renal stenosis. Duplex Doppler ultrasonography scans the renal artery and will reveal stenosis but results vary. Oral captopril renography is the simplest,\\nnoninvasive test for detection of renovascular hypertension but has a relatively high false- positive rate. Treatment Surgery, the treatment of choice, is performed to restore\\nadequate circulation and to control severe hypertension or severely impaired renal function by renal artery bypass, endarterectomy, arterioplasty or, as a last resort, nephrectomy. Balloon catheter renal artery dilation is used in selected cases to correct renal artery stenosis without the risks and P morbidity of surgery. Symptomatic measures include antihypertensives, diuretics, and a sodium-restricted diet. Medications that may be used in an attempt to control blood pressure include diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and alpha-adrenergic blockers. Diazoxide or nitroprusside may be given in the hospital if symptoms are acute. Response to medications is highly individual and the dosage or specific drug used may need frequent adjustment. Lifestyle changes may be recommended, including weight, exercise, dietary adjustments, smoking cessation, and avoidance of alcohol. These habits add to the effects of hypertension in causing complications. Special considerations The care plan must emphasize helping the patient and his family understand renovascular hypertension and the importance of following the prescribed treatment. Accurately monitor intake and output and daily weight. Check blood pressure in both arms regularly, with the patient lying down and standing. A drop of 20 mm Hg or more on arising may necessitate an adjustment in antihypertensive medications. Assess renal function daily. Maintain fluid and sodium restrictions. Explain the purpose of a low- sodium diet. Explain the diagnostic tests, and prepare the patient appropriately; for example, adequately hydrate the patient before tests that use contrast media. Make sure the patient isn't allergic to the dye used in diagnostic tests. After excretory urography or arteriography, watch for complications. If a nephrectomy is necessary, reassure the patient that the remaining kidney is adequate for renal function. ALERT Postoperatively, watch for bleeding and hypotension. If the sutures around the renal vessels slip, the patient can quickly go into shock because kidneys receive 25% of cardiac\\noutput. Provide a quiet, stress-free environment if possible. Urge the patient and his family members to have regular blood pressure screenings. PREVENTION Preventing atherosclerosis can help prevent renovascular hypertension. To reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, give patients this advice. Stop smoking because smoking damages the arteries. Get regular exercise. Regular exercise improves circulation and helps develop collateral blood vessels. Eat a healthy diet. Eating a diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium can help control weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Manage stress. Some stress-reduction techniques include deep breathing and stretching exercises. Hydronephrosis Hydronephrosis is an abnormal dilation of the renal pelvis and the calyces of one or both kidneys, caused by an obstruction of urine flow in the genitourinary tract. Although partial obstruction and hydronephrosis may not produce symptoms initially, the pressure built up behind the area of obstruction eventually results in symptomatic renal dysfunction. Causes and incidence Almost any type of obstructive uropathy can result in hydronephrosis. The most common causes are benign prostatic hyperplasia,\\nurethral strictures, and calculi; less common causes include strictures\\nor stenosis of the ureter or bladder outlet, congenital abnormalities, abdominal tumors, blood clots, and neurogenic bladder. If obstruction is\\nin the urethra or bladder, hydronephrosis is usually bilateral; if obstruction is in a ureter, it's usually unilateral. Obstructions distal\\nto the bladder cause the bladder to dilate and act as a buffer zone, delaying hydronephrosis. Total obstruction of urine flow with dilation of the collecting system ultimately causes complete cortical atrophy and\\ncessation of glomerular filtration. Hydronephrosis occurs in 1 out of every 100 people. Complications Pyelonephritis Paralytic ileus Renal failure Signs and symptoms Clinical features of hydronephrosis vary with the cause of the obstruction. In some patients, hydronephrosis produces no symptoms or only mild pain and slightly decreased urinary flow; in others, it may produce severe, colicky renal pain or dull flank pain that may radiate to the groin, and gross urinary abnormalities, such as hematuria, pyuria, dysuria, alternating oliguria and polyuria, or complete anuria. Other symptoms of hydronephrosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal fullness, pain on urination, dribbling, or hesitancy. Unilateral obstruction may cause pain on only one side, usually in the flank area. The most common complication of an obstructed kidney is infection (pyelonephritis) due to stasis that exacerbates renal damage and may create a life-threatening crisis. Paralytic ileus frequently accompanies acute obstructive uropathy. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS While the patient's clinical features may suggest hydronephrosis, excretory urography, isotope renography (radioisotope scan of the kidneys), computed P 4 tomography scan of the kidneys or abdomen, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, renal ultrasound, and renal function studies are necessary to confirm it. Treatment The goals of treatment are to preserve renal function and\\nprevent infection through surgical removal of the obstruction, such as dilation for stricture of the urethra or prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. If renal function has already been affected, therapy may include a diet low in protein, sodium, and potassium. This diet is designed to stop the progression of renal failure before surgery. Inoperable obstructions may necessitate decompression and drainage of the kidney using a nephrostomy tube placed temporarily or permanently in\\nthe renal pelvis or placement of a ureteral stent to allow the ureter to drain. Concurrent infection requires appropriate antibiotic therapy. Special considerations Explain hydronephrosis as well as the purpose of excretory urography and other diagnostic procedures. Check the patient for allergy to excretory urography dye. Administer medication for pain, as needed and prescribed. Postoperatively, closely monitor intake and output, vital signs, and fluid and electrolyte status. Watch for a rising pulse rate and cold, clammy skin, which indicate possible impending hemorrhage and shock. Monitor renal function studies daily. If a nephrostomy tube has been inserted, check it frequently for bleeding and patency. Irrigate the tube only as ordered, and don't clamp it. If the patient is to be discharged with a nephrostomy tube in place, teach him how to care for it properly. PREVENTION To prevent progression of hydronephrosis to irreversible renal disease, urge older men (especially\\nthose with family histories of benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis) to have routine medical checkups. Teach them to recognize and report symptoms of hydronephrosis (colicky pain, hematuria) or urinary tract infection. Renal tubular acidosis Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)\\u2014a syndrome of persistent dehydration, hyperchloremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and nephrocalcinosis \\u2014results from the kidneys' inability to conserve bicarbonate. This disorder occurs as distal RTA (Type I, or classic RTA)\\nor proximal RTA (Type II). The prognosis is usually good but depends on\\nthe severity of renal damage that precedes treatment. Causes and incidence Metabolic acidosis usually results from renal excretion of bicarbonate. However, metabolic acidosis associated with RTA results from a defect in the kidneys' normal tubular acidification of urine. Distal RTA results from an inability of the distal tubule\\nto secrete hydrogen ions against established gradients across the tubular membrane. This results in decreased excretion of titratable acids and ammonium, increased loss of potassium and bicarbonate in the urine, and systemic acidosis. Prolonged acidosis causes mobilization of calcium from bone and, eventually, hypercalciuria, predisposing the kidney to the formation of renal calculi. Distal RTA may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary distal RTA may occur sporadically or through a hereditary defect and is most prevalent in women, older children, adolescents, and young adults. It can also be caused by certain drugs, such as amphotericin B, lithium, and analgesics. P Secondary distal RTA has been linked to many renal or systemic conditions, such as starvation, malnutrition, hepatic cirrhosis, and several genetically transmitted disorders. Proximal RTA results from defective reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubule. This causes bicarbonate to flood the\\ndistal tubule, which normally secretes hydrogen ions, and leads to impaired formation of titratable acids and ammonium for excretion. Ultimately, metabolic acidosis results. Proximal RTA occurs in two forms: In primary proximal RTA, the reabsorptive defect is idiopathic and is the only disorder present. In secondary proximal RTA, the reabsorptive defect may be one of several defects and is due to proximal tubular cell damage from a disease such as Fanconi's syndrome. Complications Pyelonephritis Hypercalciuria Renal calculi Signs and symptoms PEDIATRIC TIP In infants, RTA produces anorexia, vomiting, occasional fever, polyuria, dehydration, growth retardation, apathy, weakness, tissue wasting, constipation, nephrocalcinosis, and rickets. In children and adults, RTA may lead to urinary tract infection, rickets, and growth problems. Possible complications of RTA include nephrocalcinosis and pyelonephritis. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Demonstration of impaired acidification of urine with systemic metabolic acidosis confirms distal RTA. Demonstration of bicarbonate wasting caused by impaired reabsorption confirms proximal RTA. Other relevant laboratory results show: decreased serum bicarbonate, pH, potassium, and phosphorus increased serum chloride and alkaline phosphatase alkaline pH, with low titratable acids and\\nammonium content in urine; increased urinary bicarbonate and potassium;\\nlow specific gravity. In later stages, X-rays may show nephrocalcinosis. Treatment Supportive treatment for patients with RTA requires replacement of those substances being abnormally excreted, especially bicarbonate, and may include sodium bicarbonate tablets or solution to control acidosis. Potassium may be given by mouth for dangerously low potassium levels. Vitamins D and calcium supplements are usually avoided\\nbecause the tendency toward nephrocalcinosis persists even after bicarbonate therapy. If pyelonephritis occurs, treatment may include antibiotics as well. Treatment for renal calculi secondary to nephrocalcinosis\\nvaries and may include supportive therapy until the calculi pass or until surgery for severe obstruction is performed. Special considerations Urge compliance with all medication instructions. Inform the patient and his family that the prognosis for RTA and bone lesion healing is directly related to the adequacy of treatment. Monitor laboratory values, especially potassium, for hypokalemia. Test urine for pH, and strain it for calculi. If rickets develops, explain the condition and its treatment to the patient and his family. P Teach the patient how to recognize signs and symptoms of calculi (hematuria, low abdominal or flank pain). Tell him to immediately report signs and symptoms. Instruct the patient with low potassium levels to eat foods with a high potassium content, such as bananas, leafy green vegetables, and baked potatoes. Orange juice is also high in\\npotassium. Because RTA may be caused by a genetic defect, encourage family members to seek genetic counseling or screening\\nfor this disorder. Chronic renal failure Chronic renal failure is usually the end result of a gradually progressive loss of renal function; occasionally, it's the result of a rapidly progressive disease of sudden onset. Few symptoms develop until after more than 75% of glomerular filtration is lost; then\\nthe remaining normal parenchyma deteriorates progressively, and symptoms worsen as renal function decreases. If this condition continues unchecked, uremic toxins accumulate and produce potentially fatal physiologic changes in all major organ systems. If the patient can tolerate it, maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation can sustain life. (See Comparing peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis . Also see Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, page 408.) Causes and incidence Diabetes and hypertension are the primary causes of chronic renal failure, accounting for two-thirds of cases. Other causes of chronic renal failure include: chronic glomerular disease such as glomerulonephritis chronic infections, such as chronic pyelonephritis or tuberculosis congenital anomalies such as polycystic kidneys vascular diseases such as renal nephrosclerosis obstructive processes such as calculi collagen diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus nephrotoxic agents such as long-term aminoglycoside therapy. These conditions gradually destroy the nephrons and eventually cause irreversible renal failure. Similarly, acute renal failure that fails to respond to treatment becomes chronic renal failure. This syndrome may progress through the following stages: reduced renal reserve (creatinine clearance glomerular filtration rate [GFR] is 40 to 70 ml/minute) renal insufficiency (GFR 20 to 40 ml/ minute) renal failure (GFR 10 to 20 ml/minute) end-stage renal disease (GFR less than 10 ml/minute). Chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease affect about 2 out of 1,000 people in the United States. Complications Fatal physiologic changes in all major organs Anemia Peripheral neuropathy Cardiopulmonary complication GI complication Sexual dysfunction Dry skin Fractures Signs and symptoms Chronic renal failure produces major changes in all body systems: Renal and urologic: Initially, salt-wasting and consequent hyponatremia produce hypotension, dry mouth, loss of skin turgor, listlessness, fatigue, and nausea; later, somnolence and confusion P develop. As the number of functioning nephrons decreases, so does the kidneys' capacity to excrete\\nsodium, resulting in salt retention and overload. Accumulation of potassium causes muscle irritability, then muscle weakness as the potassium level continues to rise. Fluid overload and metabolic acidosis\\nalso occur. Urinary output decreases; urine is very dilute and contains\\ncasts and crystals. Cardiovascular: Renal failure leads to hypertension, arrhythmias (including life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation), cardiomyopathy, uremic pericarditis, pericardial effusion with possible cardiac tamponade, heart failure, and periorbital and peripheral edema. Respiratory: Pulmonary changes include reduced pulmonary macrophage activity with increased susceptibility to infection, pulmonary edema, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub and effusions, crackles, thick sputum, uremic pleuritis and uremic lung (or uremic pneumonitis), dyspnea due to heart failure, and Kussmaul's respirations as a result of acidosis. GI: Inflammation and ulceration of GI mucosa cause stomatitis, gum ulceration and bleeding and, possibly, parotitis, esophagitis, gastritis, duodenal ulcers, lesions on the small and large bowel, uremic\\ncolitis, pancreatitis, and proctitis. Other GI symptoms include a metallic taste in the mouth, uremic fetor (ammonia smell to breath), anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Cutaneous: Typically, the skin is pallid, yellowish bronze, dry, and scaly. Other cutaneous symptoms include severe itching; purpura; ecchymoses; petechiae; uremic frost (most often in critically ill or terminal patients); thin, brittle fingernails with characteristic lines; and dry,\\nbrittle hair that may change color and fall out easily. Neurologic: Restless leg syndrome, one of the first signs of peripheral neuropathy, causes pain, burning, and itching in the legs and feet, which may be relieved by voluntarily shaking, moving, or rocking them. Eventually, this condition progresses to paresthesia and motor nerve dysfunction (usually bilateral footdrop) unless dialysis is initiated. Other signs and symptoms include muscle cramping and twitching, shortened memory and attention span, apathy, drowsiness, irritability, confusion, coma, and seizures. EEG changes indicate metabolic encephalopathy. Endocrine: Common endocrine abnormalities include stunted growth patterns in children (even with elevated growth hormone levels), infertility and decreased libido in both sexes, amenorrhea and cessation of menses in females, and impotence, decreased sperm production, and testicular atrophy in males. Increased aldosterone secretion (related to increased renin production) and impaired carbohydrate metabolism (increased blood glucose levels similar to diabetes mellitus) may also occur. Hematopoietic: Anemia, decreased red blood cell (RBC) survival time, blood loss from dialysis and GI bleeding, mild thrombocytopenia, and platelet defects occur. Other problems include increased bleeding and clotting disorders,\\ndemonstrated by purpura, hemorrhage from body orifices, easy bruising, ecchymoses, and petechiae. Skeletal: Calcium-phosphorus imbalance and consequent parathyroid hormone imbalances cause muscle and bone pain, skeletal demineralization, pathologic fractures, and calcifications in the brain, eyes, gums, joints, myocardium, and blood vessels. Arterial calcification may produce coronary artery disease. In children, renal osteodystrophy (renal rickets) may develop. COMPARING PERITONEAL DIALYSIS AND HEMODIALYSIS Advantages, disadvantages, and complications of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis are described below. Type Advantages Disadvantages Possible complications Peritoneal dialysis \\u25aa Can be performed immediately \\u25aa Requires less complex equipment and less specialized personnel than hemodialysis \\u25aa Requires small amounts of heparin or none at all \\u25aa Contraindicated within 72 hours of abdominal surgery \\u25aa Requires 48 to 72 hours for significant response to treatment \\u25aa Severe protein loss necessitates high- \\u25aa Bacterial or chemical peritonitis \\u25aa Pain (abdominal, low back, shoulder) \\u25aa Shortness of breath, or dyspnea \\u25aa Atelectasis and pneumonia \\u25aa No blood loss; minimal cardiovascular stress \\u25aa Can be performed by patient anywhere (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis), without assistance and with minimal patient teaching \\u25aa Allows patient independence without long interruptions in daily activities because exchange may be done at night while he sleeps \\u25aa Lower infection rate \\u25aa Lower cost protein diet (up to 100 g/day) \\u25aa High risk of peritonitis; repeated bouts may cause scarring, preventing further treatments with peritoneal dialysis \\u25aa Urea clearance less than with hemodialysis (60%) \\u25aa Severe loss of protein into the dialysis solution in the abdominal cavity (10 to 20 g/day) \\u25aa Fluid overload \\u25aa Excessive fluid loss \\u25aa Constipation \\u25aa Catheter site inflammation, infection, or leakage \\u25aa Anorexia \\u25aa Hypertriglyceridemia \\u25aa Abdominal hernias Hemodialysis \\u25aa Takes only 3 to 5 hours per treatment \\u25aa Faster results in an acute situation \\u25aa Total number of hours of maintenance treatment that's only half that of peritoneal dialysis \\u25aa In an acute situation, can use an I.V. route without a surgical access route \\u25aa Requires surgical creation of a vascular access between circulation and dialysis machine \\u25aa Requires complex water treatment, dialysis equipment, and highly trained personnel \\u25aa Requires administration of larger amounts of heparin \\u25aa Confines patient to special treatment unit \\u25aa Septicemia \\u25aa Air emboli \\u25aa Rapid fluid and electrolyte imbalance (disequilibrium syndrome) \\u25aa Hemolytic anemia \\u25aa Metastatic calcification \\u25aa Increased risk of hepatitis \\u25aa Hypotension or hypertension \\u25aa Itching \\u25aa Pain (generalized or in chest) \\u25aa Heparin overdose, possibly causing hemorrhage \\u25aa Leg cramps \\u25aa Nausea and vomiting P P \\u25aa Headache CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a useful alternative to hemodialysis in patients with renal failure. Using the peritoneum as a dialysis membrane, it allows almost uninterrupted exchange of dialysis solution. With this method, four to six exchanges of fresh dialysis solution are infused each day. The approximate dwell- time for daytime exchanges is 5 hours; for overnight exchanges, the dwell-time is 8 to 10 hours. After each dwell-time, the patient removes the dialyzing solution by gravity drainage. This form of dialysis offers the unique advantages of a simple, easily taught procedure and patient independence from a special treatment center. After applying a mask, the patient attaches a bag of dialysate to the tube entering his abdominal area so that the fluid flows into the peritoneal cavity. The patient can remove the mask when this step is completed. While the dialysate remains in the peritoneal cavity, the patient rolls up the bag, places it under his shirt, and goes about his\\nnormal activities. After applying a mask, the patient unrolls the bag and suspends it below his pelvis to allow the dialysate to drain from the peritoneal cavity back into the bag. Diagnosis Diagnosis of chronic renal failure is based on clinical assessment, a history of chronic progressive debilitation, and gradual deterioration of renal function as determined by creatinine clearance tests. The following laboratory findings also aid in diagnosis: Blood studies show elevated blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium levels; decreased arterial pH and bicarbonate; and low hemoglobin (Hb) level and hematocrit (HCT). Urine specific gravity becomes fixed at 1.010; urinalysis may show proteinuria, glycosuria, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and casts, depending on the etiology. X-ray studies include kidney-ureter-bladder films, excretory urography, nephrotomography, renal scan, and renal arteriography. P Renal or abdominal computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound indicate changes associated with chronic renal failure, including abnormally small size in both kidneys. Kidney biopsy allows histologic identification of the underlying pathology. Treatment Treatment focuses on controlling the symptoms, minimizing complications, and slowing the progression of the disease. Associated diseases that cause or result from chronic renal failure must be controlled such as hypertension. Conservative treatment aims to correct specific symptoms. A low-protein diet reduces the production of end products of protein metabolism that the kidneys can't excrete. (A patient receiving continuous peritoneal dialysis should have a high- protein diet.) A high-calorie diet prevents ketoacidosis and the negative nitrogen balance that results in catabolism and tissue atrophy,\\nand restricts sodium and potassium. Maintaining fluid balance requires careful monitoring of vital signs, weight changes, and urine volume (if present). If some renal function remains, administration of loop diuretics such as furosemide, and fluid restriction can reduce fluid retention. Cardiac glycosides may be used to mobilize edema fluids; antihypertensives, to control blood pressure and associated edema. Antiemetics taken before meals may relieve nausea and vomiting; cimetidine or ranitidine may decrease gastric irritation. Methylcellulose or docusate can help prevent constipation. Treatment may also include regular stool analysis (guaiac\\ntest) to detect occult blood and, as needed, cleaning enemas to remove blood from the GI tract. Anemia necessitates iron and folate supplements; severe anemia requires infusion of fresh frozen packed cells or washed packed cells. However, transfusions relieve anemia only temporarily. Epoetin alpha (erythropoietin) increases RBC production. Drug therapy often relieves associated symptoms: an antipruritic, such as trimeprazine or diphenhydramine, for itching and aluminum hydroxide gel to lower serum phosphate levels. The patient may also benefit from supplementary vitamins (particularly B vitamins and vitamin D) and essential amino acids. ALERT Careful monitoring of serum potassium levels is necessary to detect hyperkalemia. Emergency treatment for severe hyperkalemia includes dialysis therapy and administration of 50% hypertonic glucose I.V., regular insulin, calcium gluconate I.V., sodium bicarbonate I.V., and cation exchange resins such\\nas sodium polystyrene sulfonate. ALERT Cardiac tamponade resulting from pericardial effusion may require emergency pericardial tap or surgery. Blood gas measurements may indicate acidosis; intensive dialysis and thoracentesis can relieve pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (particularly continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis) can help control most manifestations of end-stage renal disease; altering dialyzing bath fluids can correct fluid and electrolyte disturbances. But anemia, peripheral neuropathy, cardiopulmonary and GI complications, sexual dysfunction, and skeletal defects may persist. Maintenance dialysis itself may produce complications, such as protein wasting, refractory ascites, and dialysis\\ndementia. Kidney transplantation may eventually be the treatment of choice for some patients with end-stage renal disease. PEDIATRIC TIP Children require more dialysis in relation to their body weight than adults because their metabolic rates and, therefore, food intake, are higher. Special considerations Because chronic renal failure has such widespread clinical effects, it requires meticulous and carefully coordinated supportive care. Good skin care is important. Bathe the patient daily, using superfatted soaps, oatmeal baths, and skin lotion without alcohol to ease pruritus. Don't use glycerincontaining soaps because they'll cause skin drying. Give good perineal care, using mild soap and water. Pad the side rails to guard against ecchymoses. Turn the\\npatient often, and use a convoluted foam mattress to prevent skin breakdown. Provide good oral hygiene. Brush the patient's teeth often with a soft brush or sponge tip to reduce breath odor. Sugarless hard candy and mouthwash minimize bad taste in the mouth\\nand alleviate thirst. Offer small, palatable meals that are also\\nnutritious; try to provide favorite foods within dietary restrictions. Encourage intake of high- calorie foods. Instruct the outpatient to avoid\\nhigh-sodium foods and high-potassium foods. Encourage adherence to fluid and protein restrictions. To prevent constipation, stress the need\\nfor exercise and sufficient dietary bulk. Watch for hyperkalemia. Observe for cramping of the legs and abdomen, and diarrhea. As potassium levels rise, watch for muscle irritability and a weak pulse rate. Monitor the electrocardiogram for tall, peaked T waves, widening QRS segment, prolonged PR interval, and disappearance of P waves, indicating hyperkalemia. Assess hydration status carefully. Check for jugular vein distention, and auscultate the lungs for crackles. Measure daily intake and output carefully, including all drainage, emesis, diarrhea, and blood loss. Record daily weight, presence or absence of thirst, axillary sweat, dryness of tongue, hypertension, and peripheral edema. Monitor for bone or joint complications. Prevent pathologic fractures by turning the patient carefully and ensuring his safety. Provide passive range-of-motion exercises for the bedridden patient. Encourage deep breathing and coughing to prevent pulmonary congestion. Listen often for crackles, rhonchi, and decreased breath sounds. Be alert for clinical effects of pulmonary edema (dyspnea, restlessness, crackles). Administer diuretics and other medications, as ordered. P Maintain strict sterile technique. Use a micropore filter during I.V. therapy. Watch for signs of infection (listlessness, high fever, and leukocytosis). Urge the outpatient to avoid contact with infected persons during the cold and flu season. Carefully observe and document seizure activity. Infuse sodium bicarbonate for acidosis, and sedatives or anticonvulsants for seizures, as ordered. Pad the side rails and keep an\\noral airway and suction setup at bedside. Assess neurologic status periodically, and check for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs, indicators\\nof low serum calcium levels. Observe for signs of bleeding. Watch for prolonged bleeding at puncture sites and at the vascular access site used for hemodialysis. Monitor Hb levels and HCT, and check stool, urine, and vomitus for blood. Report signs of pericarditis, such as a pericardial friction rub and chest pain. ALERT Watch for the disappearance of friction rub, with a drop of 15 to 20 mm Hg in blood pressure during inspiration (paradoxical pulse)\\u2014an early sign of pericardial tamponade. Schedule medications carefully. Give iron before meals, aluminum hydroxide gels after meals, and antiemetics, as necessary, a half hour before meals. Administer antihypertensives at appropriate intervals. If the patient requires a rectal infusion of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for dangerously high potassium levels, apply an emollient to soothe the perianal area. Be sure the sodium polystyrene sulfonate enema is expelled; otherwise, it will cause constipation and won't lower potassium levels. Recommend antacid cookies\\nas an alternative to aluminum hydroxide gels needed to bind GI phosphate. If the patient requires dialysis: Prepare the patient by fully explaining the procedure. Be sure that he understands how to protect and care for the arteriovenous shunt, fistula, or other vascular access. Check the vascular access site per facility protocol or every 2 hours for patency and check the limb for adequate blood supply and intact nervous function\\n(temperature, pulse rate, capillary refill, and sensation). If a fistula is present, feel for a thrill and listen for a bruit. Use a gentle touch to avoid occluding the fistula. Report signs of possible clotting. Don't use the arm with the vascular access site to take blood pressure readings, draw blood, or give injections as these procedures may rupture the fistula or occlude blood flow. Withhold the 6 a.m. (or morning) dose of antihypertensive on the morning of dialysis, and instruct the outpatient\\nto do the same. Use standard precautions when handling body fluids and needles. Monitor Hb levels and HCT. Assess the patient's tolerance of his levels. Some individuals are more sensitive to lower levels than others. Instruct the anemic patient to conserve energy and to rest frequently. After dialysis, check for disequilibrium syndrome, a result of sudden correction of blood chemistry abnormalities. Symptoms range from a headache to seizures. Also, check for excessive bleeding from the dialysis site. Apply pressure dressing or absorbable gelatin sponge, as indicated. Monitor blood pressure carefully after dialysis. A patient undergoing dialysis is under a great deal of stress, as is his family. Refer them to appropriate counseling agencies for assistance in coping with chronic renal failure. LOWER URINARY TRACT DISORDERS Lower urinary tract infection Cystitis and urethritis, the two forms of lower urinary tract infection (UTI), are nearly 10 times more common in women than in men and affect about 10% to 20% of all women at least once. Lower UTI is\\nalso a prevalent bacterial disease in children, with girls again most commonly affected. In men and children, lower UTIs are frequently related to anatomic or physiologic abnormalities and therefore require extremely P close evaluation. UTIs often respond readily to treatment but recurrence and resistant bacterial flare-up during therapy are possible. PEDIATRIC TIP Have a work-up done on all children with proven UTI to exclude an abnormality of the urinary tract that would predispose them to renal damage. Causes and incidence Most lower UTIs result from ascending infection by a single, gram- negative, enteric bacterium, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, or Serratia. However, in a patient with neurogenic bladder, an indwelling catheter, or a fistula between the intestine and bladder, lower UTI may result from simultaneous infection with multiple pathogens. Infection can result from a breakdown in local defense mechanisms in the bladder that allow bacteria to invade the bladder mucosa and multiply. These bacteria\\ncan't be readily eliminated by normal micturition. Bacterial flare-up during treatment is generally caused by the pathogenic organism's resistance to the prescribed antimicrobial therapy. The presence of even a small number (less than 10,000/\\u00b5l) of bacteria in a midstream urine sample obtained during treatment casts doubt on the effectiveness of treatment. In 99% of patients, recurrent lower UTI results from reinfection by the same organism or from some new pathogen; in the remaining 1%, recurrence reflects persistent infection, usually from renal calculi, chronic bacterial prostatitis, or a structural anomaly that may become a source of infection. The high incidence of lower UTI among women may result from the shortness of the female urethra (1\\u00bc\\u2033 to 2\\u2033 [3 to 5 cm]), which predisposes women to infection caused by bacteria from the vagina, perineum, rectum, or a sexual partner. (See Preventing UTIs. )\\nMen are less vulnerable because their urethras are longer (7\\u00bc\\u2033 [18.4 cm]) and because prostatic fluid serves as an antibacterial shield. However, in men older than age 60, incidence rates match those of women.\\nIn both men and women, infection usually ascends from the urethra to the bladder. ELDER TIP As a person ages, the bladder muscles weaken, which may result in incomplete bladder emptying and chronic urine retention\\u2014factors that predispose the older person to bladder infections. Complications Chronic or recurrent UTI Complicated UTI Kidney infection Signs and symptoms Lower UTI usually produces urgency, frequency, dysuria, cramps or spasms of the bladder, itching, a feeling of warmth during urination, nocturia, and possibly urethral discharge in males. Inflammation of the bladder wall also causes hematuria and fever. Other common features include low back pain, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or tenderness over the bladder area, chills, and flank pain. ELDER TIP The most common initial symptoms of lower UTI in elderly patients are lethargy and a change in mental status. Diagnosis Characteristic clinical features and a microscopic urinalysis showing red blood cells and white blood cells greater than 10/high-power field suggest lower UTI. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS P A clean-catch midstream urine specimen revealing a bacterial count above 100,000/\\u00b5l confirms the diagnosis. Lower counts don't necessarily rule out infection, especially if the patient is voiding frequently because bacteria require\\n30 to 45 minutes to reproduce in urine. Careful midstream, clean-catch collection is preferred to catheterization, which can reinfect the bladder with urethral bacteria. Sensitivity testing determines the appropriate therapeutic antimicrobial. If patient history and physical examination warrant, a blood test or a stained smear of the discharge rules out venereal disease. Voiding cystoureterography or excretory urography may detect congenital anomalies that predispose the patient to recurrent UTIs. Treatment Appropriate antimicrobials are the treatment of choice for most initial lower UTIs. A course of antibiotic therapy lasting from 7 to 10 days is standard, but recent studies suggest that a single dose of an antibiotic or an antibiotic regimen of 3 to 5 days length may be sufficient to render the urine sterile. After 3 days of antibiotic therapy, urine culture should show no organisms. If the urine isn't sterile, bacterial resistance has probably occurred, making the use of a\\ndifferent antimicrobial necessary. Single-dose antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin or co-trimoxazole may be effective in females with acute noncomplicated UTI. A urine culture taken 1 to 2 weeks later indicates whether or not the infection has been eradicated. PREVENTION PREVENTING UTIs Following a few simple steps can help reduce the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI). Women in particular may benefit from these suggestions. Maintain hydration Suggest drinking plenty of liquids, especially water. Cranberry juice may have infection-fighting properties. Urinate promptly Tell the patient to urinate promptly when the urge arises; urination shouldn't be restricted for a long time after the urge\\nto void is felt. Maintain hygiene Wiping from front to back after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Also, after intercourse, the bladder should be emptied as soon as possible. Drinking a glass of water also helps flush bacteria. Avoid irritation Use of deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, should be avoided because they can irritate the urethra. Recurrent infections due to infected renal calculi, chronic prostatitis, or structural abnormality may necessitate surgery; prostatitis also requires long-term antibiotic therapy. In patients without these predisposing conditions, long-term, low-dosage antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice. PEDIATRIC TIP Fluoroquinolones aren't used for children because of possible adverse effects on developing cartilage. Special considerations The care plan should include careful patient teaching, supportive measures, and proper specimen collection. Explain the nature and purpose of antimicrobial therapy. Emphasize the importance of completing the prescribed course of therapy or, with long-term prophylaxis, of adhering\\nstrictly to the ordered dosage. Urge the patient to drink plenty of water (at least eight glasses a day). Stress the need to maintain a consistent fluid intake of about 2 P qt (2 L)/day. More or less than this amount may alter the effect of the prescribed antimicrobial. Fruit juices, especially cranberry juice, and oral doses of vitamin C may help\\nacidify the urine and enhance the action of the medication. Watch for GI disturbances from antimicrobial therapy. Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals, taken with milk or a\\nmeal, prevent such distress. If therapy includes phenazopyridine, warn the patient that this drug may turn urine red-orange. Suggest warm sitz baths for relief of perineal discomfort. If baths aren't effective, apply heat sparingly to the perineum but be careful not to burn the patient. Apply topical antiseptics, such as povidone- iodine ointment, on the urethral meatus as\\nnecessary. Collect all urine samples for culture and sensitivity testing carefully and promptly. Teach a woman how to clean the perineum properly and keep the labia separated during voiding. A noncontaminated midstream specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. To prevent recurrent lower UTIs, teach a woman to carefully wipe the perineum from front to back and to clean it thoroughly with soap and water after defecation. Advise an infection-prone woman to void immediately after sexual intercourse. Stress the need to drink plenty of fluids routinely and to avoid postponing urination. Recommend frequent comfort stops during long car trips. Also stress the need to completely empty the bladder. To prevent recurrent infections in men, urge prompt treatment of predisposing conditions such as chronic prostatitis. Have the patient use a commode rather than a bedpan to promote sitting up, which assists in emptying the bladder. Vesicoureteral reflux In vesicoureteral reflux, urine flows from the bladder back into the ureters and eventually into the renal pelvis or the parenchyma. Because the bladder empties poorly, urinary tract infection (UTI) may result, possibly leading to acute or chronic pyelonephritis with renal damage. Vesicoureteral reflux is most common during infancy in boys and during early childhood (ages 3 to 7) in girls. Primary vesicoureteral reflux that results from congenital anomalies is most prevalent in females and is rare in blacks. Up to 25% of asymptomatic siblings of children with diagnosed primary vesicoureteral reflux also show reflux. Causes and incidence In patients with vesicoureteral reflux, incompetence of the ureterovesical junction and shortening of intravesical ureteral musculature allow backflow of urine into the ureter when the bladder contracts during voiding. Incompetence may result from congenital anomalies of the ureters or bladder, including short or absent intravesical ureter, ureteral ectopia lateralis (greater-than-normal lateral placement of ureters), and gaping ureteral orifice; inadequate detrusor muscle buttress in the bladder, stemming from congenital paraureteral bladder diverticulum; acquired diverticulum (from outlet obstruction); flaccid neurogenic bladder; and high intravesical pressure from outlet obstruction or an unknown cause. Vesicoureteral reflux may also result from cystitis, with inflammation of the intravesical ureter, which causes edema and fixation of the intramural ureter and usually leads to reflux in persons with congenital ureteral or bladder anomalies or other predisposing conditions. Reflux nephropathy occurs in about 4 out of 1,000 asymptomatic people. However, in infants and children who experience UTIs, its prevalence approaches 40% to 50%. Reflux nephropathy may lead to chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Complications Recurrent UTI Chronic pyelonephritis Renal scarring Hypertension Signs and symptoms Vesicoureteral reflux typically manifests itself as the signs and symptoms of UTI: frequency, urgency, burning on urination, hematuria, foul- P smelling urine and, in infants, dark, concentrated urine. With upper urinary tract involvement, signs and symptoms usually include high fever, chills, flank pain, vomiting, and malaise. PEDIATRIC TIP In children, fever, nonspecific abdominal pain, and diarrhea may be the only clinical effects. Rarely, children with minimal symptoms remain undiagnosed until puberty or later, when they begin to exhibit clear signs of renal impairment (anemia, hypertension, and lethargy). Diagnosis Symptoms of UTI provide the first clues to diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. In infants, hematuria or strong-smelling urine may be the first indication; palpation may reveal a hard, thickened bladder (hard mass deep in the pelvis) if posterior urethral valves are causing an obstruction in male infants. Cystoscopy, with instillation of a solution containing methylene blue or indigo carmine dye, may confirm the diagnosis. After the bladder is emptied and refilled with clear sterile water, color-tinged efflux from either ureter positively confirms reflux. Other pertinent laboratory studies include the following: Clean-catch urinalysis shows a bacterial count greater than 100,000/ \\u00b5l. Microscopic examination may reveal white blood cells, red blood cells, and an increased urine pH in the presence of infection. Specific gravity less than 1.010 demonstrates inability to\\nconcentrate urine. Laboratory studies reveal elevated creatinine levels (more than 1.2 mg/dl) and elevated blood urea nitrogen\\nlevels (more than 18 mg/dl), indicating advanced renal dysfunction. Excretory urography may show dilated lower\\nureter, ureter visible for its entire length, hydronephrosis, calyceal distortion, and renal scarring. Voiding cystourethrography (either fluoroscopic or radionuclide) identifies and determines the degree of reflux and shows when reflux occurs. It may also pinpoint the causative anomaly. In this procedure, contrast material is instilled into the bladder, and X-rays are taken before, during, and after voiding. Nuclear\\ncystography and renal ultrasound may also be used to detect reflux. Abdominal computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the kidneys or abdomen shows hydronephrosis, reflux, a small kidney, or scarring. Catheterization of the bladder after the patient voids determines the amount of residual urine. Treatment The goal of treatment in a patient with vesicoureteral reflux is to prevent pyelonephritis and renal dysfunction with antibiotic therapy and, when necessary, vesicoureteral reimplantation. Appropriate surgical procedures create a normal valve effect at the junction by reimplanting the ureter into the bladder wall at a more oblique angle. Antimicrobial therapy is usually effective for reflux that's secondary to infection, reflux related to neurogenic bladder and,\\nin children, reflux related to a short intravesical ureter (which abates spontaneously with growth). Reflux related to infection generally\\nsubsides after the infection is cured. However, 80% of females with vesicoureteral reflux will have recurrent UTIs within a year. Recurrent infection requires long- term prophylactic antibiotic therapy and careful\\npatient follow-up (cystoscopy and excretory urography every 4 to 6 months) to track the degree of reflux. UTI that recurs despite adequate prophylactic antibiotic therapy necessitates vesicoureteral reimplantation or reconstructive repair. Bladder outlet obstruction in neurogenic bladder requires surgery only if renal dysfunction is present. After surgery, as after antibiotic therapy, close medical follow-up is necessary (excretory urography every 2 to 3 years and urinalysis once per month for 1 year), even if symptoms haven't recurred. Special considerations P Patient care includes education and postoperative support. To ensure complete emptying of the bladder, teach the patient with vesicoureteral reflux to double void (void once and then try to void again in a few minutes). Because his natural urge to urinate may be impaired, advise him to void every 2 to 3\\nhours whether or not he feels the urge. PEDIATRIC TIP Because the diagnostic tests may frighten the child, encourage one of his parents to stay with him during\\nall procedures. Explain the procedures to the parents and to the child,\\nif he's old enough to understand. If surgery is necessary, explain postoperative care: suprapubic catheter in the male, indwelling catheter\\nin the female; and, in both, one or two ureteral catheters or splints brought out of the bladder through a small abdominal incision. The suprapubic or indwelling catheter keeps the bladder empty and prevents pressure from stressing the surgical wound; ureteral catheters drain urine directly from the renal pelvis. After complicated reimplantations, all catheters remain in place for 7 to 10 days. Explain that the child will be able to move and walk with the catheters but must be very careful not to dislodge them. Postoperatively, closely monitor fluid intake and output. Give analgesics and antibiotics, as ordered. Make sure the catheters are patent and draining well. Maintain sterile technique during catheter care. Watch for fever, chills, and flank pain,\\nwhich suggest a blocked catheter. Before discharging the patient, stress the importance of close follow- up care and adequate fluid intake throughout childhood. Instruct parents to watch for and report recurring signs of UTI (painful, frequent, burning urination; foul-smelling urine). If the child is taking antimicrobial drugs, make sure his parents understand the importance of completing the\\nprescribed therapy or maintaining low-dose prophylaxis. Neurogenic bladder Neurogenic bladder (also known as neuromuscular dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, neurologic bladder dysfunction, and neuropathic bladder )\\nrefers to all types of bladder dysfunction caused by an interruption of\\nnormal bladder innervation. Subsequent complications include incontinence, residual urine retention, urinary infection, stone formation, and renal failure. A neurogenic bladder can be spastic (hypertonic, reflex, or automatic) or flaccid (hypotonic, atonic, nonreflex, or autonomous). Causes and incidence At one time, neurogenic bladder was thought to result primarily from spinal cord injury; now, it appears to stem from a host of underlying conditions: cerebral disorders, such as stroke, brain tumor (meningioma and glioma), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia, and incontinence caused by aging spinal cord disease or trauma, such as herniated vertebral disks, spina bifida, myelomeningocele, spinal stenosis (causing cord compression) or arachnoiditis (causing adhesions between the membranes covering the cord), cervical spondylosis, myelopathies from hereditary or nutritional deficiencies and, rarely, tabes dorsalis disorders of peripheral innervation, including autonomic neuropathies resulting from endocrine disturbances such as diabetes mellitus (most common) metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, porphyria, or uremia (infrequent) acute infectious diseases such as transverse myelitis heavy metal toxicity chronic alcoholism collagen diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis P distant effects of cancer such as primary oat cell carcinoma of the lung herpes zoster syphilis sacral agenesis. An upper motor neuron lesion (above S2 to S4) causes spastic neurogenic bladder, with spontaneous contractions of detrusor muscles, elevated intravesical voiding pressure, bladder wall hypertrophy with trabeculation, and urinary sphincter spasms. A lower motor neuron lesion (below S2 to S4) causes flaccid neurogenic bladder, with decreased intravesical pressure, increased bladder capacity and large residual urine retention, and poor detrusor contraction. Complications Calculus formation Incontinence Renal failure Residual urine retention UTI Signs and symptoms Neurogenic bladder produces a wide range of clinical effects, depending on the underlying cause and its effect on the structural integrity of the bladder. Usually, this disorder causes some degree of incontinence, changes in initiation or interruption of micturition, and the inability to empty the bladder completely. Other effects of neurogenic bladder include vesicoureteral reflux, deterioration or infection in the upper urinary tract, and hydroureteral nephrosis. Depending on the site and extent of the spinal cord lesion, spastic neurogenic bladder may produce involuntary or frequent scanty urination, without a feeling of bladder fullness, and possibly spontaneous spasms of the arms and legs. Anal sphincter tone may be increased. Tactile stimulation of the abdomen, thighs, or genitalia may precipitate voiding and spontaneous contractions of the arms and legs. With cord lesions in the upper thoracic (cervical) level, bladder distention can trigger hyperactive autonomic reflexes, resulting in severe hypertension, bradycardia, and headaches. Flaccid neurogenic bladder may be associated with overflow incontinence, diminished anal sphincter tone, and a greatly distended bladder (evident on percussion or palpation), but without the accompanying feeling of bladder fullness due to sensory impairment. Diagnosis The patient's history may include a condition or disorder\\nthat can cause neurogenic bladder, incontinence, and disruptions of micturition patterns. Voiding cystourethrography evaluates bladder neck function, vesicoureteral reflux, and continence. Urodynamic studies help evaluate how urine is stored in the bladder, how well the bladder empties, and the rate of movement of urine out of the bladder during voiding. These studies consist of four components: Urine flow study (uroflow) shows diminished or impaired urine flow. Cystometry evaluates bladder nerve supply,\\ndetrusor muscle tone, and intravesical pressures during bladder filling\\nand contraction. Urethral pressure profile determines urethral function with respect to the length of the urethra and the outlet pressure resistance. Sphincter electromyelography correlates the neuromuscular function of the external sphincter with bladder muscle\\nfunction during bladder filling and contraction. This evaluates how well the bladder and urinary sphincter muscles work together. Retrograde urethrography reveals the presence of strictures and diverticula. This test may not be performed on a routine basis. Treatment The goals of treatment are to maintain the integrity of the upper urinary tract, control infection, and prevent urinary incontinence through P evacuation of the bladder, drug therapy, surgery or, less commonly, neural blocks and electrical stimulation. Techniques of bladder evacuation include Cred\\u00e9's method, Valsalva's maneuver, and intermittent self-catheterization. Cred\\u00e9's method\\u2014 application of manual pressure over the lower abdomen\\u2014 promotes complete emptying of the bladder. After appropriate instruction, most patients can perform this maneuver themselves. Even when patients perform this maneuver properly, however, Cred\\u00e9's method isn't always successful and doesn't always eliminate the need for catheterization. Intermittent self-catheterization\\u2014more effective than either Cred\\u00e9's method or Valsalva's maneuver\\u2014has proved to be a major advance in the treatment of neurogenic bladder because it allows complete emptying of the bladder without the risks that an indwelling catheter poses. Generally, men can perform this procedure more easily than women, but women can learn self-catheterization with the help of a mirror. Intermittent self-catheterization, in conjunction with a bladder- retraining program, is especially useful for patients with flaccid neurogenic bladder. Drug therapy for neurogenic bladder may include bethanechol and phenoxybenzamine to facilitate bladder emptying and propantheline, methantheline, flavoxate, dicyclomine, and imipramine to facilitate urine storage. When conservative treatment fails, surgery may correct the structural impairment through transurethral resection of the bladder\\nneck, urethral dilatation, external sphincterotomy, or urinary diversion procedures. Implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter may be necessary if permanent incontinence follows surgery for neurogenic bladder. Special considerations Care for patients with neurogenic bladder varies according to the underlying cause and method of treatment. Explain all diagnostic tests clearly so the patient understands the procedure, time involved, and possible results. Assure the patient that the lengthy diagnostic process is necessary to identify the most effective treatment plan. After the treatment plan is chosen, explain it to the patient in detail. Use strict sterile technique during insertion of an indwelling catheter (a temporary measure to drain the incontinent patient's bladder). Don't interrupt the closed drainage system for any reason. Obtain urine specimens with a syringe and smallbore needle inserted through the aspirating port of the catheter itself (below the junction of the balloon instillation site). Irrigate in the same manner if ordered. Clean the catheter insertion site with soap and water at least twice a day. Don't allow the catheter to become encrusted. Use a sterile applicator to apply antibiotic ointment around the meatus after catheter care. Keep the drainage bag below the tubing, and don't raise the bag above the level of the bladder. Clamp the tubing, or empty the bag before transferring the patient to a wheelchair\\nor stretcher to prevent accidental urine reflux. If urine output is considerable, empty the bag more frequently than once every 8 hours because bacteria can multiply in standing urine and migrate up the catheter and into the bladder. Watch for signs of infection (fever, cloudy or foul-smelling urine). Encourage the patient to drink plenty of\\nfluids to prevent calculus formation and infection from urinary stasis.\\nTry to keep the patient as mobile as possible. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises if necessary. If urinary diversion procedure is to be performed, arrange for consultation with an enterostomal therapist, and coordinate the care plans. Before discharge, teach the patient and his family evacuation techniques as necessary (Cred\\u00e9's method, intermittent catheterization). Counsel him regarding sexual activities. Remember, the incontinent patient feels embarrassed and distressed. Provide emotional support. Congenital anomalies of the ureter, bladder, and urethra The most common congenital malformations of the ureter, bladder, and urethra include duplicated ureter, retrocaval ureter, ectopic orifice of the ureter, stricture or stenosis of the ureter, ureterocele, exstrophy of the bladder, congenital bladder diverticulum, hypospadias, and epispadias. Some of these abnormalities are obvious at birth; others aren't apparent and are recognized only after they produce\\nsymptoms. (See Congenital urologic anomalies .) Causes and incidence Congenital anomalies of the ureter, bladder, and urethra are among the most common birth defects, occurring in about 5% of all births. Their causes are unknown; diagnosis and treatment vary. Complications Calculi Hematuria Infections Special considerations PEDIATRIC TIP Because these anomalies aren't always obvious at birth, carefully evaluate the newborn's urogenital function. Document the amount and color of urine, voiding pattern, strength of stream, and any indications of infection, such as fever and urine odor. Tell parents to watch for these signs at home. In all children, watch for signs of obstruction, such as dribbling, oliguria or\\nanuria, abdominal mass, hypertension, fever, bacteriuria, or pyuria. Monitor renal function daily; record intake and output accurately. Follow strict sterile technique in handling cystostomy tubes or indwelling urinary catheters. P P 0 P Make sure that ureteral, suprapubic, or urethral catheters remain in place and don't become contaminated. Document the type, color, and amount of drainage.

Don't use heavy clamps on the umbilical cord, and avoid dressing or diapering the infant. Place the infant in an incubator, and direct a stream of saline mist onto the bladder to keep it moist. Use warm water and mild soap to keep the surrounding skin clean. Rinse well, and keep the area as dry as possible to prevent excoriation. Infant boys diagnosed with hypospadias and\\nepisiadias should not be circumcised because the foreskin can be used in the surgical repair. Provide reassurance and emotional support to the parents. When possible, allow them to participate in their child's care to promote normal bonding. As appropriate, suggest or arrange for genetic counseling. PROSTATE AND EPIDIDYMIS DISORDERS Prostatitis Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate gland, may be acute or chronic. Acute prostatitis most often results from gram-negative bacteria and is easy to recognize and treat. However, chronic prostatitis, the most common cause of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in males, is less easy to recognize. Causes and incidence About 80% of bacterial prostatitis cases result from infection by Escherichia coli; the rest are due to infection by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, or Staphylococcus. These organisms probably spread to the prostate by the bloodstream or from ascending urethral infection, invasion of rectal bacteria via lymphatics, reflux of infected bladder urine into the prostate ducts or, less commonly, infrequent or excessive sexual intercourse or such procedures as cystoscopy or catheterization. Chronic prostatitis usually results from bacterial invasion from the urethra. It's estimated that 2 of every 10,000 people who seek outpatient care do so because of prostatitis. As many as 35% of males older than age 50 have chronic prostatitis; about 50% of males will be diagnosed with prostatitis at some point in their lives. P 3 Complications UTI Prostatic abscess Pyelonephritis Epididymitis Signs and symptoms Acute prostatitis begins with fever, chills, low back pain, myalgia, perineal fullness, and arthralgia. Urination is frequent and urgent. Dysuria, nocturia, and urinary obstruction may also occur. The urine may appear cloudy. When palpated rectally, the prostate is tender, indurated, swollen, firm, and warm. Chronic bacterial prostatitis sometimes produces no symptoms but usually elicits the same urinary symptoms as the acute form\\nbut to a lesser degree. UTI is a common complication. Other possible signs include painful ejaculation, hemospermia, persistent urethral discharge, and sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis Characteristic rectal examination findings suggest prostatitis. In many cases, a urine culture can identify the causative infectious organism. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A firm diagnosis depends on a comparison of urine cultures of specimens obtained by the Meares and Stamey technique. This test requires four specimens: one collected when the patient starts voiding (voided bladder one); another midstream; another after the patient stops voiding and the physician massages the prostate to produce secretions (expressed prostate secretions; and a final voided specimen. A significant increase in colony count in the prostatic specimens confirms prostatitis. Treatment Systemic antibiotic therapy chosen according to the infecting organism is the treatment of choice for acute prostatitis. If sepsis is likely, I.V. antibiotics may be given until sensitivity test results are known. If test results and clinical response are favorable, parenteral therapy continues for 48 hours to 1 week, after which an oral\\nagent is substituted for 30 days. For infections caused by a sexually transmitted disease, injection of ceftriaxone followed by a 10-day course of doxycycline or floxacin is effective. Supportive therapy includes bed rest, adequate hydration,\\nand administration of analgesics, antipyretics, sitz baths, and stool softeners as necessary. Diet therapy includes avoiding substances that irritate the bladder, such as alcohol, caffeinated food and beverages, citrus juices, and hot or spicy foods. Increasing the intake of fluids (1,893 to 3,785 ml/day) encourages frequent urination that will help flush the bacteria from the bladder. In symptomatic chronic prostatitis,\\nregular massage of the prostate is most effective. Regular ejaculation may help promote drainage of prostatic secretions. Anticholinergics and analgesics may help relieve nonbacterial prostatis symptoms. If drug therapy is unsuccessful, treatment may include transurethral resection of the prostate, which requires removal of all infected tissue. However, this procedure usually isn't performed on young adults because it may cause retrograde ejaculation and sterility. Total prostatectomy is curative but may cause impotence and incontinence. Special considerations Patient care is primarily supportive. Ensure bed rest and adequate hydration. Provide stool softeners and administer sitz baths, as ordered. As needed, prepare to assist with suprapubic needle aspiration of the bladder or a suprapubic cystostomy. Emphasize the need for strict adherence to\\nthe prescribed drug regimen. Instruct the patient to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Have him report adverse drug reactions (rash, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and GI irritation). Epididymitis This infection of the epididymis, the testicle's cordlike\\nexcretory duct, is one of the most common infections of the male reproductive tract. It usually affects adults and is rare before puberty. Epididymitis may spread to the testicle itself, causing orchitis; bilateral epididymitis may cause sterility. (See Orchitis , page 424.) Causes and incidence Epididymitis is usually a complication of pyogenic bacterial infection of the urinary tract (urethritis or prostatitis). The pyogenic organisms, such as staphylococci, Escherichia coli, streptococci, Chlamydia trachomatis , and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ,\\nreach the epididymis through the lumen of the vas deferens. Rarely, epididymitis is secondary to a distant infection, such as pharyngitis or\\ntuberculosis, that spreads through the lymphatics or, less commonly, the bloodstream. Other causes include trauma, gonorrhea, syphilis, or a chlamydial infection. Trauma may reactivate a dormant infection or initiate a new one. Epididymitis may be a complication of prostatectomy and may also result from chemical irritation by extravasation of urine through the vas deferens. The incidence is about 600,000 cases per year,\\nwith the highest prevalence in young males ages 19 to 35. Complications Bilateral epididymitis can cause sterility Orchitis Signs and symptoms P The key symptoms are pain, extreme tenderness, and swelling in the groin and scrotum with erythema, high fever, malaise, and a characteristic waddle\\u2014an attempt to protect the groin and scrotum during walking. An acute hydrocele may also result from inflammation. ORCHITIS Orchitis, an infection of the testicles, is a serious complication of epididymitis. It may also result from mumps, which may lead to sterility. Orchitis may, rarely, result from other systemic infections, testicular torsion, or severe trauma. Its typical effects include unilateral or bilateral tenderness, sudden onset of pain, and swelling of the scrotum and testicles. The affected testicle may be red.\\nNausea and vomiting also occur. Sudden cessation of pain indicates testicular ischemia, which may result in permanent damage to one or both\\ntesticles. Treatment consists of immediate antibiotic therapy; in orchitis due to mumps, diethylstilbestrol may be given to relieve pain, swelling, and fever. Severe orchitis may require surgery to incise and drain the hydrocele and improve testicular circulation. Other treatment is similar to that for epididymitis. To prevent orchitis due to mumps, stress the need for prepubertal males to receive mumps vaccine (or gamma\\nglobulin injection after contracting mumps). Diagnosis Clinical features suggest epididymitis but diagnosis is actually made with the aid of laboratory tests: urinalysis: increased white blood cell (WBC) count indicates infection urine culture and sensitivity tests: may identify causative organism serum WBC count: more than 10,000/\\u00b5l in infection. ALERT Scrotal ultrasonography may help differentiate acute epididymitis from other conditions, such as testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Testicular scan (nuclear medicine scan) may be done to rule out torsion. In epididymitis, increased blood flow is also demonstrated. Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce pain and swelling and combat infection. Therapy must begin immediately, particularly in the patient with bilateral epididymitis because sterility is always a threat. During the acute phase, treatment consists of bed rest, scrotal elevation with towel rolls or adhesive strapping, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. An ice bag applied to the area may reduce swelling and relieve pain (heat is contraindicated because it may damage\\ngerminal cells, which are viable only at or below normal body temperature). When pain and swelling subside and allow walking, an athletic supporter may prevent pain. Occasionally, corticosteroids may be prescribed to help counteract inflammation but their use is controversial. ELDER TIP In the older patient undergoing open\\nprostatectomy, bilateral vasectomy may be necessary to prevent epididymitis as a postoperative complication; however, antibiotic therapy alone may prevent it. When epididymitis is refractory to antibiotic therapy, epididymectomy under local anesthetic is necessary. Special considerations Patient care includes support and monitoring for worsening of symptoms. Watch closely for abscess formation (localized, hot, red, tender area) or extension of infection into the testes. Closely monitor temperature, and ensure adequate fluid intake. P Because the patient is usually very uncomfortable, administer analgesics as necessary. During bed rest, check often for proper scrotum elevation. Before discharge, emphasize the importance\\nof completing the prescribed antibiotic therapy, even after symptoms subside. Educate the patient regarding preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, as appropriate. If the patient faces the possibility of sterility, suggest supportive counseling as necessary. Benign prostatic hyperplasia Although most men older than age 50 have some prostatic enlargement, in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as benign prostatic hypertrophy, the prostate gland enlarges sufficiently to compress the urethra and cause some overt urinary obstruction. Depending on the size of the enlarged prostate, the age and health of the patient, and the extent of obstruction, BPH is treated symptomatically or surgically. Causes and incidence Evidence suggests a link between BPH and hormonal activity. As men age, production of androgenic hormones decreases, causing an imbalance in androgen and estrogen levels, and high levels of dihydrotestosterone, the main prostatic intracellular androgen. Other causes include neoplasm, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, inflammation, and metabolic or nutritional disturbances. Whatever the cause, BPH begins with changes in periurethral glandular tissue. As the prostate enlarges, it may extend into the bladder and obstruct urinary outflow by compressing or distorting the prostatic urethra. BPH may also cause a pouch to form in the bladder that retains urine when the rest of the bladder empties. This retained urine may lead to calculus formation or cystitis. The likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age. A small amount of prostate enlargement is present in\\nmany men older than age 40 and more than 90% of men older than age 80. It's estimated that by 2006, 115 million men age 50 and older will develop BPH. Blacks, with an incidence of 224.3 cases per 100,000 people, are at the greatest risk, present with more advanced disease, and have a poorer diagnosis. Whites, by comparison, have an incidence of\\n150.3 cases per 100,000 people while Asians have an incidence of 82.2 cases per 100,000 people. Complications Urinary stasis Urinary tract infection (UTI) Calculi Bladder wall trabeculation Detrusor muscle hypertrophy Bladder diverticula and saccules Urethral stenosis Hydronephrosis Paradoxical incontinence Acute or chronic renal failure Acute postobstructive diuresis Signs and symptoms Clinical features of BPH depend on the extent of prostatic enlargement and the lobes affected. Characteristically, the condition starts with a group of symptoms known as prostatism :\\nreduced urine stream caliber and force, urinary hesitancy, and difficulty starting micturition (resulting in straining, feeling of incomplete voiding, and an interrupted stream). As the obstruction increases, it causes frequent urination with nocturia, dribbling, urine retention, incontinence, and possibly hematuria. Physical examination indicates a visible midline mass above the symphysis pubis that represents an incompletely emptied bladder; rectal palpation discloses an enlarged prostate. Examination may detect secondary anemia and, possibly, renal insufficiency secondary to obstruction. P As BPH worsens, complete urinary obstruction may follow infection or use of decongestants, tranquilizers, alcohol, anti-depressants, or anticholinergics. Complications include infection, renal insufficiency, hemorrhage, and shock. Diagnosis Clinical features and a rectal examination are usually sufficient for diagnosis. Other findings help to confirm it: Excretory urography may indicate urinary tract obstruction, hydronephrosis, calculi or tumors, and filling and emptying defects in the bladder. Elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction. Urinalysis and urine culture show hematuria, pyuria and, when the bacterial count exceeds 100,000/\\u00b5l, UTI. When symptoms are severe, a cystourethroscopy is definitive, but this test is performed only immediately before surgery to help determine the best procedure. It can show prostate enlargement, bladder wall changes, and a raised bladder. Treatment Conservative therapy includes prostate massages, sitz baths, fluid restriction for bladder distention, and antimicrobials for infection. If symptoms are mild, methods for relief may include avoiding\\nalcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner; urinating when the urge is first felt; avoiding over-the-counter cold and sinus medications that\\ncontain decongestants or antihistamines because they can increase BPH symptoms; keeping warm and exercising regularly because cold weather and\\nlack of physical activity may worsen symptoms; performing pelvic strengthening exercises (Kegel exercises); reducing stress because nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination. Some men have had success taking extracts of saw palmetto berries, an herb that has been used to ease prostate symptoms. Fat-soluble saw palmetto extract that has been standardized to contain 85% to 95% fatty acids and sterols is more effective. Regular ejaculation may help relieve prostatic congestion. Urine flow rates can be improved with alpha1-adrenergic blockers, which relieve bladder outlet obstruction by preventing contractions of the prostatic capsule and bladder neck. Finasteride lowers levels of hormones produced by the prostate, reduces the size of the prostate gland, increases urine flow rate, and decreases symptoms of\\nBPH. It may take 3 to 6 months before a significant improvement in symptoms occurs. Potential adverse effects related to finasteride include decreased sex drive and impotence. Surgery is the only effective therapy to relieve acute urine retention, hydronephrosis, severe hematuria, recurrent UTIs, and other intolerable symptoms. A transurethral resection may be performed if the prostate weighs less than 2 oz (56.7 g). In this procedure, a resectoscope removes tissue with a wire loop and electric current. In high-risk patients, continuous drainage with an indwelling urinary catheter alleviates urine retention. Transurethral needle ablation may be used to heat and destroy prostate tissue by radiofrequency; this helps spare surrounding tissue. The following procedures involve open surgical removal: suprapubic (transvesical) resection: most common and useful when prostatic enlargement remains within the bladder retropubic (extravesical) resection: allows direct visualization; potency and continence are usually maintained. Balloon dilatation of the prostate is still being investigated. Balloon dilatation or balloon urethroplasty involves passing a flexible balloon catheter through the urethra at the level of the prostate while being guided by fluoroscope. The balloon is inflated for a short time to distend the prostatic urethra. Special considerations Prepare the patient for diagnostic tests and surgery, as appropriate. P Monitor and record the patient's vital signs, intake and output, and daily weight. Watch closely for signs of postobstructive diuresis (such as increased urine output and hypotension), which may lead to serious dehydration, lowered blood volume, shock, electrolyte loss, and anuria. Administer antibiotics, as indicated, for UTI, urethral instrumentation, and cystoscopy. If urine retention is present, insert an indwelling urinary catheter (although this is usually difficult in a patient with BPH). If the catheter can't be passed transurethrally, assist with suprapubic cystostomy (under local anesthetic). Watch for rapid bladder decompression. After prostatic surgery: Maintain patient comfort, and watch for and prevent postoperative complications. Observe for immediate dangers of prostatic bleeding (shock and hemorrhage). Check the catheter often (every 15 minutes for the first 2 to 3 hours) for patency and urine color; check dressings for bleeding. Postoperatively, many urologists insert a three-way catheter and establish continuous bladder irrigation. Keep the\\ncatheter open at a rate sufficient to maintain returns that are clear and light pink. Watch for fluid overload from absorption of the irrigating fluid into systemic circulation. If a regular catheter is used, observe it closely. If drainage stops because of clots, irrigate the catheter, as indicated, usually with 80 to 100 ml of normal saline solution, while maintaining strict sterile technique. ALERT Watch for septic shock, the most serious complication of prostatic surgery, which may cause severe chills, sudden fever, tachycardia, hypotension, or other signs of shock. Start rapid infusion of antibiotics I.V. as indicated. Watch for pulmonary embolus, heart failure, and renal shutdown. Monitor vital signs, central venous pressure, and arterial pressure continuously. The patient may need intensive supportive care in the intensive care unit. Administer anticholinergics, as indicated, to relieve painful bladder spasms that often occur after transurethral resection. Provide patient comfort measures after an open procedure: suppositories (except after perineal prostatectomy), analgesic medication to control incisional pain, and frequent dressing changes. Continue infusing I.V. fluids until the patient can drink sufficient fluids (2 to 3 L/day) to maintain adequate hydration. Administer stool softeners and laxatives, as needed, to prevent straining. Don't check for fecal impaction because\\na rectal examination may precipitate bleeding. After the catheter is removed, the patient\\nmay experience frequency, dribbling, and occasional hematuria. Reassure\\nhim that he'll gradually regain urinary control. Reinforce prescribed limits on activity. Warn the patient against lifting, strenuous exercise, and long automobile rides because these increase the risk of bleeding. Also caution the patient to restrict sexual activity for at least several weeks after discharge from the hospital. Instruct the patient to follow the prescribed oral antibiotic drug regimen, and tell him the indications for using gentle laxatives. Urge him to seek medical care immediately if\\nhe can't void, he passes bloody urine, or he develops a fever. Selected references Chisholm-Burns, M.A., et al. Pharmacology Principles and Practice.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction The environment contains thousands of pathogenic microorganisms \\u2014 viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Ordinarily, we\\nprotect ourselves from infectious organisms and other harmful invaders through an elaborate network of safeguards \\u2014 the host defense system. Understanding how this system functions provides the framework for studying various immune disorders. Host defense system The host defense system includes physical and chemical barriers to infection, the inflammatory response, and the immune response. Physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, prevent invasion by most organisms. Those organisms that penetrate this first line of defense simultaneously trigger the inflammatory and immune responses. Both responses involve cells derived from a hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow. Chemical barriers include lysozymes (found in body secretions, such as tears, mucus, and saliva) and hydrochloric acid (found in the stomach). Lysozymes destroy bacteria by removing cell walls. Hydrochloric acid breaks down food and mucus that contains pathogens. The inflammatory response involves polymorphonuclear leukocytes, basophils, mast cells, platelets and, to some extent, monocytes and macrophages. The immune response primarily involves the interaction of\\nlymphocytes (T and B), macrophages, and macrophagelike cells and their products. These cells may be circulating or may be localized in the immune system's tissues and organs, including the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils. The thymus participates in the maturation of T lymphocytes (cell-mediated immunity); here these cells are \\u201ceducated\\u201d to differentiate \\u201cself\\u201d from \\u201cnonself.\\u201d In contrast, B lymphocytes (humoral immunity) mature in the bone marrow. The key humoral effector mechanism is the production of immunoglobulin by B cells and the subsequent activation of the complement cascade. The lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and intestinal lymphoid tissue help remove and destroy circulating antigens in the blood and lymph. Antigens An antigen is any substance that can induce an immune response. T and B lymphocytes have specific receptors that respond to specific antigen molecular shapes (epitopes). In B cells, this receptor is an immunoglobulin (Ig) (antibody) cell: IgD or IgM, sometimes referred to as a surface immunoglobulin. The T-cell antigen receptor recognizes antigens only in association with specific cell surface molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). (See The major histocompatibility complex , page 430.)\\nMHC molecules, which differ among individuals, identify substances as self or nonself. Slightly different antigen receptors can recognize a phenomenal number of distinct antigens, which are coded by distinct, variable region genes. Groups, or clones, of lymphocytes exist with identical receptors for a specific antigen. The clone of a lymphocyte rapidly proliferates when exposed to the specific antigen. Some lymphocytes further differentiate, and others become memory cells, which allow a more rapid response \\u2014 the memory or anamnestic response \\u2014 to subsequent challenge by the antigen. Many factors influence antigenicity. Among them are the antigen's physical and chemical characteristics, its relative foreignness, and the individual's genetic makeup, particularly the MHC molecules. Most antigens are large molecules, such as proteins or polysaccharides. (Smaller molecules such as drugs that aren't antigenic by themselves are known as haptens. These haptens can bind with larger molecules, or P carriers, and become antigenic or immunogenic.) The antigen's relative foreignness influences the immune response's intensity. For example, little or no immune response may follow transfusion of serum proteins between humans; however, a vigorous immune\\nresponse (serum sickness) commonly follows transfusion of horse serum proteins to a human. Genetic makeup may also determine why some individuals respond to certain antigens, whereas others don't. The genes responsible for this phenomenon encode the MHC molecules. THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a cluster of genes on human chromosome 6 that plays a pivotal role in the immune response. Also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, these genes are inherited in an autosomal codominant manner. That is, each individual receives one set of MHC genes (haplotype) from each parent, and both sets of genes are expressed on the individual's cells. These genes play a role in the recognition of self versus nonself and the interaction of immunologically active cells by coding for cell-surface proteins. HLA antigens are divided into three classes. Class I antigens appear on nearly all of the body's cells and include HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C antigens. During tissue graft rejection, they're the chief antigens recognized by the host. When killer (CD8 + ) T cells use a virally infected antigen, they recognize it in the context of a class I antigen. Class II antigens only appear on B cells, macrophages, and activated T cells. They include the HLA-D and HLA-DR antigens. Class II antigens promote efficient collaboration between immunocompetent cells. Helper (CD4 + ) T cells require that antigen be presented in the context of a class II antigen. Because these antigens also determine whether an individual responds to a particular antigen, they're also known as immune response genes. Class III antigens include certain complement proteins (C2, C4, and Factor B). B lymphocytes B lymphocytes and their products, immunoglobulins, contribute to humoral immunity. The binding of soluble antigen with B-cell antigen receptors initiates the humoral immune response. The activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulins or antibodies. This response is regulated by T lymphocytes and their products, lymphokines. These lymphokines, which include interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and interferon (IFN) 8, are important in determining the class of immunoglobulins made by B cells. The immunoglobulins secreted by plasma cells are four-chain molecules with two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. (See Structure of the immunoglobulin molecule .)\\nEach chain has a variable (V) region and one or more constant (C) regions, which are coded by separate genes. The V regions of both L and H\\nchains participate in the binding of antigens. The C regions of the H chain provide a binding site for crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptors on cells and govern other mechanisms. Any clone of B cells has one antigen specificity determined by the V regions of its L and H chains. However, the clone can change the class of immunoglobulin that it makes by changing the association between its V region genes and H chain C region genes (a process known as isotype switching). For example, a clone of B cells genetically preprogrammed to recognize tetanus toxoid initially will make an IgM antibody against tetanus toxoid and later an IgG or other antibody against it. The five known classes of immunoglobulins \\u2014 IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD \\u2014 are distinguished by the constant portions of their H\\nchains. However, each class has a kappa or a lambda L chain, which gives rise to many subtypes. The almost limitless combinations of L and H\\nchains give immunoglobulins their specificity. IgG, the smallest immunoglobulin, appears in all body fluids because of its ability to move across membranes as a single structural unit (a P P monomer). It constitutes 75% of total serum immunoglobulins and is the major antibacterial and antiviral antibody. IgM, the largest immunoglobulin, appears as a pentamer (five monomers joined by a\\nJ-chain). Unlike IgG \\u2014 which is produced mainly in the secondary, or recall, response \\u2014 IgM dominates in the primary, or initial, immune response. However, like IgG, IgM is involved in classic antibody reactions, including precipitation, agglutination, neutralization, and complement fixation. Because of its size, IgM can't readily cross membrane barriers and is usually present only in the vascular system. IgM constitutes 5% of total serum immunoglobulins. IgA exists in serum primarily as a monomer; in secretory form, IgA exists almost exclusively as a dimer (two monomer molecules joined by a J-chain and a secretory component chain). As a secretory immunoglobulin, IgA defends external body surfaces and is present in colostrum, saliva, tears, nasal\\nfluids, and respiratory, GI, and genitourinary secretions. This antibody is considered important in preventing antigenic agents from attaching to epithelial surfaces. IgA makes up 20% of total serum immunoglobulins. IgE, present in trace amounts in serum, is involved in the release of vasoactive amines stored in basophils and tissue mast cell granules. When released,\\nthese bioamines cause the allergic effects characteristic of this type of hypersensitivity (erythema, itching, smooth-muscle contraction, secretions, and swelling). IgD, present as a monomer in serum in minute amounts, is the predominant antibody found on the surface of B lymphocytes and serves mainly as an antigen receptor. It may function in controlling lymphocyte activation or suppression. STRUCTURE OF THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN MOLECULE The immunoglobulin molecule consists of four polypeptide chains \\u2014 two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains \\u2014 held together by disulfide bonds. The H chain has one variable (V) and at least three constant (C) regions. The L chain has one V and one C region. Together, the V regions of the H and L chains form a pocket known as the antigen-binding site. This site is located within the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) region of the molecule. Part of the C region of the H chains forms the crystallizable fragment (Fc) region of the molecule. This region mediates effector mechanisms such as complement activation and is the portion of the immunoglobulin molecule bound by Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, mast cells, and basophils. Each immunoglobulin molecule also has two antibody- combining sites (except for the immunoglobulin [Ig] M molecule, which has 10, and IgA, which may have two or more). T lymphocytes T lymphocytes and macrophages are the chief participants in cell- mediated immunity. Immature T lymphocytes are derived from the bone marrow. Upon migration to the thymus, they undergo a maturation process that is dependent upon products of the MHC, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Thus, mature T cells can distinguish between self and nonself. T cells acquire certain surface molecules, or markers; these markers combined with the T-cell antigen receptor promote the particular activation of each type of T cell. T-cell activation requires presentation of antigens in the context of a specific HLA antigen. Helper T cells require class II HLA antigens; cytotoxic T cells require class I HLA antigens. T-cell activation also involves IL-1, produced by macrophages, and IL-2, produced by T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are a discrete population of large lymphocytes, some of which resemble T cells. NK cells recognize surface changes on body cells infected with a virus; they then bind to and, in many cases, kill the infected cells. Macrophages Important cells of the reticuloendothelial system, macrophages influence both immune and inflammatory responses. Macrophage precursors circulate in the blood. When they collect in various tissues and organs, they differentiate into macrophages with varying characteristics. Unlike B and T lymphocytes, macrophages lack surface receptors for specific antigens; instead, they have receptors for the C region of the H chain (Fc region) of immunoglobulin, for fragments of the third component of complement (C3), and for nonimmunologic factors such as carbohydrate molecules. One of the most important functions of macrophages is the\\npresentation of antigen to T lymphocytes. Macrophages ingest and process antigen, then deposit it on their own surfaces in association with HLA antigen. T lymphocytes become activated upon recognizing this complex. Macrophages also function in the inflammatory response by producing IL- 1, which generates fever. Additionally, macrophages synthesize complement proteins and other mediators that produce phagocytic, microbicidal, and tumoricidal effects. Cytokines Cytokines are low-molecular-weight proteins involved in communication between cells. Their purpose is to induce or regulate a variety of P immune or inflammatory responses. However, disorders may occur if cytokine production or regulation is impaired. Cytokines are categorized as follows: Colony-stimulating factors function primarily as hematopoietic growth factors, guiding the division and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. They also influence the functioning of mature lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages,\\nand neutrophils. Interferons act early to limit the spread of viral infections. They also inhibit tumor growth. Mainly, they determine how well tissue cells interact with\\ncytotoxic cells and lymphocytes. Interleukins are a large group of cytokines. (Those produced primarily by T lymphocytes are called lymphokines. Those produced by mononuclear phagocytes are called monokines.) They have a variety of effects, but most direct other cells to divide and differentiate. Tumor necrosis factors are believed to play a major role in mediating inflammation and cytotoxic reactions (along with IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8). Transforming growth factor demonstrates both inflammatory and anti- inflammatory effects. It's believed to be partially responsible for tissue fibrosis associated with\\nmany diseases. It demonstrates immunosuppressive effects on T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Complement system The chief humoral effector of the inflammatory response, the complement system consists of more than 20 serum proteins. When activated, these proteins interact in a cascadelike process that has profound biological effects. Complement activation takes place through one of two pathways. In the classical pathway, binding of IgM or IgG and antigen forms antigen-antibody complexes that activate the first complement component, C1. This, in turn, activates C4, C2, and C3. In the alternate pathway, activating surfaces such as bacterial membranes directly amplify spontaneous cleavage of C3. Once C3 is activated in either pathway, activation of the terminal components \\u2014 C5 to C9 \\u2014 follows. The major biological effects of complement activation include phagocyte attraction (chemotaxis) and activation, histamine release, viral neutralization, promotion of phagocytosis by opsonization, and lysis of cells and bacteria. Other mediators of inflammation derived from the kinin and coagulation pathways interact with the complement system. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes Besides macrophages and complement, other key participants in the inflammatory response are the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (also known as granulocytes ) \\u2014 neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Neutrophils , the most numerous of these cells, derive from bone marrow and increase dramatically in number in response to infection and inflammation. Highly\\nmobile cells, neutrophils are attracted to areas of inflammation (chemotaxis); in fact, they're the primary constituent of pus. Neutrophils have surface receptors for immunoglobulin and\\ncomplement fragments, and they avidly ingest opsonized particles such as bacteria. Ingested organisms are then promptly killed by toxic oxygen\\nmetabolites and enzymes such as lysozyme. Unfortunately, neutrophils not only kill invading organisms but may also damage host tissues. Also derived from bone marrow, eosinophils multiply in both allergic disorders and parasitic infestations. Although their phagocytic function isn't clearly understood, evidence suggests that they participate in host defense against parasites. Their products may also diminish the inflammatory response in allergic disorders. Two other types of cells that function in allergic disorders are basophils and mast cells. (Mast cells, however, aren't blood cells.) Basophils circulate in peripheral blood, whereas mast cells accumulate in connective tissue, particularly in the lungs, intestines,\\nand skin. Both types of cells have surface receptors for IgE. When crosslinked by an IgE- antigen complex, they release mediators characteristic of the allergic response. Immune disorders P Because of their complexity, the processes involved in host defense and immune response may malfunction. When the body's defenses are exaggerated, misdirected, or either absent or depressed, the result may be a hypersensitivity disorder, autoimmunity, or immunodeficiency, respectively. Some forms of immunodeficiency are iatrogenic (See Iatrogenic immunodeficiency, pages 434 and 435.) Hypersensitivity disorders An exaggerated or inappropriate immune response may lead to various hypersensitivity disorders. Such disorders are classified as type I through type IV, although some overlap exists. (See Classification of hypersensitivity reactions, pages 436 and 437.) TYPE I HYPERSENSITIVITY (ALLERGIC DISORDERS) In individuals with type I hypersensitivity, certain antigens (allergens) activate T cells. These, in turn, induce B-cell production of IgE, which binds to the Fc receptors on the surface of mast cells. When these cells are re-exposed to the same antigen, the antigen binds with the surface IgE, cross-links the Fc receptors, and causes mast cell degranulation with release of various mediators. (Degranulation may also be triggered by complement-derived anaphylatoxins\\u2014 C3a and C5a \\u2014 or by certain drugs such as morphine.) IATROGENIC IMMUNODEFICIENCY Iatrogenic immunodeficiency may be a complicating adverse\\neffect of chemotherapy or other treatments. At times, though, it's the goal of therapy\\u2014for example, to suppress immune-mediated tissue damage in autoimmune disorders or to prevent rejection of an organ transplant. As explained below, iatrogenic immunodeficiency may be induced by immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy, or splenectomy. Immunosuppressive drug therapy Immunosuppressive drugs fall into several categories: Cytotoxic drugs. These drugs kill immunocompetent cells while they're replicating. However, most cytotoxic drugs aren't selective and thus interfere with all rapidly proliferating cells. As a result, they reduce the number of lymphocytes as well as phagocytes. Besides depleting their number, cytotoxic drugs interfere with lymphocyte synthesis and release of immunoglobulins and lymphokines. Cyclophosphamide, a potent and commonly used immunosuppressant, initially depletes the number of B cells, suppressing\\nhumoral immunity. However, chronic therapy also depletes T cells, suppressing cell-mediated immunity as well. Cyclophosphamide may be used\\nin systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's granulomatosis, other systemic vasculitides, and in certain autoimmune disorders. Because it nonselectively destroys rapidly dividing cells, this drug can cause severe bone marrow suppression with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; gonadal suppression with sterility; alopecia; hemorrhagic cystitis; and nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. It may also increase the risk of lymphoproliferative neoplasms. Among other cytotoxic drugs used for immunosuppression are azathioprine (commonly used in kidney transplantation) and methotrexate (occasionally used in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders). If the patient is receiving cytotoxic drugs, monitor his white blood cell (WBC) count. If it falls too low, the drug dosage may need to be adjusted. Also monitor urine output and watch for signs of cystitis, especially if the patient is taking cyclophosphamide. Ensure adequate fluid intake (2 qt [about 2 L] daily). Give mesna as ordered to\\nhelp prevent hemorrhagic cystitis. Provide antiemetics to relieve nausea and vomiting as ordered. Give meticulous oral hygiene and report signs of stomatitis. Teach the patient about the early signs and symptoms of infection. If his WBC count falls too low, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be used to boost the count. Make sure the male patient understands the risk of sterility; advise sperm banking if appropriate. Young women may take hormonal contraceptives to minimize ovarian dysfunction and to prevent pregnancy during administration of these potentially teratogenic drugs. Corticosteroids. These adrenocortical hormones are used to treat immune-mediated disorders because of their potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Corticosteroids stabilize the vascular membrane, blocking tissue infiltration by neutrophils and monocytes, thus inhibiting inflammation. They also \\u201ckidnap\\u201d T cells in the bone marrow, causing lymphopenia. Because these drugs aren't cytotoxic, lymphocyte concentration can return to normal within 24 hours after they're withdrawn. Corticosteroids also appear to inhibit immunoglobulin synthesis and to interfere with the binding of immunoglobulin to antigen or to cells with crystallizable fragment receptors. These drugs have many other effects as well. The most commonly used oral corticosteroid is prednisone.\\nFor long-term therapy, prednisone is best given early in the morning to\\nminimize exogenous suppression P 5 of cortisol production and with food or milk to minimize gastric irritation. After the acute phase, it's usually reduced to an alternate-day schedule and then gradually withdrawn to minimize potentially harmful adverse effects. Other corticosteroids used for immunosuppression include hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. Chronic corticosteroid therapy can cause numerous adverse\\neffects, which are sometimes more harmful than the disease itself. Neurologic adverse effects include euphoria, insomnia, or psychosis; cardiovascular effects include hypertension and edema; and GI effects include gastric irritation, ulcers, and increased appetite with weight gain. Other possible effects are cataracts, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, delayed wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infection. During corticosteroid therapy, monitor the patient's blood pressure, weight, intake and output, and blood glucose. Instruct the patient to eat a well-balanced, low-salt diet or to follow the specially prescribed diet to prevent excessive weight gain. Remember that even though the patient is more susceptible to infection, he'll show fewer or less dramatic signs of inflammation. Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine selectively suppresses the proliferation and development of helper T cells, resulting in depressed cell-mediated immunity. This drug is used primarily to prevent rejection of kidney, liver, and heart transplants but is also being investigated for use in several other disorders. Significant toxic effects of cyclosporine primarily involve the liver and kidney, so treatment with this drug requires regular evaluation of renal and hepatic function. Adjusting the dose or the duration of therapy helps minimize certain adverse effects. Antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). This anti-T cell antibody reduces T-cell number and function, thus suppressing cell-mediated immunity. It has been used effectively to prevent cell-mediated rejection of tissue grafts or transplants. Usually, ATG is administered immediately before the transplant and continued for some time afterward. Potential adverse effects include anaphylaxis and serum sickness. Occurring 1 to 2 weeks after injection of ATG, serum sickness is characterized by fever, malaise, rash, arthralgias and, occasionally, glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. It presumably results from the deposition of immune complexes throughout the body. Radiation therapy Because irradiation is cytotoxic to proliferating and intermitotic cells, including most lymphocytes, radiation therapy may induce profound lymphopenia, resulting in immunosuppression. Irradiation\\nof all major lymph node areas \\u2014 a procedure known as total nodal irradiation \\u2014 is used to treat certain disorders such as Hodgkin's lymphoma. Its effectiveness in severe rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis, and the prevention of kidney transplant rejection is still under investigation. Splenectomy Splenectomy may be performed to manage various disorders,\\nincluding splenic injury or trauma, tumor, Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, Felty's syndrome Gaucher's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary spherocytosis and P hereditary elliptocytosis, thalassemia major, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. After splenectomy, the patient has increased susceptibility to infection. These patients should receive the pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent (Pneumovax) for prophylaxis and be warned to avoid exposure to infection and trauma. CLASSIFICATION OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS Type Cause Antibody or cell involved Pathophysiology Clinical examples I - Immediate hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis, atopy) Foreign protein (antigen) Immunoglobulin (Ig) E IgE attaches to the surface of the mast cell and specific antigen, triggers release of intracellular granules from mast cells Extrinsic asthma, allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, reactions to stinging insects, some food and drug reactions II - Cytotoxic hypersensitivity Foreign protein (antigen) IgG or IgM IgG or IgM reacts with antigen, activates complement, and causes cytolysis or phagocytosis Transfusion reaction, hemolytic drug reaction, Goodpasture's syndrome, hemolytic disease of the neonate III - Immune complex disease Foreign protein (antigen) Endogenous antigens IgG, IgM, IgA Antigen-antibody complexes precipitate in tissue, activate complement, and cause Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, serum sickness to some drugs or inflammatory reaction viral hepatitis antigen, glomerulonephritis IV - Delayed cell-mediated Foreign protein, cell, or tissue T lymphocytes Sensitized\\nT-cells react with specific antigen to induce inflammatory process by direct cell action or by activity of lymphokines Contact dermatitis, graft- versus-host disease, granulomatous diseases Some of these mediators are preformed, whereas others are\\nnewly synthesized upon activation of mast cells. Preformed mediators include heparin, histamine, proteolytic and other enzymes, and chemotactic factors for eosinophils and neutrophils. Newly synthesized mediators include prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Mast cells also produce a variety of cytokines. The effects of these mediators include smooth- muscle contraction, vasodilation, bronchospasm, edema, increased vascular permeability, mucus secretion, and cellular infiltration by eosinophils and neutrophils. Among classic associated signs and symptoms\\nare hypotension, wheezing, swelling, urticaria, and rhinorrhea. Examples of type I hypersensitivity disorders are anaphylaxis, atopy (an allergic reaction related to genetic predisposition), hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and, in some cases, asthma. TYPE II HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANTIBODY- DEPENDENT CYTOTOXICITY) In type II hypersensitivity, antibody is directed against\\ncell surface antigens. (Alternately, though, antibody may be directed against small molecules adsorbed to cells or against cell surface receptors rather than against cell constituents themselves.) Type II hypersensitivity then causes tissue damage through several mechanisms. Binding of antigen and antibody activates complement, which ultimately disrupts cellular membranes. P Another mechanism is mediated by various phagocytic cells\\nwith receptors for immunoglobulin (Fc region) and complement fragments. These cells envelop and destroy (phagocytose) opsonized targets, such as red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets. Antibody against these cells may be visualized by immunofluorescence. Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells also contribute to tissue damage in type II hypersensitivity. Examples of type II hypersensitivity include transfusion reactions, hemolytic disease of the neonate, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Goodpasture's syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. TYPE III HYPERSENSITIVITY (IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE) In type III hypersensitivity, excessive circulating antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) result in the deposition of these complexes in tissue \\u2014 most commonly in the kidneys, joints, skin, and blood vessels. (Normally, immune complexes are effectively cleared by the reticuloendothelial system.) These deposited immune complexes activate the complement cascade, resulting in local inflammation. They also trigger platelet release of vasoactive amines that increase vascular permeability, augmenting deposition of immune complexes in vessel walls. Type III hypersensitivity may be associated with infections, such as hepatitis B and bacterial endocarditis; certain cancers in which a serum sickness-like syndrome may occur; and autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. This hypersensitivity reaction may also follow drug or serum therapy. TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY (DELAYED HYPERSENSITIVITY) In type IV hypersensitivity, antigen is processed by macrophages and presented to T cells. The sensitized T cells then release lymphokines, which recruit and activate other lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The coagulation, kinin, and complement pathways also contribute to tissue damage in this type of reaction. Examples of type IV hypersensitivity include tuberculin reactions, contact hypersensitivity, and sarcoidosis. Autoimmune disorders Autoimmunity is characterized by a misdirected immune response in which the body's defenses become self-destructive. Autoimmune diseases aren't transmitted from one person to another, and the causes of autoimmunity aren't clearly understood. However, the process of autoimmunity is related to genes or a combination of genes, hormones, and environmental stimuli. Individuals with specific genes or gene combinations may be at a higher risk for developing autoimmune disorders, which may be triggered by outside stimuli, such as sun exposure, infection, drugs, or pregnancy. Recognition of self through the MHC is of primary importance in an immune response. However, how an immune response against self is prevented and which cells are primarily responsible isn't well understood. Many autoimmune disorders are characterized by B-cell hyperactivity, marked by proliferation of B cells and autoantibodies and\\nby hypergammaglobulinemia. B-cell hyperactivity is probably related to T- cell abnormalities, but the molecular basis of autoimmunity is poorly understood. Hormonal and genetic factors strongly influence the incidence of autoimmune disorders; for example, lupus erythematosus predominantly affects females of childbearing age, and certain HLA haplotypes are associated with an increased risk of specific autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune diseases may not follow a clear pattern of symptoms; therefore, a definitive diagnosis may be delayed. Diagnosis may rely on the patient's medical history; family history; physical examination, including signs and symptoms; and laboratory tests. Autoantibodies are usually found with such disorders as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, but confusion may occur because individuals with these disorders may have false negative results\\nto laboratory tests. P Treatment for autoimmune disorders focuses on relieving symptoms, preserving organ function, and providing medication that can target the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine. Autoimmune and immunological disorders are being researched. Web sites for the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) and other organizations offer substantial health care information relevant to both the patient and the physician. Immunodeficiency In immunodeficiency, the immune response is absent or depressed, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. This disorder may be primary or secondary. Primary immunodeficiency reflects a\\ndefect involving T cells, B cells, or lymphoid tissues. The National Primary Immunodeficiency Resource Center is a source of information on primary immunodeficiency syndromes. Secondary immunodeficiency results from an underlying disease or factor that depresses or blocks the immune response. The most\\ncommon forms of immunodeficiency are caused by viral infection (as in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). ALLERGY Asthma Asthma is a reversible lung disease characterized by obstruction or narrowing of the airways, which are typically inflamed and hyperresponsive to a variety of stimuli. It may resolve spontaneously or with treatment. Its symptoms range from mild wheezing and dyspnea to life-threatening respiratory failure. (See Determining asthma's severity .) Symptoms of bronchial airway obstruction may persist between acute episodes. Causes and incidence Asthma that results from sensitivity to specific external allergens is known as extrinsic. In cases in which the allergen isn't obvious, asthma is referred to as intrinsic. Allergens that cause extrinsic asthma include P pollen, animal dander, house dust or mold, kapok or feather pillows, food additives containing sulfites, and any other sensitizing substance. Extrinsic (atopic) asthma\\nusually begins in childhood and is accompanied by other manifestations of atopy (type I, immunoglobulin [Ig] E- mediated allergy), such as eczema and allergic rhinitis. In intrinsic (nonatopic) asthma, no extrinsic allergen can be identified. Most cases are preceded by a severe respiratory infection. Irritants, emotional stress, fatigue, exposure to noxious fumes as well as changes in endocrine, temperature, and humidity may aggravate intrinsic asthma attacks. In many asthmatics,\\nintrinsic and extrinsic asthma coexist. Several drugs and chemicals may provoke an asthma attack without using the IgE pathway. Apparently, they trigger release of mast-cell mediators by way of prostaglandin inhibition. Examples of these substances include aspirin, various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (such as indomethacin and mefenamic acid), and tartrazine, a yellow food dye. Exercise may also provoke an asthma attack. In exercise- induced asthma, bronchospasm may follow heat and moisture loss in the upper airways. The allergic response has two phases. When the patient inhales an allergenic substance, sensitized IgE antibodies trigger mast-cell degranulation in the lung interstitium, releasing histamine, cytokines, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and eosinophil chemotaxic factors. Histamine then attaches to receptor sites in the larger bronchi, causing irritation, inflammation, and edema. In the late\\nphase, inflammatory cells flow in. The influx of eosinophils provides additional inflammatory mediators and contributes to local injury. Although this common condition can strike at any age, half of all cases first occur in children younger than age 10; in this age-group, asthma affects twice as many males as females. In the United States, 14 million adults and 6 million children have asthma. Emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality from asthma have been\\nincreasing for more than 20 years, especially among children and blacks. DETERMINING ASTHMA'S SEVERITY Asthma is classified by severity using these features: frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms degree of airflow obstruction (spirometry measure) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) frequency of nighttime symptoms and the degree that the asthma interferes with daily activities. Severity can change over time, and even milder cases can become severe in an uncontrolled attack. Long-term therapy depends on whether the patient's asthma is classified as mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. For all patients,\\nquick relief can be obtained by using a short-acting bronchodilator (2 to 4 puffs of short-acting inhaled beta 2 - adrenergic agonists as needed for symptoms). However, the use of a short-acting bronchodilator more than twice a week in patients with intermittent asthma or daily or increasing use in patients with persistent asthma may indicate the need to initiate or increase long-term control therapy. Mild intermittent asthma The signs and symptoms of mild intermittent asthma include: daytime symptoms no more than twice a week nighttime symptoms no more than twice a month lung function testing (either PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second) is 80% of predicted value or higher PEF varies no more than 20%. Severe exacerbations, separated by long, symptomless periods of normal lung function, indicate mild intermittent asthma. A course of systemic corticosteroids is recommended for these exacerbations; otherwise, daily medication isn't required. Mild persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of mild persistent asthma include: daytime symptoms 3 to 6 days a week nighttime symptoms 3 to 4 times a month lung function testing is 80% of predicted value or higher PEF varies between 20% and 30%. The preferred treatment for mild, persistent asthma is low-dose inhaled corticosteroids, but alternative treatments include cromolyn, leukotriene modifier, nedocromil, or sustained-release theophylline. Moderate persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of moderate persistent asthma include: daily daytime symptoms at least weekly nighttime symptoms lung function testing is 60% to 80% of predicted value PEF varies more than 30%. The preferred treatment for moderate persistent asthma is\\nlow- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with a long-acting\\ninhaled beta 2 -adrenergic agonist. Alternative treatments include increasing inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range or lowor medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids with either leukotriene modifier or theophylline. For recurring exacerbations, the preferred treatment is to increase inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range and add\\na long-acting inhaled beta 2 -adrenergic agonist. The alternative treatment is to increase inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range and add either leukotriene modifier or theophylline. P 0 Severe persistent asthma The signs and symptoms of severe persistent asthma include: continual daytime symptoms frequent nighttime symptoms lung function testing is 60% of predicted value or lower PEF varies more than 30%. The preferred treatment for severe, persistent asthma includes high-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting inhaled beta 2 -adrenergic agonists. Long-term administration of corticosteroid tablets or syrup (2 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 60 mg/day), may be used to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroid therapy. Complications Status asthmaticus Respiratory failure Signs and symptoms An asthma attack may begin dramatically, with simultaneous onset of many severe symptoms, or insidiously, with gradually increasing respiratory distress. It typically includes progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness or some combination of these signs or symptoms. During an acute attack, the cough sounds tight and dry. As the attack subsides, tenacious mucoid sputum is produced (except in young children, who don't expectorate). Characteristic wheezing may be accompanied by coarse rhonchi, but fine crackles aren't heard unless associated with a related complication. Between acute attacks, breath sounds may be normal. The intensity of breath sounds in symptomatic asthma is typically reduced. A prolonged phase of forced expiration is typical of airflow obstruction. Evidence of lung hyperinflation (use of accessory muscles, for example) is particularly common in children. Acute attacks may be accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. In severe attacks, the patient may be unable to speak more than a few words without pausing for breath. Cyanosis, confusion, and lethargy indicate the onset of respiratory failure. Diagnosis Laboratory studies in patients with asthma commonly show these abnormalities: Pulmonary function studies reveal signs of\\nairway obstruction (decreased peak expiratory flow rates and forced expiratory volume in 1 second), low-normal or decreased vital capacity, and increased total lung and residual capacity. However, pulmonary function studies may be normal between attacks. Pulse oximetry may reveal decreased arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis provides\\nthe best indications of an attack's severity. In acutely severe asthma,\\nthe partial pressure of arterial oxygen is less than 60 mm Hg, the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) is 40 mm Hg or more, and pH is usually decreased. Complete blood count with differential reveals increased eosinophil count. Chest X-rays may show hyperinflation with areas of focal atelectasis. Before initiating tests for asthma, rule out other causes\\nof airway obstruction and wheezing. In children, such causes include cystic fibrosis, tumors of the bronchi or mediastinum, and acute viral bronchitis; in adults, other causes include obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and epiglottitis. Treatment P Treatment of acute asthma aims to decrease bronchoconstriction, reduce bronchial airway edema, and increase pulmonary ventilation. After an acute episode, treatment focuses on avoiding or removing precipitating factors, such as environmental allergens or irritants. If asthma is known to be caused by a particular antigen, it may be treated by desensitizing the patient through a series of injections of limited amounts of the antigen. The aim is to curb the patient's immune response to the antigen. If asthma results from an infection, antibiotics are prescribed. Drug therapy is most effective when begun soon after the onset of signs and symptoms. For relief of symptoms in adults and children older than age 5, short-acting inhaled beta 2 -adrenergic\\nagonists for bronchodilation may be used, and a course of systemic corticosteroids may be needed. The goal of therapy is asthma control with minimal or no adverse effects from medication. Acute attacks that don't respond to self-treatment may require hospital care, beta 2 -adrenergic\\nagonists by inhalation or subcutaneous injection (in three doses over 60 to 90 minutes) and, possibly, oxygen for hypoxemia. If the patient responds poorly, systemic corticosteroids and, possibly, subcutaneous epinephrine may help. Beta 2 -adrenergic agonist inhalation continues hourly. I.V. aminophylline may be added to the regimen and I.V. fluid therapy is started. Patients who don't respond to this treatment, whose airways remain obstructed, and who have increasing respiratory difficulty are at risk for status asthmaticus and may require mechanical ventilation. Treatment of status asthmaticus consists of aggressive drug therapy with a beta 2 -adrenergic\\nagonist by nebulizer every 30 to 60 minutes, possibly supplemented with\\nsubcutaneous epinephrine, I.V. corticosteroids, I.V. aminophylline, oxygen administration, I.V. fluid therapy, and intubation and mechanical\\nventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure (PaCO 2 of 40 mm Hg or more). (See How status asthmaticus progresses , pages 442 and 443.) Special considerations During an acute attack, proceed as follows: First, assess the severity of asthma. Administer the prescribed treatments and assess the patient's response. Place the patient in high Fowler's position. Encourage pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing. Help him to relax. Administer prescribed humidified oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 L/minute to ease breathing and to increase SaO 2 . Later, adjust oxygen according to the patient's vital signs and ABG levels. Anticipate intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient fails to maintain adequate oxygenation. Monitor serum theophylline levels to ensure they're in the therapeutic range. Observe your patient for signs and symptoms of theophylline toxicity (vomiting, diarrhea, and headache), as well as for signs of subtherapeutic dosage (respiratory distress and increased wheezing). Observe the frequency and severity of your\\npatient's cough, and note whether it's productive. Then auscultate his lungs, noting adventitious or absent breath sounds. If his cough isn't productive and rhonchi are present, teach him effective coughing techniques. If the patient can tolerate postural drainage and chest percussion, perform these procedures to clear secretions. Suction an intubated patient as needed. Treat dehydration with I.V. fluids until the patient can tolerate oral fluids, which will help loosen secretions. If conservative treatment fails to improve\\nthe airway obstruction, anticipate bronchoscopy or bronchial lavage when a lobe or larger area collapses. ALERT Monitor the patient's vital signs. Keep in mind that developing or increasing tachypnea may indicate worsening asthma or drug toxicity. Blood pressure readings may reveal pulsus paradoxus, indicating severe P asthma. Hypertension may indicate asthma-related hypoxemia. During long-term care, proceed as follows: Monitor the patient's respiratory status to detect baseline changes, to assess response to treatment, and to prevent or detect complications. Auscultate the lungs frequently, noting the degree of wheezing and quality of air movement. Review ABG levels, pulmonary function test results, and SaO 2 readings. If the patient is taking systemic corticosteroids, observe for complications, such as elevated blood glucose levels and friable skin and bruising. Cushingoid effects resulting from long-term use of corticosteroids may be minimized by alternate-day dosage or use of prescribed inhaled corticosteroids. If the patient is taking corticosteroids by inhaler, watch for signs of candidal infection in the mouth and pharynx. Using an extender device and rinsing the mouth afterward may prevent this. Observe the patient's anxiety level. Keep in mind that measures that reduce hypoxemia and breathlessness should help relieve anxiety. Keep the room temperature comfortable and use an air conditioner or a fan in hot, humid weather. Control exercise-induced asthma by instructing the patient to use a bronchodilator or cromolyn 30 minutes before exercise. Also instruct him to use pursed-lip breathing while exercising. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HOW STATUS ASTHMATICUS PROGRESSES A potentially fatal complication, status asthmaticus arises when impaired gas exchange and heightened airway resistance increase the work of breathing. This flow chart shows the stages of status asthmaticus. All patients should know the following: Teach the patient and his family to avoid known allergens and irritants. Describe to the patient prescribed drugs, including their names, dosages, actions, adverse effects, and special instructions. Teach the patient how to use a metereddose\\ninhaler. If he has difficulty using an inhaler, he may need an extender\\ndevice to optimize drug delivery and lower the risk of candidal infection with orally inhaled corticosteroids. If the patient has moderate to severe asthma, explain how to use a peak flow meter to measure the degree of airway obstruction. Tell him to keep a record of peak flow readings and to bring it to medical appointments. Explain the importance of calling the physician at once if the peak flow drops suddenly (may signal severe\\nrespiratory problems). Tell the patient to notify the physician if he develops a fever above 100\\u00b0 F (37.8\\u00b0 C), chest pain, shortness of breath without coughing or exercising, or uncontrollable coughing. An uncontrollable asthma attack requires immediate attention. Teach the patient diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing as well as effective coughing techniques. P Urge him to drink at least 3 qt (3 L) of fluids daily to help loosen secretions and maintain hydration. Allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis is a reaction to airborne (inhaled) allergens. Depending on the allergen, the resulting rhinitis and conjunctivitis may occur seasonally (hay fever) or year-round (perennial\\nallergic rhinitis). Causes and incidence Hay fever reflects an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated type\\nI hypersensitivity response to an environmental antigen (allergen) in a genetically susceptible individual. In most cases, it's induced by windborne pollens: in the spring by tree pollens (oak, elm, maple, alder, birch, and cottonwood), in the summer by grass pollens (sheep sorrel and English plantain), and in the fall by weed pollens (ragweed). Occasionally, hay fever is induced by allergy to fungal spores. In addition to individual sensitivity and geographical differences in plant\\npopulation, the amount of pollen in the air can be a factor in determining whether symptoms develop. Hot, dry, windy days have more pollen than cool, damp, rainy days. In perennial allergic rhinitis, inhaled allergens provoke\\nantigen responses that produce recurring symptoms year-round. The allergens trigger antibody production and histamine release, producing itching, swelling, and mucus. The major perennial allergens and irritants include dust mites, feather pillows, mold, cigarette smoke, upholstery, and animal dander. Seasonal pollen allergy may exacerbate signs and symptoms of perennial rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is the most common atopic allergic reaction, affecting more than 20 million Americans. It's most prevalent in young children and adolescents but can occur in all age groups. Complications Secondary sinus and middle ear infections Nasal polyps P Nasal obstruction Signs and symptoms In seasonal allergic rhinitis, the key signs and symptoms\\nare paroxysmal sneezing, profuse watery rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction or congestion, and pruritus of the nose and eyes. It's usually accompanied by pale, cyanotic, edematous nasal mucosa; red and edematous\\neyelids and conjunctivae; excessive lacrimation; and headache or sinus pain. Some patients also complain of itching in the throat and malaise. In perennial allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and other extranasal effects are rare, but chronic nasal obstruction is common. In\\nmany cases, this obstruction extends to eustachian tube obstruction, particularly in children. In both types of allergic rhinitis, dark circles may appear under the patient's eyes (\\u201callergic shiners\\u201d) because of venous congestion in the maxillary sinuses. The severity of signs and symptoms may vary from season to season and from year to year. Diagnosis Microscopic examination of sputum and nasal secretions reveals large numbers of eosinophils. Blood chemistry shows normal or elevated IgE. A definitive diagnosis is based on the patient's personal and family history of allergies as well as physical findings during a symptomatic phase. Skin testing paired with tested responses to environmental stimuli can pinpoint the responsible allergens given the patient's history. In patients who can't tolerate skin testing, the radioallergosorbent test may be helpful in determining specific allergen\\nsensitivity. To distinguish between allergic rhinitis and other nasal mucosa disorders, remember these differences: In chronic vasomotor rhinitis, eye symptoms are absent, rhinorrhea is mucoid, and seasonal variation is absent. In infectious rhinitis (the common cold), the nasal mucosa is beet red; nasal secretions contain polymorphonuclear, not eosinophilic, exudate; and signs and symptoms include fever and sore throat. This condition isn't a recurrent seasonal\\nphenomenon. In rhinitis medicamentosa, which results from excessive use of nasal sprays or drops, nasal drainage and mucosal redness and swelling disappear when such medication is withheld. PEDIATRIC TIP In children, differential diagnosis involves ruling out a nasal foreign body, such as a bean or a button. Treatment Treatment aims to control symptoms by eliminating the environmental antigen, if possible, and providing drug therapy and immunotherapy. Antihistamines block histamine effects but commonly produce anticholinergic adverse effects (sedation, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, and nervousness). Antihistamines, such as cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine, produce fewer adverse effects and are less likely to cause sedation. Inhaled intranasal steroids produce local anti-inflammatory effects with minimal systemic adverse effects. The most commonly used intranasal steroids are fluticasone, mometasone, and triamcinolone. These drugs are effective when symptoms aren't relieved by antihistamines alone. Advise the patient to use intranasal steroids regularly as prescribed for optimal effectiveness. Cromolyn may be helpful in treating hay fever, but this drug may take up to 4 weeks to produce a satisfactory effect and must be taken regularly during allergy season. Eye drop versions of cromolyn and antihistamines are available for itchy, bloodshot eyes. Long-term management includes immunotherapy, or desensitization with injections of extracted allergens, administered before or during allergy season or perennially. Seasonal allergies require particularly close dosage regulation. Special considerations P Before desensitization injections, assess the patient's symptom status. Afterward, watch for adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and severe localized erythema. ALERT Keep epinephrine and emergency resuscitation equipment available, and observe the patient for 30 minutes after the injection. Instruct the patient to call the physician if a delayed reaction should occur. The following protocol is recommended for allergic rhinitis: Monitor the patient's compliance with prescribed drug treatment regimens. Also carefully note any changes in the control of his symptoms or any signs of drug misuse. To reduce environmental exposure to airborne allergens, suggest that the patient sleep with the windows closed, avoid the countryside during pollination seasons, use air conditioning to filter allergens and minimize moisture and dust, and eliminate dust-collecting items, such as wool blankets, deep-pile carpets, and heavy drapes, from the home. In severe and resistant cases, suggest that the patient consider drastic changes in lifestyle such as relocation to a pollen-free area either seasonally or year-round. Be aware that some patients may develop chronic complications, including sinusitis and nasal polyps. Atopic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disorder that's characterized by superficial skin inflammation and intense itching. Although this disorder may appear at any age, it typically begins during\\ninfancy or early childhood. It may then subside spontaneously, followed\\nby exacerbations in late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Atopic dermatitis affects 2.5% of the population. Causes and incidence The cause of atopic dermatitis is still unknown. However,\\nseveral theories attempt to explain its pathogenesis. One theory suggests an underlying metabolically or biochemically induced skin disorder that's genetically linked to elevated serum immunoglobulin (Ig)\\nE levels. Another theory suggests defective T-cell function. Exacerbating factors of atopic dermatitis include irritants, infections (commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus ),\\nand some allergens. Although no reliable link exists between atopic dermatitis and exposure to inhalant allergens (such as house dust and animal dander), exposure to food allergens (such as soybeans, fish, or nuts) may coincide with flare-ups of atopic dermatitis. Complications Scarring Secondary infection Signs and symptoms Scratching the skin causes vasoconstriction and intensifies pruritus, resulting in erythematous, weeping lesions. Eventually, the lesions become scaly and lichenified. Usually, they're located in areas of flexion and extension, such as the neck, antecubital\\nfossa, popliteal folds, and behind the ears. Patients with atopic dermatitis are prone to unusually severe viral infections, bacterial and\\nfungal skin infections, ocular complications, and allergic contact dermatitis. Diagnosis Typically, the patient has a history of atopy, such as asthma, hay fever, or urticaria; his family may have a similar history. Laboratory tests reveal eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels. A skin biopsy may be performed, but it isn't always required to make the diagnosis. Treatment P Measures to ease this chronic disorder include meticulous\\nskin care, environmental control of offending allergens, and drug therapy. Because dry skin aggravates itching, frequent application of nonirritating topical lubricants is important, especially after bathing or showering. Minimizing exposure to allergens and irritants, such as wools and harsh detergents, also helps control symptoms. Drug therapy involves corticosteroids and antipruritics. Active dermatitis responds well to topical corticosteroids, which should\\nbe applied immediately after bathing for optimal penetration. Oral antihistamines are commonly used to help control itching. A bedtime dose\\nmay reduce involuntary scratching during sleep. If secondary infection develops, antibiotics are necessary. A newer treatment is the use of topical immunomodulators; these agents are steroid-free and have demonstrated an 80% success rate in studies. Special considerations Monitor the patient's compliance with drug therapy. Teach the patient when and how to apply topical corticosteroids. Emphasize the importance of regular personal hygiene using only water with little soap. Be alert for signs and symptoms of secondary infection; teach the patient how to recognize them as well. If the patient's diet is modified to exclude food allergens, monitor his nutritional status. Offer support to help the patient and his family cope with this chronic disorder. Discourage use of laundry additives. Dissuade the patient from scratching during urticaria to help prevent an infection. PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN LATEX Many medical and everyday items contain latex, which can be a threat to the patient with latex allergy. The most common items that contain latex are listed below. Medical products Adhesive bandages Airways, nasogastric tubes Blood pressure cuff, tubing, and bladder Catheters Catheter leg straps Dental dams Elastic bandages Electrode pads Fluid-circulating hypothermia blankets Handheld resuscitation bag Hemodialysis equipment I.V. catheters Latex or rubber gloves Medication vials Pads for crutches Protective sheets Reservoir breathing bags Rubber airway and endotracheal tubes Stethoscopes Tape Tourniquets Nonmedical products Adhesive tape Balloons (excluding Mylar) Cervical diaphragms Condoms Dishwashing gloves Disposable diapers Elastic stockings Glue Latex paint Nipples and pacifiers Racquet handles Rubber bands Tires Latex allergy Latex is a substance found in an increasing number of products both on the job and in the home environment. Also increasing is\\nthe number of latex allergies. Latex allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction to products that contain natural latex, which is derived from the sap of a rubber tree, not synthetic latex. These hypersensitivity reactions range from local dermatitis to a life-threatening anaphylactic\\nreaction. Causes and incidence About 1% of the population has a latex allergy. Anyone who is in frequent contact with latex-containing products is at risk for\\ndeveloping a latex allergy. (See Products that contain latex .)\\nThe more frequent the exposure, the higher the risk. The populations at\\nhighest risk are medical and dental professionals, workers in latex companies, and patients with spina bifida. Other individuals at risk include: patients with a history of asthma or other allergies, especially to bananas, avocados, tropical fruits, or chestnuts patients with a history of multiple intra-abdominal or genitourinary surgeries patients who require frequent intermittent urinary catheterization. P Complications Respiratory obstruction Systemic vascular collapse Signs and symptoms Early signs that a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction may be occurring include hypotension, tachycardia, and oxygen desaturation. Other clinical findings include urticaria, flushing, bronchospasm, difficulty breathing, pruritus, palpitations, abdominal pain, and syncope. Mild signs and symptoms may include itchy skin, swollen lips, nausea, diarrhea, and red, swollen, teary eyes. Diagnosis A patient who describes even the mildest symptoms during a\\nhistory and physical assessment should be suspected of having a latex allergy. The patient may describe dermatitis or mild respiratory distress when using latex gloves, inflating a balloon, or coming in contact with other latex products. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A blood test for latex sensitivity can confirm the diagnosis. This test, which measures specific immunoglobulin E antibodies against latex, should be used only when latex allergy is suspected; it isn't recommended as a screening tool. Treatment The best treatment of latex allergy is prevention; the more a latex- sensitive person is exposed to latex, the worse his symptoms will become. To avoid exposure, advise the patient to substitute products made of silicone and vinyl for those made of latex. When a latex allergy is suspected or known, the patient may receive medications before and after surgery or other invasive procedures. Premedications may include prednisone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine. Postmedications may include hydrocortisone, diphenhydramine,\\nand famotidine. There's no known treatment for an allergic reaction to latex. Care is supportive in nature. The patient's airway, breathing, and circulation must be monitored. An artificial airway, oxygen therapy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and fluid management may be necessary. During an acute reaction, epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone are commonly administered by I.V. infusion. Special considerations Urge the patient to wear an identification tag mentioning his latex allergy. Teach the patient and family members how to use an epinephrine autoinjector. Teach the patient to be aware of all latex-containing products and to use vinyl or silicone products instead.\\nAdvise him that Mylar balloons don't contain latex. PREVENTION Make sure that items that aren't available in a latex- free form, such as stethoscopes and blood pressure cuffs, are wrapped in cloth before they come in contact with a hypersensitive patient's skin. Place the patient in a private room or with another patient who requires a latex-free environment. When adding medication to an I.V. bag, inject the drug through the spike port, not the rubber latex port. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a dramatic, acute atopic reaction marked by the sudden onset of rapidly progressive urticaria and respiratory distress. A severe P reaction may precipitate vascular collapse, leading to systemic shock and, sometimes, death. Causes and incidence The source of anaphylactic reactions is ingestion of or other systemic exposure to sensitizing drugs or other substances. Such substances may include serums (usually horse serum), vaccines, allergen extracts, enzymes (L-asparaginase), hormones, penicillin and other antibiotics, sulfonamides, local anesthetics, salicylates, polysaccharides, diagnostic chemicals (sulfobromophthalein, sodium dehydrocholate, and radiographic contrast media), foods (especially legumes, nuts, berries, seafood, and egg albumin) and sulfite-containing\\nfood additives, insect venom (honeybees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, fire ants, mosquitoes, and certain spiders) and, rarely, ruptured hydatid cyst. A common cause of anaphylaxis is penicillin, which induces anaphylaxis in 1 to 4 of every 10,000 patients treated with it. Penicillin is most likely to induce anaphylaxis after parenteral administration or prolonged therapy and in atopic patients with an allergy to other drugs or foods. (See Preventing allergic response to penicillin , page 448.)\\nAn anaphylactic reaction requires previous sensitization or exposure to\\nthe specific antigen, resulting in the production of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies by plasma cells. This antibody production takes place in the lymph nodes and is enhanced by helper T cells. IgE antibodies then bind to membrane receptors on mast cells (found throughout connective tissue) and basophils. PREVENTION PREVENTING ALLERGIC RESPONSE TO PENICILLIN When administering penicillin or its derivatives, such as ampicillin or carbenicillin, follow these recommendations from the World Health Organization to prevent an allergic response: Have an emergency kit available to treat allergic reactions. Take a detailed patient history, including\\npenicillin allergy and other allergies. In an infant younger than age 3\\nmonths, check for penicillin allergy in the mother. Never give penicillin to a patient who has had an allergic reaction to it. Before giving penicillin to a patient with\\nsuspected penicillin allergy, refer the patient for skin and immunologic tests to confirm it. Always tell a patient he's going to receive penicillin before he takes the first dose. Observe the patient carefully for adverse effects for at least one half-hour after penicillin administration. Be aware that penicillin derivatives also may elicit an allergic reaction. On re-exposure, the antigen binds to adjacent IgE antibodies or cross- linked IgE receptors, activating a series of cellular reactions that trigger degranulation \\u2014 the release of powerful chemical mediators (such as histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, and plateletactivating factor) from mast cell stores. IgG or IgM enters into the reaction and activates the release of complement fractions. At the same time, two other chemical mediators, bradykinin and leukotrienes, induce vascular collapse by stimulating contraction of certain groups of smooth muscles and by increasing vascular permeability. In turn, increased vascular permeability leads to\\ndecreased peripheral resistance and plasma leakage from the circulation\\nto extravascular tissues (which lowers blood volume, causing hypotension, hypovolemic shock, and cardiac dysfunction). Complications Respiratory obstruction Systemic vascular collapse Death P Signs and symptoms An anaphylactic reaction produces sudden physical distress within seconds or minutes (although a delayed or persistent reaction may occur for up to 24 hours) after exposure to an allergen. The reaction's severity is inversely related to the interval between exposure to the allergen and the onset of symptoms. Usually, the first symptoms include a feeling of impending doom or fright, weakness, sweating, sneezing, shortness of breath, nasal pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema, followed rapidly by symptoms in one or more target organs. Cardiovascular symptoms include hypotension, shock and, sometimes, cardiac arrhythmias. If untreated, arrhythmia may precipitate circulatory collapse. Respiratory symptoms can occur at any level in the respiratory tract and commonly include nasal mucosal edema, profuse watery rhinorrhea, itching, nasal congestion, and sudden sneezing attacks. Edema of the upper respiratory tract results in hypopharyngeal and laryngeal obstruction (hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea). This is an early sign of acute respiratory failure, which can be fatal. GI and genitourinary symptoms include severe stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and urinary urgency and incontinence. Diagnosis Anaphylaxis can be diagnosed by the rapid onset of severe respiratory or cardiovascular signs and symptoms after ingestion or injection of a drug, vaccine, diagnostic agent, food, or food additive or after an insect sting. If these symptoms occur without a known allergic stimulus, rule out other possible causes of shock (acute myocardial infarction, status asthmaticus, or heart failure). Treatment Anaphylaxis is always an emergency. It requires an immediate injection of epinephrine 1:1,000 aqueous solution, 0.1 to 0.5 ml, repeated every 5 to 20 minutes as needed. In the early stages of anaphylaxis, when the patient hasn't lost consciousness and is normotensive, give epinephrine I.M. or subcutaneously and help it move into circulation faster by massaging the injection site. In severe reactions, when the patient has lost consciousness and is hypotensive, give epinephrine I.V. ALERT Maintain airway patency. Observe the\\npatient for early signs of laryngeal edema (hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea), which will probably require endotracheal tube insertion or a tracheotomy and oxygen therapy. In case of cardiac arrest, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including closedchest heart massage, assisted ventilation, and other therapies as indicated by clinical response. Watch for hypotension and shock, and maintain circulatory\\nvolume with volume expanders (plasma, plasma expanders, saline, and albumin) as needed. Stabilize blood pressure with the I.V. vasopressors norepinephrine and dopamine. Monitor blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output as a response index. After the initial emergency, administer other medications\\nas ordered: subcutaneous epinephrine, longer-acting epinephrine, corticosteroids, and I.V. diphenhydramine for long-term management and I.V. aminophylline over 10 to 20 minutes for bronchospasm. ALERT Rapid infusion of aminophylline may cause or aggravate severe hypotension. Special considerations PREVENTION Teach the patient to avoid exposure to known allergens. A person allergic to certain foods or\\ndrugs must learn to avoid the offending food or drug in all its forms. A\\nperson allergic to insect stings should avoid open fields and wooded areas during the insect season. P An anaphylaxis kit (epinephrine, antihistamine, and tourniquet) should also be carried whenever the patient with known severe allergic reactions goes outdoors. In addition,\\nevery patient prone to anaphylaxis should wear a medical identification\\nbracelet identifying his allergies. If a patient must receive a drug to which he's allergic, prevent a severe reaction by making sure he receives careful desensitization with gradually increasing doses of the antigen or advance administration of steroids. Of course, a person with a known allergic history should receive a drug with a high anaphylactic potential only after cautious pretesting for sensitivity. Closely monitor the patient during testing, and make sure you have resuscitative equipment and epinephrine ready. When any patient\\nneeds a drug with a high anaphylactic potential (particularly parenteral drugs), make sure he receives each dose under close medical observation. Closely monitor a patient undergoing diagnostic tests that use radiographic contrast media, such as excretory urography, cardiac catheterization, and angiography. Urticaria and angioedema Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is an episodic, usually self-limited skin reaction characterized by local dermal wheals surrounded by an erythematous flare. Angioedema is a subcutaneous and dermal eruption that produces deeper, larger wheals (usually on the hands, feet, lips, genitals, and eyelids) and a more diffuse swelling of\\nloose subcutaneous tissue. Urticaria and angioedema can occur simultaneously, but angioedema may last longer. HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA A nonallergenic type of angioedema, hereditary angioedema\\nresults from an autosomal dominant trait \\u2014 a hereditary deficiency of an alpha globulin, the normal inhibitor of C1 esterase (a component of the complement system). This deficiency allows uninhibited C1 esterase release, resulting in the vascular changes common to angioedema. The clinical effects of hereditary angioedema usually appear in childhood with recurrent episodes of subcutaneous or submucosal edema at irregular intervals of weeks, months, or years, in many cases after trauma or stress. Hereditary angioedema is unifocal, without urticarial pruritus, but associated with recurrent edema of the skin and mucosa (especially of the GI and respiratory tracts). GI tract involvement may cause nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Laryngeal angioedema may cause fatal airway obstruction. Treatment of acute hereditary angioedema may require androgens such as danazol. Tracheotomy may be necessary to relieve airway obstruction resulting from laryngeal angioedema. Causes and incidence Urticaria and angioedema are common allergic reactions that may occur in 20% of the general population. The causes of these reactions include allergy to drugs, foods, insect bites and stings and, occasionally, inhalant allergens (animal dander and cosmetics) that provoke an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated response to protein allergens.\\nHowever, certain drugs may cause urticaria without an IgE response. When urticaria and angioedema are part of an anaphylactic reaction, they almost always persist long after the systemic response has subsided. This occurs because circulation to the skin is the last to be restored after an allergic reaction, which results in slow histamine reabsorption\\nat the reaction site. P Nonallergic urticaria and angioedema are also related to histamine release. External physical stimuli, such as cold (usually in young adults), heat, water, or sunlight, may also provoke urticaria and angioedema. Dermographism urticaria, which develops after stroking or scratching of the skin, occurs in as much as 20% of the population. Such urticaria develops with varying pressure, usually under tight clothing, and is aggravated by scratching. Several different mechanisms and underlying disorders may\\nprovoke urticaria and angioedema. These include IgE-induced release of mediators from cutaneous mast cells; binding of IgG or IgM to antigen, resulting in complement activation; and such disorders as localized or secondary infections (such as respiratory infection), neoplastic diseases (such as Hodgkin's lymphoma), connective tissue diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), collagen vascular diseases, and psychogenic diseases. Complications Infection from scratching Laryngeal edema (upper respiratory tract involvement) Severe abdominal colic (GI involvement) Signs and symptoms The characteristic features of urticaria are distinct, raised, evanescent (temporary) dermal wheals surrounded by an erythematous flare. These lesions may vary in size. In cholinergic urticaria, the wheals may be tiny and blanched, surrounded by erythematous flares. Angioedema characteristically produces nonpitted swelling\\nof deep subcutaneous tissue, usually on the eyelids, lips, genitalia, and mucous membranes. These swellings don't usually itch but may burn and tingle. Diagnosis An accurate patient history can help determine the cause of urticaria. Such a history should include: drug history, including over-the-counter preparations (vitamins, aspirin, and antacids) frequently ingested foods (strawberries, milk products, fish) environmental influences (pets, carpet, clothing, soap, inhalants, cosmetics, hair dye, and insect bites and stings). Diagnosis also requires physical assessment to rule out similar conditions as well as a complete blood count, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a chest X-ray to rule out inflammatory infections. Skin testing, an elimination diet, and a food diary (recording time and amount of food eaten and circumstances) can pinpoint provoking allergens. The food diary may also suggest other allergies. For instance, a patient allergic to fish may also be allergic\\nto iodine contrast materials. Recurrent angioedema without urticaria, along with a familial history, points to hereditary angioedema. (See Hereditary angioedema .) Decreased serum levels of complement 4 and complement 1 esterase inhibitors confirm this diagnosis. Treatment Treatment aims to prevent or limit contact with triggering factors or, if this is impossible, to desensitize the patient\\nto them and to relieve symptoms. During desensitization, progressively larger doses of specific antigens (determined by skin testing) are injected intradermally. After the triggering stimulus has been removed, urticaria usually subsides in a few days \\u2014 except for drug reactions, which may persist as long as the drug is in the bloodstream. Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or another antihistamine can ease itching and swelling in every kind of urticaria. Corticosteroid\\ntherapy may be necessary for some patients. Special considerations Inform the patient receiving antihistamines of the possibility of drowsiness. Suggest cool compresses to reduce swelling\\nand pain. A cool bath may be used for large areas. Calamine lotion may be soothing as well. P Avoid hot baths, which can cause hives to return. Advise the patient to avoid tight-fitting clothing. Blood transfusion reaction Mediated by immune or nonimmune factors, a transfusion reaction accompanies or follows I.V. administration of blood components.\\nIts severity varies from mild (fever and chills) to severe (acute renal\\nfailure or complete vascular collapse and death), depending on the amount of blood transfused, the type of reaction, and the patient's general health. Causes and incidence Hemolytic reactions follow transfusion of mismatched blood. Transfusion of serologically incompatible blood triggers the most serious reaction, marked by intravascular agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs). The recipient's antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G or IgM) attach to the donated RBCs, leading to widespread clumping and destruction of the recipient's RBCs and, possibly, the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation\\n(DIC) and other serious effects. Transfusion of Rh-incompatible blood triggers a less serious reaction within several days to 2 weeks. Rh reactions are most common in females sensitized to RBC antigens by prior pregnancy or by unknown factors (such as bacterial or viral infection) and in people who\\nhave received more than five transfusions. (See Understanding the Rh system , page 452.) Allergic reactions are fairly\\ncommon but only occasionally serious. In this type of reaction, transfused soluble antigens react with surface IgE molecules on mast cells and basophils, causing degranulation and release of allergic mediators. Antibodies against IgA in an IgA-deficient recipient can also\\ntrigger a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Febrile nonhemolytic reactions, the most common type of reaction, apparently develop when cytotoxic or agglutinating antibodies in the recipient's plasma attack antigens on transfused lymphocytes, granulocytes, or plasma cells. UNDERSTANDING THE RH SYSTEM The Rh system contains more than 30 antibodies and antigens. Eighty-five percent of the world's population is Rh-positive, which means that the red blood cells of most people carry the D or Rh antigen. The remaining 15% of the population, who are Rh-negative, don't\\ncarry this antigen. When Rh-negative people receive Rh-positive blood for the\\nfirst time, they become sensitized to the D antigen but show no immediate reaction to it. If they receive Rh- positive blood a second time, they then develop a massive hemolytic reaction. For example, an Rh-negative mother who delivers an Rh-positive baby is sensitized by the\\nbaby's Rh-positive blood. During her next Rh-positive pregnancy, her sensitized blood would cause a hemolytic reaction in fetal circulation. Thus, the Rh-negative mother should receive Rh o (D) immune globulin (human) I.M. within 72 hours after delivering an Rh-positive baby to prevent formation of antibodies against Rh-positive blood. Although fairly uncommon, bacterial contamination of donor blood can occur during donor phlebotomy. Offending organisms are usually gram- negative, especially Pseudomonas species, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli. Contamination of donor blood with viruses, such as hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, and malaria, is also possible. Complications Bronchospasm Respiratory failure Acute tubular necrosis Acute renal failure Anaphylactic shock Vascular collapse Disseminated intravascular coagulation Signs and symptoms Immediate effects of a hemolytic transfusion reaction develop within a few minutes or hours after the start of the transfusion\\nand may include chills, fever, urticaria, tachycardia, dyspnea, nausea,\\nvomiting, tightness in the chest, chest and back pain, hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema, and signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, shock, pulmonary edema, heart failure, and renal failure. In a surgical patient\\nunder anesthesia, these symptoms are masked, but blood oozes from mucous membranes or the incision site. Delayed hemolytic reactions can occur up to several weeks\\nafter a transfusion, causing fever, an unexpected fall in serum hemoglobin (Hb) level, and jaundice. Allergic reactions are typically afebrile and characterized by urticaria and angioedema, possibly progressing to cough, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vascular instability, shock, and coma. The hallmark of febrile nonhemolytic reactions is mild to\\nsevere fever that may begin at the start of transfusion or within 2 hours after its completion. Bacterial contamination produces a high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and, possibly, shock. Symptoms of viral contamination may not appear for several weeks after transfusion. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirming a hemolytic transfusion reaction requires proof of blood incompatibility and evidence of hemolysis, such as hemoglobinuria, anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the serum, low serum Hb levels, and elevated bilirubin levels. P If you suspect such a reaction, have the patient's blood retyped and crossmatched with the donor's blood. After a hemolytic transfusion reaction, laboratory tests will show increased indirect bilirubin levels, decreased haptoglobin levels, increased serum Hb levels, and Hb in the urine. As the reaction progresses, tests may show signs of DIC (thrombocytopenia, increased prothrombin time, and decreased fibrinogen level) and acute tubular necrosis (increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels). A blood culture to isolate the causative organism should be done when bacterial contamination is suspected. Treatment At the first sign of a hemolytic reaction, stop the transfusion immediately. Depending on the nature of the patient's reaction, prepare to: monitor vital signs every 15 to 30 minutes, watching for signs of shock maintain a patent I.V. line with normal saline solution; insert an indwelling catheter and monitor intake and output cover the patient with blankets to ease chills, and explain what's happening deliver supplemental oxygen at low flow rates through a nasal cannula or bag-valvemask (handheld resuscitation bag) give drugs as ordered: an I.V. antihypotensive drug and normal saline solution to combat shock, epinephrine to treat dyspnea and wheezing, diphenhydramine to combat cellular histamine released from mast cells, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and mannitol or furosemide to maintain urinary function. Administer parenteral antihistamines and corticosteroids for allergic reactions. (Severe reactions such as anaphylaxis may require epinephrine.) Administer antipyretics for nonhemolytic febrile reactions\\nand appropriate I.V. antibiotics for bacterial contamination. Special considerations Remember to fully document the transfusion\\nreaction on the patient's chart, noting the transfusion's duration, the\\namount of blood absorbed, and a complete description of the reaction and of any interventions. PREVENTION Make sure you know your hospital's policy about giving blood before you give a transfusion. Then make sure you have the right blood and the right patient. Check and doublecheck the patient's name, hospital number, ABO blood group, and Rh status. If you find even a small discrepancy, don't give the blood. Notify the blood bank immediately and return the unopened unit. AUTOIMMUNITY Rheumatoid arthritis A chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding muscles, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. Spontaneous remissions and unpredictable exacerbations mark the course of this potentially crippling disease. RA usually requires lifelong treatment and, sometimes, surgery. In most patients, the disease follows an intermittent course and allows normal activity, although 10% suffer total disability from severe articular deformity, associated extra-articular symptoms, or both. The prognosis worsens with the development of nodules, vasculitis, and high titers of rheumatoid factor\\n(RF). Causes and incidence RA occurs worldwide, striking three times more females than males. Although it can occur at any age, it begins most often between ages 25 and 55. This disease affects more than 7 million people in the United States alone. What causes the chronic inflammation characteristic of RA\\nisn't known, but various theories point to infectious, genetic, and endocrine factors. P Currently, it's believed that a genetically susceptible individual develops abnormal or altered immunoglobulin (Ig) G\\nantibodies when exposed to an antigen. This altered IgG antibody isn't recognized as \\u201cself,\\u201d and the individual forms an antibody against it \\u2014 an antibody known as RF. By aggregating into complexes, RF generates inflammation. Eventually, cartilage damage by inflammation triggers additional immune responses, including activation of complement. This in\\nturn attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes and stimulates release of inflammatory mediators, which enhance joint destruction. Much more is known about the pathogenesis of RA than about its causes. If unarrested, the inflammatory process within the joints occurs in four stages. First, synovitis develops from congestion and edema of the synovial membrane and joint capsule. Formation of pannus \\u2014 thickened layers of granulation tissue \\u2014 marks the second stage's onset. Pannus covers and invades cartilage and eventually destroys the joint capsule and bone. Progression to the third stage is characterized by fibrous ankylosis \\u2014 fibrous invasion of the pannus and scar formation that occludes the joint space. Bone atrophy and malalignment cause visible deformities and disrupt the articulation of opposing bones, causing muscle atrophy and imbalance and, possibly, partial dislocations or subluxations. In the fourth stage, fibrous tissue calcifies, resulting in bony ankylosis and total immobility. Complications Fibrous or bony ankylosis Soft tissue contractures Joint deformities Subluxations Carpal tunnel syndrome Popliteal (Baker's) cysts Osteoporosis Vasculitis Amyloidosis Cardiac and pulmonary disorders Signs and symptoms RA usually develops insidiously and initially produces nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, persistent low-grade fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and vague articular symptoms. Later, more specific localized articular symptoms develop, commonly in the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. These symptoms usually occur bilaterally and symmetrically and may extend to the wrists, knees, elbows, and ankles. The affected joints stiffen after inactivity, especially upon rising in the morning. The fingers may assume a spindle shape from marked edema and joint congestion. The joints become tender and painful, at first only when the patient moves them, but eventually even at rest. They commonly feel hot to the touch. Ultimately, joint function is diminished. Deformities are common if active disease continues. Proximal interphalangeal joints may develop flexion deformities or become hyperextended. Metacarpophalangeal joints may swell dorsally, and volar subluxation and stretching of tendons may pull the fingers to the ulnar side (\\u201culnar drift\\u201d). The fingers may become fixed in a characteristic \\u201cswan's neck\\u201d appearance, or \\u201cboutonni\\u00e8re\\u201d deformity. The\\nhands appear foreshortened, the wrists boggy; carpal tunnel syndrome from synovial pressure on the median nerve causes tingling paresthesia in the fingers. The most common extra-articular finding is the gradual appearance of rheumatoid nodules \\u2014 subcutaneous, round or oval, nontender masses \\u2014 usually on pressure areas such as the elbows. Vasculitis can lead to skin lesions, leg ulcers, and multiple systemic complications. Peripheral neuropathy may produce numbness or tingling in\\nthe feet or weakness and loss of sensation in the fingers. Stiff, weak,\\nor painful muscles are common. Other common extra-articular effects include pericarditis, pulmonary nodules or fibrosis, pleuritis, scleritis, and episcleritis. Another complication is destruction of the odontoid process, part of the second cervical vertebra. Rarely, cord compression may occur, particularly in patients with long-standing deforming disease. Upper P motor neuron signs and symptoms, such as a positive Babinski's sign and muscle weakness, may also develop. RA can also cause temporomandibular joint disease, which impairs chewing and causes earaches. Other extra-articular findings may include infection, osteoporosis, myositis, cardiopulmonary lesions, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral neuritis. Diagnosis Typical clinical features suggest this disorder, but a definitive diagnosis is based on laboratory and other test results: X-rays \\u2014 in early stages, show bone demineralization and soft-tissue swelling; later, loss of cartilage and narrowing of joint spaces; finally, cartilage and bone destruction and erosion, subluxations, and deformities Rheumatoid factor test \\u2014 positive in 75% to 80% of patients as indicated by a titer of 1:160 or higher Synovial fluid analysis \\u2014 reveals increased volume and turbidity but decreased viscosity and complement (C3 and C4) levels; white blood cell count usually exceeds 10,000/\\u00b5l Erythrocyte sedimentation rate \\u2014 elevated in 85% to 90% of patients (may be useful to monitor response to therapy because elevation commonly parallels disease activity) Complete blood count \\u2014 usually reveals moderate anemia and slight leukocytosis. CLASSIFYING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS The criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology allow for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis. Guidelines A patient who meets four of the seven criteria is classified as having rheumatoid arthritis. He must experience the first four criteria for at least 6 weeks, and a physician must observe the second through fifth criteria. A patient with two or more other clinical diagnoses can also be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Criteria Morning stiffness in and around the joints that lasts for 1 hour before full improvement. Arthritis in three or more joint areas, with at least three joint areas (as observed by a physician) exhibiting soft tissue swelling or joint effusions, not just bony overgrowth (the 14 possible areas involved include the right and left proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, and metatarsophalangeal joints) Arthritis of hand joints, including the wrist, the metacarpophalangeal joint, or the proximal interphalangeal joint Arthritis that involves the same joint area on both sides of the body Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules over bony prominences Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method that produces a positive result in less\\nthan 5% of patients without rheumatoid arthritis Radiographic changes, usually on posterioanterior hand and wrist X-rays; these changes must show erosions\\nor unequivocal bony decalcification localized in or most notably adjacent to the involved joints. A C-reactive protein test can help monitor response to therapy. P The criteria for classifying rheumatoid arthritis developed by the American College of Rheumatology can also serve as guidelines for establishing a diagnosis. However, keep in mind that failure to meet these criteria\\u2014particularly early in the disease\\u2014 doesn't exclude the diagnosis. (See Classifying rheumatoid arthritis. ) Treatment Salicylates, particularly aspirin, are the mainstay of RA\\ntherapy because they decrease inflammation and relieve joint pain. Other useful medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin, fenoprofen, and ibuprofen), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine), gold salts, penicillamine, and corticosteroids (prednisone). Immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and azathioprine, are also therapeutic and are being used more commonly in early disease. (See Drug therapy for arthritis , pages 456 and 457.) Supportive measures include 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night, frequent rest periods between daily activities, and splinting to rest inflamed joints. A physical therapy program including range-of-motion exercises and carefully individualized therapeutic exercises forestalls joint function loss; application of heat relaxes muscles and relieves pain. Moist heat usually works best for patients with chronic disease. Ice packs are effective during acute episodes. DRUG THERAPY FOR ARTHRITIS Drug and adverse effects Clinical considerations Aspirin Prolonged\\nbleeding time; GI disturbances, including anorexia, nausea, dyspepsia, ulcers, and hemorrhage; hypersensitivity reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis; salicylism (mild toxicity: tinnitus, dizziness; moderate toxicity: restlessness, hyperpnea, delirium, marked lethargy; and severe toxicity: coma, seizures, severe hyperpnea) \\u25aa Don't use in patients with GI ulcers, bleeding, or hypersensitivity or in neonates. \\u25aa Tell the patient to take the drug with food, milk, antacid, or a large glass of water to reduce GI adverse effects. \\u25aa Monitor the patient's salicylate level. Remember that toxicity can develop rapidly in febrile, dehydrated children. \\u25aa Teach the patient to reduce the dose, one tablet at a time, if tinnitus occurs. \\u25aa Teach the patient to watch for signs of bleeding, such as bruising, melena, and petechiae. Fenoprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, sulindac, and tolmetin Prolonged\\nbleeding time; central nervous system abnormalities (headache, drowsiness, restlessness, dizziness, and tremor); GI disturbances, including hemorrhage and peptic ulcer; increased blood urea nitrogen and\\nliver enzyme levels \\u25aa Tell the patient taking NSAIDs that he may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke than those not taking NSAIDs. \\u25aa Don't use in patients with renal disease, in patients with asthma who have nasal polyps, or in children. \\u25aa Use cautiously in patients with GI and cardiac disease or if a patient is allergic to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \\u25aa Tell the patient to take the drug with milk or meals to reduce GI adverse effects. \\u25aa Tell the patient that the drug effect may be delayed for 2 to 3 weeks. \\u25aa Monitor the patient's kidney, liver, and auditory functions in long-term therapy. Stop the drug if abnormalities develop. \\u25aa Use cautiously in elderly patients; they may experience severe GI bleeding without warning. Hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine Blood dyscrasias, GI irritation, corneal opacities, and keratopathy or retinopathy \\u25aa Don't use in patients with retinal or visual field changes. \\u25aa Use cautiously in patients with hepatic disease, alcoholism, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or psoriasis. \\u25aa Perform complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests before therapy and during chronic therapy. The patient should also have regular ophthalmologic examinations. \\u25aa Tell the patient to take the drug with food or milk to minimize GI adverse effects. \\u25aa Warn the patient that dizziness may occur. Gold (oral and parenteral) Dermatitis, pruritus, rash, stomatitis, nephrotoxicity, blood dyscrasias and, with oral form, GI distress and diarrhea \\u25aa Watch for and report adverse effects. Observe for nitritoid reaction (flushing, fainting, and sweating). \\u25aa Check the patient's urine for blood and albumin before giving each dose. If positive, hold the drug and notify the physician. Stress to the\\npatient the need for regular follow-up, including blood and urine testing. \\u25aa To avoid local nerve irritation, mix the drug well and give it via a deep I.M. injection in the buttock. \\u25aa Advise the patient not to expect improvement for 3 to 6 months. \\u25aa Tell the patient to report rash, bruising, bleeding, hematuria, or oral ulcers. Methotrexate Tubular\\nnecrosis, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary interstitial infiltrates, hyperuricemia, stomatitis, rash, pruritus, dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, dizziness, cirrhosis, and hepatic fibrosis \\u25aa Don't give to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or to patients who are alcoholic. \\u25aa Monitor the patient's uric acid levels, CBC, and intake and output. \\u25aa Warn the patient to report any unusual bleeding (especially GI) or bruising promptly. \\u25aa Warn the patient to avoid alcohol, aspirin, and NSAIDs. \\u25aa Advise the patient to follow the prescribed regimen. Abatacept Headache,\\ndizziness, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, GI disturbances, including dyspepsia, nausea; UTI; back pain; respiratory system disturbances including upper respiratory infection, cough, exacerbation of COPD; skin\\nrash; infusionrelated hypersensitivity reactions, infections, malignancy \\u25aa\\nDon't give live vaccines during therapy and for 3 months following the end of treatment as it may decrease immune response to vaccine \\u25aa Use cautiously in patients with active infections, history or chronic infection, COPD or in women who are pregnant \\u25aa Patients who test positive for tuberculosis should be treated prior to using abatacept \\u25aa Contraindicated in patients taking a tumor necrosis antagonist (TNF) Note: Other drugs that may be used in resistant cases include prednisone, chloroquine, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. P P Advanced disease may require synovectomy, joint reconstruction, or total joint arthroplasty. Useful surgical procedures in RA include metatarsal head and distal ulnar resectional arthroplasty, insertion of a Silastic prosthesis between the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and arthrodesis (joint fusion). Arthrodesis sacrifices joint mobility for stability and pain relief. Synovectomy (removal of destructive, proliferating synovium, usually in the wrists, knees, and fingers) may halt or delay the course of this disease. Osteotomy (the cutting of bone or excision of a wedge of bone) can realign joint surfaces and redistribute stresses. Tendons may rupture spontaneously, requiring surgical repair. Tendon transfers may prevent deformities or relieve contractures. (See When arthritis requires surgery .) Special considerations Assess all joints carefully. Look for deformities, contractures, immobility, and inability to perform everyday activities. Monitor the patient's vital signs and note\\nweight changes, sensory disturbances, and level of pain. Administer analgesics as ordered and watch for adverse effects. Provide meticulous skin care. Check for rheumatoid nodules as well as pressure ulcers and breakdowns due to immobility, vascular impairment, corticosteroid treatment, or improper splinting. Use lotion or cleansing oil, not soap, for dry skin. Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures. Tell the patient to expect multiple blood samples to allow firm diagnosis and accurate monitoring of therapy. Monitor the duration, not the intensity, of morning stiffness because duration more accurately reflects the disease's severity. Encourage the patient to take hot showers or baths at bedtime or in the morning to reduce the need for pain medication. Apply splints carefully and correctly. Observe for pressure ulcers if the patient is in traction or wearing splints. Explain the nature of the disease. Make sure the patient and his family understand that RA is a chronic disease that requires major changes in lifestyle. Emphasize that there are no miracle cures, despite claims to the contrary. Encourage a balanced diet, but make sure the patient understands that special diets won't cure RA. Stress the need for weight control because obesity adds further stress to joints. Urge the patient to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), such as practicing good hygiene and dressing and feeding himself. Suggest ADL aids, such as a long-handled shoehorn; elastic shoelaces; zipper-pulls; button hooks; easy-to-handle cups, plates, and silverware; elevated toilet seats; and battery-operated toothbrushes. Household cleaning devices such as long-handled dustpans are also available. Patients who have trouble maneuvering fingers into gloves should wear mittens. ADLs that can be done in a sitting position should be encouraged. Allow the patient enough time to calmly perform these tasks. Provide emotional support. Remember that the patient with chronic illness easily becomes depressed, discouraged, and irritable. Encourage the patient to discuss his fears concerning dependency, sexuality, body image, and self-esteem. Refer him to an appropriate social service agency as needed. Discuss sexual aids: alternative positions, pain medication, and moist heat to increase mobility. Before discharge, make sure the patient knows how and when to take prescribed medication and how to recognize possible adverse effects. Teach the patient how to stand, walk, and sit correctly: upright and erect. Tell him to sit in chairs with high seats and armrests; he'll find it easier to get up from a chair if his knees are lower than his hips. If he doesn't own a chair with a high seat, recommend putting blocks of wood under a favorite chair's legs. Suggest an elevated toilet seat. Mobility aids are very helpful. Many medical and commercial stores offer assistive and supportive devices that promote self-care, P P including an overhead grasping trapeze to get out of bed, easy-to- open drawers, handheld shower nozzles, handrails, and grab bars. Instruct the patient to pace daily activities, resting for 5 to 10 minutes out of each hour and alternating\\nsitting and standing tasks. Adequate sleep and correct sleeping posture\\nare important. He should sleep on his back on a firm mattress and should avoid placing a pillow under his knees, which encourages flexion deformity. Teach the patient to avoid putting undue stress on joints and to use the largest joint available for a given task, to support weak or painful joints as much as possible, to avoid positions of flexion and promote positions of extension, to hold objects\\nparallel to the knuckles as briefly as possible, to always use his hands toward the center of his body, and to slide \\u2014 not lift \\u2014 objects whenever possible. Enlist the aid of the occupational therapist to teach how to simplify activities and protect arthritic joints. Stress the importance of shoes with proper support. Refer the patient to the Arthritis Foundation for more information on coping with the disease. WHEN ARTHRITIS REQUIRES SURGERY Arthritis severe enough to warrant total knee or total hip arthroplasty calls for comprehensive preoperative teaching and postoperative care. Before surgery Explain preoperative and surgical procedures. Show the patient the prosthesis to be used if available. Teach the patient postoperative exercises such as isometrics and supervise his practice. Also, teach deep- breathing and coughing exercises that will be necessary after surgery. Explain that total hip or knee arthroplasty requires frequent range-of-motion exercises of the leg after surgery; total knee arthroplasty requires frequent leg- lift exercises. Show the patient how to use a trapeze to move himself about in bed after surgery, and make sure he has a fracture bedpan handy. Tell the patient what kind of dressings to\\nexpect after surgery. After total knee arthroplasty, the patient's knee\\nmay be placed in a constant-passive-motion device to increase postoperative mobility and prevent emboli. After total hip arthroplasty,\\nhe'll have an abduction pillow between the legs to help keep the hip prosthesis in place. After surgery Closely monitor and record vital signs. Watch for complications, such as steroid crisis and shock in patients receiving steroids. Monitor distal leg pulses often, marking them with a\\nwater-proof marker to make them easier to find. As soon as the patient awakens, have him do active dorsiflexion; if he can't, report this immediately. Supervise isometric exercises every 2 hours. After total hip arthroplasty, check traction for pressure areas and keep the bed's head raised between 30 and 45 degrees. Change or reinforce dressings, as needed, using sterile technique. Check wounds for hematoma, excessive drainage, color changes, or foul odor \\u2014 all possible signs of hemorrhage or infection. (Wounds on rheumatoid arthritis patients may heal slowly.) Avoid contaminating dressings while helping the patient use the urinal or bedpan. Administer blood replacement products, antibiotics, and pain medication, as ordered. Monitor serum electrolyte and hemoglobin levels and hematocrit. Have the patient turn, cough, and deep-breathe every 2 hours; then percuss his chest. After total knee arthroplasty, keep the patient's leg extended and slightly elevated. After total hip arthroplasty, keep the patient's hip in abduction to prevent dislocation by using such measures\\nas a wedge pillow. Prevent external rotation and avoid hip flexion greater than 90 degrees. Watch for and immediately report any inability to rotate the hip or bear weight on it, increased pain, or a leg that appears shorter \\u2014 all may indicate dislocation. As soon as allowed, help the patient get out of bed and sit in a chair, keeping his weight on the unaffected side. When he's ready to walk, consult with the physical therapist for walking instruction and aids. ELDER TIP Reinforce safety precautions for elderly patients, such as the removal of throw rugs and the use of handrails and adequate night lighting. Recommend a step stool for elderly patients who need to reach in overhead cupboards. Suggest that the patient purchase medication without safety caps, if available, because these caps can be difficult to open. Medication administration should be designed to follow a standard regimen that fits with the patient's lifestyle. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Affecting children younger than age 16, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is an inflammatory disorder of the connective\\ntissues, characterized by joint swelling and pain or tenderness. It may\\nalso involve organs such as the skin, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and eyes, producing extra-articular signs and symptoms. JRA has three major types: systemic (Still's disease or acute febrile type), polyarticular, and pauciarticular. Depending on the\\ntype, this disease can occur as early as age 6 weeks \\u2014 although rarely before 6 months \\u2014 with peaks of onset at ages 1 to 3 and 8 to 12. The prognosis for JRA is generally good, although disabilities can occur. Long periods of spontaneous remission are common. Improvement or remission may occur at puberty. Causes and incidence The cause of JRA remains puzzling. Research continues to test several theories, such as those linking the disease to genetic factors or to an abnormal immune response. Viral or bacterial (particularly streptococcal) infection, trauma, and emotional stress may\\nbe precipitating factors, but their relationship to JRA remains unclear. Considered the major chronic rheumatic disorder of childhood, JRA affects an estimated 50 to 100 per 100,000 children in the United States; overall incidence is twice as high in females, with variation among the types of JRA. Complications Ocular damage Loss of vision Growth disturbances Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms vary with the type of JRA. Affecting boys and girls almost equally, systemic JRA accounts for about 10% of cases. The affected children may have mild, transient arthritis or frank polyarthritis with fever and rash. Joint involvement may not be evident at first, but the child's behavior may clearly suggest joint pain. Such a child may constantly want to sit in a\\nflexed position, may not walk much, or may P refuse to walk at all. Young\\nchildren with JRA are noticeably irritable and listless. Fever in systemic JRA occurs suddenly and spikes to 103\\u00b0 F\\n(39.4\\u00b0 C) or higher once or twice daily, usually in the late afternoon,\\nthen rapidly returns to normal or subnormal. (This \\u201csawtooth\\u201d or intermittent spiking fever pattern helps differentiate JRA from other inflammatory disorders.) When fever spikes, an evanescent rheumatoid rash commonly appears, consisting of small pale or salmon pink macules, usually on the trunk and proximal extremities and occasionally on the face, palms, and soles. Massaging or applying heat intensifies this rash. It's usually most conspicuous where the skin has been rubbed or subjected to pressure such as the areas of skin covered by underclothing. Other signs and symptoms of systemic JRA may include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, and nonspecific abdominal pain. Polyarticular JRA accounts for about 40% of cases and is three times more common in females than in\\nmales; affected children may be seronegative or seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF). It involves five or more joints and usually develops insidiously. Most commonly involved joints are the wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and small joints of the hands and feet. Polyarticular JRA can also affect larger joints, including the temporomandibular joints, cervical spine, hips, and shoulders. These joints become swollen, tender, and stiff. Usually, the arthritis is symmetrical; it may be remittent or indolent. The patient may run a low-grade fever with daily peaks. Listlessness and weight loss can occur, possibly with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Other signs\\nof polyarticular JRA include subcutaneous nodules on the elbows or heels and noticeable developmental retardation. Seropositive polyarticular JRA, the more severe type, usually occurs late in childhood and can cause destructive arthritis that mimics adult rheumatoid arthritis. Pauciarticular JRA involves few joints (usually no more than four), typically affecting the knees and other large joints. This form accounts for 50% of cases and has major subtypes. The first, pauciarticular JRA with chronic iridocyclitis, most commonly strikes females younger than age 6 and involves the knees, elbows, ankles, or iris. Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body is commonly asymptomatic but may produce pain, redness,\\nblurred vision, and photophobia. The second subtype, pauciarticular JRA with sacroiliitis,\\nusually strikes males (9:1) older than age 8, who tend to test positive\\nfor human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. This subtype is characterized by\\nlower extremity arthritis that produces hip, sacroiliac, heel, and foot\\npain as well as Achilles' tendinitis. These patients may later develop the sacroiliac and lumbar arthritis characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Some also experience acute iritis, but not as many as those\\nwith the first subtype. The third subtype includes patients with joint involvement who are antinuclear antibody (ANA) and HLA-B27 negative and don't develop iritis. These patients have a better prognosis than those with the first or second subtype. Common to all types of JRA is joint stiffness in the morning or after periods of inactivity. Back pain and limited range of motion is common. Growth disturbances may also occur, resulting in uneven length of arms or legs due to overgrowth or undergrowth adjacent to inflamed joints. Diagnosis Persistent joint pain and the rash and fever clearly point to JRA. Laboratory tests are useful for ruling out other inflammatory or even malignant diseases that can mimic JRA. Disease activity and response to therapy can also be monitored through laboratory results. Complete blood count shows decreased hemoglobin levels, neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, immunoglobulin, and C3 complement levels may be elevated. ANA test may be positive in patients who have pauciarticular JRA with chronic iridocyclitis. RF is present in 15% of JRA cases, compared with 85% of rheumatoid arthritis cases. P Positive HLA-B27 antigens may forecast later development of ankylosing spondylitis. X-rays in early stages reveal changes, including soft-tissue swelling, effusion, and periostitis in affected joints. Later, osteoporosis and accelerated bone growth may appear, followed by subchondral erosions, joint space narrowing, bone destruction, and fusion. Treatment Successful management of JRA usually involves administration of anti- inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, carefully planned nutrition and exercise, and regular eye examinations. Both child\\nand parents must be involved in therapy. Aspirin is the initial drug of choice, with dosage based on the child's weight. However, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used. If these prove ineffective, gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, and penicillamine may be tried. Because of adverse effects, steroids are generally reserved for treatment of systemic complications, such as pericarditis or iritis, that are resistant to NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and mydriatic drugs are commonly used for iridocyclitis. Low-dose cytotoxic drug therapy is currently being investigated. Physical therapy promotes regular exercise to maintain joint mobility and muscle strength, thereby preventing contractures, deformity, and disability. Good posture, gait training, and joint protection are also beneficial. Splints help reduce pain, prevent contractures, and maintain correct joint alignment. Surgery is usually limited to soft-tissue releases to improve joint mobility. Joint replacement is delayed until the child has\\nmatured physically and can handle vigorous rehabilitation. Special considerations Parents and health care professionals should encourage the child to be as independent as possible and to develop a positive attitude toward school, social development, and vocational planning. Regular slit-lamp examinations help ensure\\nearly diagnosis and treatment of iridocyclitis. Children with pauciarticular JRA with chronic iridocyclitis should be checked every 3 months during periods of active disease and every 6 months during remissions. Psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is a rheumatoid-like joint disease associated with psoriasis of nearby skin and nails. Although the arthritis component of this syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable\\nfrom rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatoid nodules are absent, and serologic tests for rheumatoid factor are negative. Psoriatic arthritis is usually mild, with intermittent flare-ups, but in rare cases may progress to crippling arthritis mutilans. This disease affects males and\\nfemales equally; onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 35. Causes and incidence Evidence suggests that predisposition to psoriatic arthritis is hereditary; 20% to 50% of patients are human leukocyte antigen-B27 positive. However, onset is usually precipitated by streptococcal infection or trauma. About 5% to 8% of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. It occurs in up to 1% of the general population. Signs and symptoms Psoriatic lesions usually precede the arthritic component; however, after the full syndrome is established, joint and skin lesions recur simultaneously. Arthritis may involve one joint or several joints symmetrically. Spinal involvement occurs in some patients. Peripheral joint involvement is most common in the distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, which have a characteristic sausage-like appearance. Nail changes include pitting, transverse ridges, onycholysis, keratosis, yellowing, and destruction. The patient may experience general malaise, fever, and eye involvement. Diagnosis P Inflammatory arthritis in a patient with psoriatic skin lesions suggests psoriatic arthritis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS X-rays confirm joint involvement and show: erosion of terminal phalangeal tufts \\u201cwhittling\\u201d of the distal end of the terminal phalanges \\u201cpencil-in-cup\\u201d deformity of the distal interphalangeal joints relative absence of osteoporosis sacroiliitis atypical spondylitis with syndesmophyte formation. Hyperostosis and paravertebral ossification result, which may lead to vertebral fusion. Blood studies indicate negative rheumatoid factor and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and uric acid levels. Treatment In mild psoriatic arthritis, treatment is supportive and consists of immobilization through bed rest or splints, isometric exercises, paraffin baths, heat therapy, and aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Some patients respond well to low-dose systemic corticosteroids; topical steroids may help control skin lesions. Gold salts and, most commonly, methotrexate therapy are effective in treating both the articular and cutaneous effects of psoriatic arthritis. Antimalarials are contraindicated because they can provoke exfoliative dermatitis. Special considerations Explain the disease and its treatment to the patient and his family. Encourage exercise, particularly swimming, to maintain strength and range of motion. Teach the patient how to apply skin care products and medications correctly; explain possible adverse effects. Stress the importance of adequate rest and protection of affected joints. Encourage regular, moderate exposure to the sun. Refer the patient to the Arthritis Foundation for self-help and support groups. Ankylosing spondylitis A chronic, usually progressive inflammatory disease, ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects the sacroiliac, apophyseal, and costovertebral joints, along with adjacent soft tissue. The disease (also known as rheumatoid spondylitis and Marie-Str\\u00fcmpell disease) usually begins in the sacroiliac joints and gradually progresses to the spine's lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions. Deterioration of bone and cartilage can lead to fibrous tissue formation with eventual fusion of the spine or peripheral joints. Ankylosing spondylitis may be equally prevalent in both sexes. Progressive disease is well recognized in men, but the diagnosis is commonly overlooked or missed in females, who tend to have more peripheral joint involvement. Causes and incidence Evidence strongly suggests a familial tendency in ankylosing spondylitis. The presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 (positive in more than 90% of patients with this disease) and circulating immune complexes suggests immunologic activity. One out of 10,000 people has ankylosing spondylitis. It affects more males than females and usually emerges between ages 20 and 40, although it may develop in children younger than age 10. Complication Atlantoaxial subluxation Signs and symptoms The first indication of ankylosing spondylitis is intermittent low back pain that's usually most severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Other signs and symptoms depend on the disease stage and may include: hip deformity and associated limited range of motion kyphosis in advanced stages, caused by chronic stooping to relieve symptoms mild fatigue, fever, anorexia, or weight loss; occasional iritis; aortic insufficiency and cardiomegaly; and upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis (mimics tuberculosis) pain and limited expansion of the chest due to involvement of the costovertebral joints peripheral arthritis involving shoulders, hips, and knees stiffness and limited motion of the lumbar spine tenderness over the inflammation site. These signs and symptoms progress unpredictably, and the disease can go into remission, exacerbation, or arrest at any stage. Diagnosis Typical symptoms, family history, and the presence of HLA-B27 strongly suggest ankylosing spondylitis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirmation requires these characteristic X-ray findings: blurring of the bony margins of joints in the early stage bilateral sacroiliac involvement patchy sclerosis with superficial bony erosions eventual squaring of vertebral bodies bamboo spine with complete ankylosis. P Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and alkaline phosphatase and serum immunoglobulin A levels may be elevated. A negative rheumatoid\\nfactor helps rule out rheumatoid arthritis, which produces similar symptoms. Treatment No treatment reliably stops progression of this disease, so management aims to delay further deformity through good posture, stretching and deep-breathing exercises and, in some patients, braces and light-weight supports. Anti-inflammatory analgesics, such as aspirin, indomethacin, sulfasalazine, and sulindac, control pain and inflammation. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been shown to improve symptoms. Corticosteroid therapy or medication to suppress the immune system may be prescribed to control various symptoms. Cytotoxic drugs that block cell growth have been used in patients who don't respond well to corticosteroids or those who are dependent on high doses\\nof corticosteroids. Severe hip involvement usually necessitates surgical hip replacement. Severe spinal involvement may require a spinal wedge osteotomy to separate and reposition the vertebrae. This surgery is performed only on selected patients because of the risk of spinal cord damage and the long convalescence involved. Special considerations Ankylosing spondylitis can be an extremely painful and crippling disease, so your main responsibility is to promote the patient's comfort. When dealing with such a patient, keep in mind that limited range of motion makes simple tasks difficult. Offer support and reassurance. Administer medications as ordered. Apply local heat and provide massage to relieve pain. Assess mobility and degree of discomfort frequently. Teach and assist with daily exercises as needed to maintain strength and function. Stress the importance of maintaining good posture. If treatment includes surgery, provide good postoperative care. Because ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressively crippling condition, a comprehensive treatment plan should\\nalso reflect counsel from a social worker, visiting nurse, and dietitian. To minimize deformities, advise the patient to: \\u2013 avoid any physical activity that places undue stress on the back such as lifting heavy objects \\u2013 stand upright; to sit upright in a high, straight chair; and to avoid leaning over a desk \\u2013 sleep in a prone position on a hard mattress and to avoid using pillows under neck or knees \\u2013 avoid prolonged walking, standing, sitting, or driving \\u2013 perform regular stretching and deep-breathing exercises and to swim regularly, if possible \\u2013 have height measured every 3 to 4 months to detect any tendency toward kyphosis \\u2013 seek vocational counseling if work requires standing or prolonged sitting at a desk \\u2013 contact the local Arthritis Foundation chapter for a support group. Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome The second most common autoimmune rheumatic disorder after rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome is characterized by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland secretion (sicca complex). Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome may be a primary disorder or it may be associated with connective tissue disorders, such as RA, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polymyositis. In some patients, the disorder is limited to the exocrine glands (glandular Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome); in others, it also involves other organs, such as the lungs and kidneys (extraglandular Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome). Causes and incidence P The cause of Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors probably contribute to its development. Viral or bacterial infection or perhaps exposure to pollen may trigger Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome in a genetically susceptible individual. Tissue damage results from infiltration by lymphocytes or from the deposition of immune complexes. Lymphocytic infiltration may be classified as benign, malignant, or pseudolymphoma (nonmalignant, but tumorlike aggregates of lymphoid cells). This syndrome occurs mainly in females (90% of patients); mean age of onset is 40 to 50 years of age. Complications Corneal ulceration Deafness Renal tubular necrosis Splenomegaly Signs and symptoms About 50% of patients with Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome have confirmed RA and a history of slowly developing sicca complex. However, some patients seek medical help for rapidly progressive and severe oral and ocular dryness, in many cases accompanied by periodic parotid gland enlargement. Ocular dryness (xerophthalmia) leads to foreign body sensation (gritty, sandy eye), redness, burning, photosensitivity, eye fatigue, itching, and mucoid discharge. The patient may also complain of\\na film across his field of vision. Oral dryness (xerostomia) leads to difficulty swallowing and talking; abnormal taste or smell sensation or both; thirst; ulcers of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and lips (especially at the corners of the\\nmouth); and severe dental caries. Dryness of the respiratory tract leads to epistaxis, hoarseness, chronic nonproductive cough, recurrent otitis media, and increased incidence of respiratory infections. Other effects may include dyspareunia and pruritus (associated with vaginal dryness), generalized itching, fatigue, recurrent low-grade fever, and arthralgia or myalgia. Lymph node enlargement may be the first sign of malignant lymphoma or pseudolymphoma. Specific extraglandular findings in Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome include interstitial pneumonitis; interstitial nephritis, which results in renal tubular acidosis in 25% of patients; Raynaud's phenomenon (20%); and vasculitis, usually limited to the skin and characterized by palpable purpura on the legs (20%). About 50% of patients show signs of hypothyroidism related to autoimmune thyroid disease. A few patients develop systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome rests on the detection of\\ntwo of the following three conditions: xerophthalmia, xerostomia (with salivary gland biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration), and an associated autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorder. Diagnosis must rule out other causes of oral and ocular dryness, including sarcoidosis,\\nendocrine disorders, anxiety or depression, and effects of therapy such\\nas radiation to the head and neck. More than 200 commonly used drugs also produce dry mouth as an adverse effect. In patients with salivary gland enlargement and severe lymphoid infiltration, diagnosis must rule out cancer. Laboratory values include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in most patients, mild anemia and leukopenia in 30%, and hypergammaglobulinemia in 50%. Autoantibodies are also common, including anti-Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome-A (anti-Ro) and anti-Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome-B (anti-La), which are antinuclear and antisalivary duct antibodies. From 75% to 90% of patients test positive for rheumatoid factor; 90%, for antinuclear antibodies. Other tests help support this diagnosis. Schirmer's tearing test and slit- lamp examination with rose bengal dye are used to measure eye involvement. Salivary gland involvement is evaluated by measuring the volume of parotid saliva and by secretory sialography and salivary scintigraphy. Lower-lip biopsy shows salivary gland infiltration by lymphocytes. P Treatment Treatment is usually symptomatic and includes conservative measures to relieve ocular or oral dryness. Mouth dryness can be relieved by using a methylcellulose swab or spray and by drinking\\nplenty of fluids, especially at mealtime. Meticulous oral hygiene is essential, including regular flossing, brushing, at-home fluoride treatment, and frequent dental checkups. Instill artificial tears as often as every half hour to prevent eye damage (corneal ulcerations and corneal opacifications) from\\ninsufficient tear secretions. Some patients may also benefit from instillation of an eye ointment at bedtime or from twicea-day use of sustained-release cellulose capsules (Lacrisert). If infection develops,\\nantibiotics should be given immediately; topical steroids should be avoided. Other treatment measures vary with associated extraglandular findings. Parotid gland enlargement requires local heat and analgesics. Pulmonary and renal interstitial disease necessitate corticosteroid use.\\nAccompanying lymphoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation. Special considerations Stress the need to humidify home and work environments to help relieve respiratory dryness. Advise the patient to avoid drugs that decrease saliva production, such as atropine derivatives, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and antidepressants. If mouth lesions make eating painful, suggest high-protein, high- calorie liquid supplements to prevent malnutrition. Advise the patient to avoid sugar, which contributes to dental caries. Tobacco; alcohol; and spicy, salty, or highly acidic foods, which cause mouth irritation, should also be avoided. Suggest normal saline solution drops or aerosolized spray for nasal dryness. Advise the patient to avoid prolonged hot showers and baths and to use moisturizing lotions to help ease dry skin.\\nSuggest K-Y lubricating jelly as a vaginal lubricant. Suggest the use of sunglasses to protect the patient's eyes from dust, wind, and strong light. Moisture chamber spectacles may also be helpful. Because dry eyes are more susceptible to\\ninfection, advise the patient to keep his face clean and to avoid rubbing his eyes. Refer the patient to the Sj\\u00f6gren's Syndrome Foundation for additional information and support. Lupus erythematosus A chronic inflammatory disorder of the connective tissues, lupus erythematosus appears in two forms. Discoid lupus erythematosus affects only the skin. (See Discoid lupus erythematosus .) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects multiple organ systems as well as the skin and can be fatal. Like rheumatoid arthritis, SLE is characterized by recurring remissions and exacerbations, especially common during the spring and summer. The prognosis improves with early detection and treatment, but remains poor for patients who develop cardiovascular, renal, or neurologic complications or severe bacterial infections. Causes and incidence The exact cause of SLE remains a mystery, but evidence points to interrelated immunologic, environmental, hormonal, and genetic factors. Autoimmunity is thought to be the prime causative mechanism. In autoimmunity, the body produces antibodies against its own cells such as the antinuclear antibody. The formed antigen-antibody complexes can suppress the body's normal immunity and damage tissues. Patients with SLE produce antibodies against many different tissue components, such as\\nred blood cells (RBCs), neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes, or almost any organ or tissue in the body. Certain predisposing factors may make a person susceptible to SLE. Physical or mental stress, streptococcal or viral infections, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light, immunization, pregnancy, and abnormal estrogen metabolism may all affect this disease's development. P SLE may also be triggered or aggravated by treatment with\\ncertain drugs \\u2014 for example, procainamide, hydralazine, anticonvulsants\\nand, less commonly, penicillins, sulfa drugs, and hormonal contraceptives. SLE strikes 9 times more women than men, increasing to 15\\ntimes more during childbearing years. It occurs worldwide but is most prevalent among Asians and Blacks. Complications Pleurisy Pleural effusions Pneumonitis Pulmonary hypertension Pericarditis Endocarditis Coronary atherosclerosis Renal failure DISCOID LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of lupus erythematosus marked by chronic skin eruptions that, if untreated, can lead to scarring and permanent disfigurement. About 1 of 20 patients with DLE later develops systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The exact cause of DLE is unknown, but some evidence suggests an autoimmune defect. An estimated 60% of patients with DLE are women in their late 20s or older. This disease is rare in children. DLE lesions are raised, red, scaling plaques, with follicular plugging and central atrophy. The raised edges and sunken centers give them a coinlike appearance. Although these lesions can appear anywhere on the body, they usually erupt on the face, scalp, ears, neck, and arms or on any part of the body that's exposed to sunlight. Such lesions can resolve completely or may cause hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, atrophy, and scarring. Facial plaques sometimes assume the butterfly pattern characteristic of SLE. Hair tends to become brittle or may fall out in patches. As a rule, patient history and the appearance of the rash itself are diagnostic. Lupus erythematosus cell test is positive in fewer than 10% of patients. Skin biopsy of lesions reveals immunoglobulins or complement components. SLE must be ruled out. Patients with DLE should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, fluorescent lighting, or reflected sunlight. They should wear protective clothing, use sunscreening agents, avoid engaging in outdoor activities during periods of most intense sunlight (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.), and report any changes in the lesions. Drug treatment consists of topical, intralesional, or systemic medication, as in SLE. Signs and symptoms The onset of SLE may be acute or insidious and produces no characteristic clinical pattern. However, its symptoms commonly include fever, weight loss, malaise, and fatigue as well as rashes and polyarthralgia. SLE may involve every organ system. In 90% of patients, joint involvement is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. Skin lesions are most commonly erythematous rashes in areas exposed to light.\\nThe classic butterfly rash over the nose and cheeks occurs in fewer than 50% of the patients. (See Butterfly rash , page 468.)\\nUltraviolet rays often provoke or aggravate skin eruptions. Vasculitis can develop (especially in the digits), possibly leading to infarctive lesions, necrotic leg ulcers, or digital gangrene. Raynaud's phenomenon appears in about 20% of P patients. Patchy alopecia and painless ulcers of\\nthe mucous membranes are common. Constitutional symptoms of SLE include aching, malaise, fatigue, low- grade or spiking fever, chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Lymph node enlargement (diffuse or local, and nontender), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation may occur. Females may experience irregular menstrual periods or amenorrhea during the active phase of SLE. About 50% of SLE patients develop signs of cardiopulmonary abnormalities, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, and dyspnea. Myocarditis, endocarditis, tachycardia, parenchymal infiltrates, and pneumonitis may occur. Renal effects may include hematuria, proteinuria, urine sediment, and cellular casts, which may progress to total kidney failure. Urinary tract infections may result from heightened susceptibility to infection. Seizure disorders and mental dysfunction may indicate neurologic damage. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement may produce emotional instability, psychosis, and organic mental syndrome. Headaches, irritability, and depression are common. (See Signs of systemic lupus erythematosus .) BUTTERFLY RASH In the classic butterfly rash, lesions appear on the cheeks and the bridge of the nose, creating a characteristic butterfly pattern. The rash may vary in severity from malar erythema to discoid lesions (plaque). Diagnosis Diagnostic tests for patients with SLE include a complete\\nblood count with differential (for signs of anemia and decreased white blood cell [WBC] count); platelet count (may be decreased); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (commonly elevated); and serum electrophoresis (may show hypergammaglobulinemia). Specific tests for SLE include: antinuclear antibody panel, including anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and anti-Smith antibodies \\u2014 generally positive for lupus alone. (Because the anti-DNA test is rarely positive in other conditions, it's the most specific test for SLE. However, if the patient is in remission, anti-DNA may be reduced or absent [correlates with disease activity, especially renal involvement, and helps monitor response to therapy]. Other tests may be performed as needed to rule out other disorders.) urine studies \\u2014 may show RBCs and WBCs, urine casts and sediment, and significant protein loss (more than 0.5 g/24 hours) blood studies \\u2014 decreased serum complement (C3 and C4) levels indicate active disease P chest X-ray \\u2014 may show pleurisy or lupus pneumonitis electrocardiogram \\u2014 may show conduction defect with cardiac involvement or pericarditis kidney biopsy \\u2014 determines disease stage and extent of renal involvement. Some patients show a positive lupus anticoagulant test and a positive anticardiolipin test. Such patients are prone to antiphospholipid syndrome (thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). Treatment Patients with mild disease require little or no medication. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, control arthritis symptoms in many patients. Skin lesions need topical treatment. Corticosteroid creams are recommended for acute lesions. Refractory skin lesions are treated with intralesional corticosteroids or antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine. Because hydroxychloroquine can cause retinal damage, such treatment requires ophthalmologic examination every 6 months. Corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for systemic symptoms of SLE, for acute generalized exacerbations, or for serious disease related to vital organ systems, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, and CNS involvement. Initial doses equivalent to 60 mg or more of prednisone often bring noticeable improvement within 48 hours. As soon as symptoms are under control, steroid dosage is tapered slowly. (Rising serum complement levels and decreasing anti-DNA titers indicate patient response.) Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, a major complication of SLE, requires treatment with large doses of steroids. If renal failure occurs, dialysis or kidney transplant may be necessary. In some patients, cytotoxic drugs may delay or prevent deteriorating renal status. Antihypertensive drugs and dietary changes may also be warranted in renal disease. The photosensitive patient should wear protective clothing (hat, sunglasses, long sleeves, and slacks) and use a screening\\nagent, with a sun protection factor of at least 15, when outdoors. Because SLE usually strikes females of childbearing age, questions about\\npregnancy commonly arise. Available evidence indicates that a woman with SLE can have a safe, successful pregnancy if she has no serious renal or neurologic impairment. Special considerations Careful assessment, supportive measures, emotional support, and patient education are all important parts of the care plan for patients with SLE. Watch for constitutional symptoms: joint pain or stiffness, weakness, fever, fatigue, and chills. Observe for dyspnea, chest pain, and any edema of the extremities. Note the size, type, and location of skin lesions. Check urine for hematuria, scalp for\\nhair loss, and skin and mucous membranes for petechiae, bleeding, ulceration, pallor, and bruising. Provide a balanced diet. Renal involvement may mandate a low- sodium, low-protein diet. Urge the patient to get plenty of rest. Schedule diagnostic tests and procedures to allow adequate rest. Explain\\nall tests and procedures. Tell the patient that several blood samples are needed initially, then periodically, to monitor progress. Apply heat packs to relieve joint pain and\\nstiffness. Encourage regular exercise to maintain full range of motion (ROM) and prevent contractures. Teach ROM exercises as well as body alignment and postural techniques. Arrange for physical therapy and occupational counseling as appropriate. Explain the expected benefit of prescribed\\nmedications. Watch for adverse effects, especially when the patient is taking high doses of corticosteroids. Advise the patient receiving cyclophosphamide to maintain adequate hydration. If prescribed, give mesna to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis and ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting. Monitor vital signs, intake and output, weight, and laboratory reports. Check pulse rates and observe for orthopnea. Check stools and GI secretions for blood. P Observe for hypertension, weight gain, and other signs of renal involvement. Assess for signs of neurologic damage: personality change, paranoid or psychotic behavior, ptosis, or diplopia.\\nTake seizure precautions. If Raynaud's phenomenon is present, warm and protect the patient's hands and feet. Offer cosmetic tips such as suggesting the\\nuse of hypoallergenic makeup and refer the patient to a hairdresser who\\nspecializes in scalp disorders. Advise the patient to purchase medications\\nin quantity, if possible. Warn against \\u201cmiracle\\u201d drugs for relief of arthritis symptoms. Refer the patient to the Lupus Foundation of America and the Arthritis Foundation as needed. SIGNS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS Diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is difficult because SLE commonly mimics other diseases; symptoms may be vague and vary greatly from patient to patient. The revised criteria for SLE must include four or more of the following signs: abnormal titer of antinuclear antibody hemolytic disorder malar rash discoid rash arthritis oral ulcerations photosensitivity serositis renal disorder neurologic disorder immunologic disorder. Fibromyalgia syndrome Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) previously called fibrositis,\\nis a diffuse pain syndrome and one of the most common causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain. It's characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, daily fatigue, and poor-quality sleep, along with multiple tender points on examination (in specific areas). More women than men are affected, and although FMS may occur at almost any age, the peak incidence is in patients between ages 20 and 60. FMS has also been reported in children, who have more diffuse pain and a higher incidence of sleep disturbances than adult patients. They may have fewer tender points and typically improve after 2\\nto 3 years of follow-up. Causes and incidence The cause of FMS is unknown, but it may be a primary disorder or occur in association with an underlying disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea syndrome. The pain is located mainly in muscle areas, but no distinct abnormalities have been documented on microscopic evaluation of\\nbiopsies of tender points when compared with normal muscle. One theory suggests that blood flow to the muscle is decreased (because of poor muscle aerobic conditioning, rather than other physiologic abnormalities); another suggests blood flow tin the thalamus and caudate\\nnucleus is decreased, leading to a lowered pain threshold. Still other theories suggest that the cause lies in endocrine dysfunction, such as abnormal pituitary-adrenal axis responses, or in abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in brain centers, which affect pain and sleep. Abnormal functioning of other pain-processing pathways may also be involved. Considerable overlap of symptoms with other pain syndromes, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, raises the question of association with infection with microbes, such as parvovirus B19. P The development of FMS may be multifactorial and influenced by stress (physical and mental), physical conditioning, poor-quality sleep, neuroendocrine factors, psychiatric factors and possibly, hormonal factors (explaining the predominance in women). Signs and symptoms The primary symptoms is diffuse, dull, aching pain that's\\ntypically concentrated across the neck and shoulders and in the lower back and proximal limbs. It can involve all body quadrants (bilateral upper trunk and arms, and bilateral lower trunk and legs) and typically is worse in the morning, when it's associated with stiffness. The pain can vary form day to day and be exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, weather changes, and inactivity. Sleep disturbance and fatigue are commonly reported. The patient awakens feeling fatigued and remains so throughout the day. Fatigue is commonly present from a half hour to several hours after rising in the morning and can last for the rest of the day. Other associated features that can occur with FMS include\\nirritable bowel syndrome, tension headaches, puffy hands (sensation of hand swelling, especially in the morning), and paresthesia. Diagnosis FMS is diagnosed in a patient with characteristic symptoms, multiple tender points on examination and exclusion of other illnesses that can cause similar features. Tender points are elicited by\\napplying a moderate amount of pressure to specific location. This examination can be fairly subjective, but many FMS patients with true tender points wince or withdraw when pressure is applied at a certain intensity. Nontender control points can also be tested to assess for conversion reactions (psychogenic rheumatism), in which patients hurt everywhere or exhibit other psychosomatic illnesses. (See Tender points of fibromyalgia .) TENDER POINTS OF FIBROMYALGIA The patient with fibromyalgia may report specific areas of tenderness. These areas are indicated in the illustrations below. Treatment Drugs, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, are typically used to improve sleep and control pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and corticosteroids are typically ineffective against FMS pain. An opioid to control chronic pain of FMS should be used only with extreme caution, preferably under the guidance of a pain specialist. P A physical therapist may assist in the management of FMS through the use of education, injection of tender points, massage therapy, and ultrasound treatments for particular problem areas. In a few studies, acupuncture, phototherapy, and mindbody exercises (such as yoga and tai chi) have been somewhat beneficial. Special considerations The most important aspect of FMS management is patient education. Patients must understand that although FMS pain can be severe and is often chronic, the syndrome is common and doesn't lead to deforming or life-threatening complications. A regular, low-impact aerobic exercise can\\nbe effective in improving the patient's muscle conditioning, energy level, and overall sense of well-being. The FMS patient should be taught\\npreexercise and postexercise stretching to minimize injury. Strongly encourage a low- intensity exercise program, such as walking, bicycling, or swimming, and to increase level of intensity as tolerated. Goodpasture's syndrome In Goodpasture's syndrome, hemoptysis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis follow the deposition of antibody against\\nthe alveolar and glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The prognosis improves with aggressive immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy along with dialysis or renal transplantation. Causes and incidence The cause of Goodpasture's syndrome is unknown. Although some cases have been associated with exposure to hydrocarbons or type 2 influenza, many have no precipitating events. The high incidence of human leukocyte antigen DRW2 in these patients suggests a genetic predisposition. Abnormal production and deposition of antibody against GBM and alveolar basement membrane activate the complement and inflammatory responses, resulting in glomerular and alveolar tissue damage. This syndrome may occur at any age but is most common in men between ages 20 and 30. A second peak incidence occurs between ages 50 and 70, with men and women in this age group affected equally. Complications Renal failure Pulmonary edema and hemorrhage Signs and symptoms Goodpasture's syndrome may initially cause malaise, fatigue, and pallor associated with severe iron deficiency anemia. Pulmonary findings range from slight dyspnea and cough with blood-tinged\\nsputum to hemoptysis and frank pulmonary hemorrhage. Subclinical pulmonary bleeding may precede overt hemorrhage and renal disease by months or years. Usually, renal findings are subtler, although some patients note hematuria and peripheral edema. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirmation of Goodpasture's syndrome requires measurement of circulating anti-GBM antibody by radioimmunoassay and linear staining of GBM and alveolar basement membrane by immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence of alveolar basement membrane shows linear deposition of immunoglobulin as well as complement 3 and fibrinogen. Immunofluorescence of GBM also shows linear deposition of immunoglobulin combined with detection of circulating anti-GBM antibody.\\nThis finding distinguishes Goodpasture's from other pulmonary- renal syndromes, such as Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis, and systemic\\nlupus erythematosus. A lung biopsy reveals interstitial and intra-alveolar hemorrhage with hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Chest X-ray reveals pulmonary P infiltrates in a diffuse, nodular pattern, and renal biopsy commonly shows focal necrotic lesions and cellular crescents. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels typically\\nincrease two to three times normal. Urinalysis may reveal red blood cells and cellular casts, which typify glomerular inflammation. Granular\\ncasts and proteinuria may also be observed. Treatment Treatment aims to remove antibody by plasmapheresis and to suppress antibody production with immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, to stop attacks by immune cells on the kidneys and lungs. Patients with renal failure may benefit from dialysis or transplantation. Aggressive ultrafiltration helps relieve pulmonary edema that may aggravate pulmonary hemorrhage. High-dose I.V. steroids also help control pulmonary hemorrhage. Special considerations Promote adequate oxygenation by elevating the bed's head and administering humidified oxygen. Encourage the patient to conserve his energy. Assess respirations and breath sounds regularly; note sputum quantity and quality. Monitor vital signs, arterial blood gases, hematocrit, and coagulation studies. Transfuse blood and administer steroids as ordered. Observe closely for drug adverse effects. Assess renal function by monitoring symptoms, intake and output, daily weights, creatinine clearance, and BUN and creatinine levels. Tell the patient and his family what signs\\nand symptoms to expect and how to relieve them. Carefully describe other treatment measures such as dialysis. Reiter's syndrome A self-limiting syndrome associated with polyarthritis (dominant feature), urethritis, balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis), conjunctivitis, and mucocutaneous lesions, Reiter's syndrome appears to be related to infection, either venereal or enteric. Causes and incidence The cause of Reiter's syndrome is unknown, but most cases\\nfollow venereal or enteric infection. Because 75% to 85% of patients with Reiter's syndrome test positive for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- B27, genetic susceptibility is likely. Reiter's syndrome has followed infections caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Chlamydia organisms. This disease usually affects young males (ages 20 to 40);\\nit's rare in females and children. However, due to the uncertainty of diagnosis and variations in the definition of this disorder, incidence is estimated at approximately 3.5 per 100,000 people. About 1% to 3% of all patients with nonspecific urethritis develop an episode of arthritis. Complications Chronic heel pain Ankylosing spondylitis Persistent joint pain and swelling Signs and symptoms The patient with Reiter's syndrome may complain of dysuria, hematuria, urgent and frequent urination, and mucopurulent penile discharge, with swelling and reddening of the urethral meatus. Small painless ulcers may erupt on the glans penis (balanitis). These coalesce to form irregular patches that cover the penis and scrotum. He may also experience suprapubic pain, fever, anorexia with weight loss, and other genitourinary (GU) complications, such as prostatitis and hemorrhagic cystitis. Arthritic symptoms usually follow GU or enteric symptoms and last from 2 to 4 months. Asymmetrical and extremely variable polyarticular P arthritis is most common, with a tendency to develop in weight-bearing joints of the legs and sometimes in the low back or sacroiliac joints. The arthritis is usually acute, with warm, erythematous, and painful joints, but it may be mild, with minimal synovitis. Muscle wasting is common near affected joints. Fingers and toes may swell and appear sausagelike. Ocular symptoms include mild bilateral conjunctivitis, possibly complicated by keratitis, iritis, retinitis, or optic neuritis.\\nIn severe cases, burning, itching, and profuse mucopurulent discharge are possible. In 30% of patients, skin lesions (keratoderma blennorrhagicum) develop 4 to 6 weeks after onset of other symptoms and may last for several weeks. These macular to hyperkeratotic lesions commonly resemble those of psoriasis. They usually occur on the palms and soles but can develop anywhere on the trunk, extremities, or scalp. Nails become thick, opaque, and brittle; keratic debris accumulates under the nails. In many patients, painless, transient ulcerations erupt\\non the buccal mucosa, palate, and tongue. Diagnosis Nearly all patients with Reiter's syndrome test positive for HLA-B27 and have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Mild anemia may develop. Urethral discharge and synovial fluid contain many WBCs, mostly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Synovial fluid is high in complement and protein and is grossly purulent. Cultures of discharge and synovial fluid rule out other causes such as gonococci. During the first few weeks, X-rays are normal and may remain so, but some patients may show osteoporosis in inflamed areas. If\\ninflammation persists, X-rays may show erosions of the small joints, periosteal proliferation (new bone formation) of involved joints, and calcaneal spurs. Treatment No specific treatment exists for Reiter's syndrome. Most patients recover in 2 to 16 weeks. About 50% of patients have recurring acute attacks, whereas the rest follow a chronic course, experiencing continued synovitis and sacroiliitis. In acute stages, limited weight bearing or complete bed rest may be necessary. Any underlying infection should be treated with antibiotics. Arthritis is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and pain relievers. Local administration of corticosteroids may help relieve persistent inflammation in one joint. Physical therapy includes range-of-motion and strengthening exercises and the use of padded or supportive shoes to prevent contractures and foot deformities.\\nTherapy to suppress the immune system may be considered in severe cases\\nbut is limited due to toxic adverse effects. Special considerations Explain Reiter's syndrome. Discuss the medications and their possible adverse effects. Warn the patient to take\\nmedications with meals or milk to prevent GI bleeding. Encourage normal daily activity and moderate exercise. Suggest a firm mattress and encourage good posture and body mechanics. Arrange for occupational counseling if the patient has severe or chronic joint impairment. Scleroderma Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is a diffuse connective tissue disease characterized by fibrotic, degenerative, and occasionally inflammatory changes in skin, blood vessels, synovial membranes, skeletal muscles, and internal organs (especially the esophagus, intestinal tract, thyroid, heart, lungs, and kidneys). This disease can be classified as systemic (involving skin, blood vessels, and internal organs) or localized (limited to skin and tissues). Each classification has distinctive forms. Systemic forms include: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (or CREST syndrome) \\u2014a benign form characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia P diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis \\u2014 characterized by generalized skin thickening and invasion of internal organs systemic sine scleroderma \\u2014a rare form of the disease, includes involvement of internal organs but does not have skin involvement. Localized forms include: morphea \\u2014characterized by patchy skin changes with a droplike appearance linear scleroderma \\u2014characterized\\nby a band of thickened skin on the face or extremities that severely damages underlying tissues, causing atrophy and deformity (most common in childhood). Other forms include chemically induced localized scleroderma, eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (recently associated with ingestion of L- tryptophan), toxic oil syndrome (associated with contaminated oil), and graft-versus-host disease. Causes and incidence The cause of scleroderma is unknown. Risk factors include exposure to silica dust and polyvinyl chloride. Scleroderma affects 300,000 people in the United States, more women than men, especially between ages 30 and 50. About 30% of patients with scleroderma die within 5 years of onset. Complications Arrhythmias Dyspnea Malignant hypertension Signs and symptoms Scleroderma typically begins with Raynaud's phenomenon \\u2014 blanching, cyanosis, and erythema of the fingers and toes in response to\\nstress or exposure to cold. Progressive phalangeal resorption may shorten the fingers. Compromised circulation, which results from abnormal thickening of the arterial intima, may cause slowly healing ulcerations on the tips of the fingers or toes that may lead to gangrene. Raynaud's phenomenon may precede scleroderma by months or years. Later symptoms include pain, stiffness, and finger and joint swelling. Skin thickening produces taut, shiny skin over the entire hand and forearm. Facial skin also becomes tight and inelastic, causing a masklike appearance and \\u201cpinching\\u201d of the mouth. As tightening\\nprogresses, contractures may develop. GI dysfunction causes frequent reflux, heartburn, dysphagia, and bloating after meals. These symptoms may cause the patient to decrease food intake and lose weight. Other GI effects include abdominal distention, diarrhea, constipation, and malodorous floating stools. Diagnosis Typical cutaneous changes provide the first clue to diagnosis. Results of diagnostic tests include: blood studies\\u2014slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positive rheumatoid factor in 25% to 35%\\nof patients, and positive antinuclear antibody test chest X-rays\\u2014bilateral basilar pulmonary fibrosis electrocardiogram\\u2014possible nonspecific abnormalities related to myocardial fibrosis GI X-rays\\u2014distal esophageal hypomotility and stricture, duodenal loop dilation, small-bowel malabsorption pattern, and large diverticula hand X-rays\\u2014terminal phalangeal tuft resorption, subcutaneous calcification, and joint space narrowing and erosion pulmonary function studies\\u2014decreased diffusion and vital capacity and restrictive lung disease skin biopsy\\u2014may show changes consistent with the disease's progress, such as marked thickening of the dermis and\\nocclusive vessel changes urinalysis\\u2014proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and casts (with renal involvement). Treatment Currently, no cure exists for scleroderma. Treatment aims\\nto preserve normal body functions and minimize complications. Use of an immunosuppressant such as chlorambucil is a common palliative measure. Corticosteroids and colchicine seem to stabilize symptoms; D- penicillamine may be helpful. Blood platelet levels need to be monitored throughout drug therapy. Other treatments vary according to symptoms: chronic digital ulcerations\\u2014a digital plaster cast to immobilize the area, minimize trauma, and maintain cleanliness; possibly surgical debridement esophagitis with stricture\\u2014antacids, cimetidine, periodic esophageal dilation, and a soft, bland diet hand debilitation\\u2014physical therapy to maintain function and promote muscle strength, heat therapy to relieve joint stiffness, and patient teaching to make performance of daily activities easier Raynaud's phenomenon\\u2014various vasodilators and antihypertensive agents (such as methyldopa or calcium channel blockers), intermittent cervical sympathetic blockade or, rarely, thoracic sympathectomy scleroderma kidney (with malignant hypertension and impending renal failure)\\u2014 dialysis, antihypertensives, and calcium channel blockers small-bowel involvement (diarrhea, pain, malabsorption, and weight loss)\\u2014 broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as erythromycin or tetracycline, to counteract bacterial overgrowth in the duodenum and jejunum related to hypomotility. Special considerations P Assess the patient's motion restrictions, pain, vital signs, intake and output, respiratory function, and daily weight. Because of compromised circulation, warn against finger-stick blood tests. Remember that air conditioning may aggravate Raynaud's phenomenon. Help the patient and his family adjust to the patient's new body image and to the limitations and dependence that these changes cause. Teach the patient to avoid fatigue by pacing activities and organizing schedules to include necessary rest. Stress to the patient and his family the need to accept the fact that this condition is incurable. Encourage them\\nto express their feelings and help them cope with their fears and frustrations by offering information about the disease, its treatment, and relevant diagnostic tests. Whenever possible, let the patient participate in treatment by measuring his own intake and output, planning his own diet, assisting in dialysis, giving himself heat therapy, and doing prescribed exercises. Direct the patient to seek out support groups, which can be found in every state. Instruct the patient to call 1-800-722-HOPE or go to www.scleroderma.org . Vasculitis Vasculitis includes a broad spectrum of disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of blood vessels. Its clinical effects, which reflect tissue ischemia caused by blood flow obstruction, and confirming laboratory procedures depend on the vessels involved. The prognosis is variable. For example, hypersensitivity vasculitis is usually a benign disorder limited to the skin, but more extensive polyarteritis nodosa can be rapidly fatal. Vasculitis can occur at any age, except for mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, which occurs only during childhood. Vasculitis may be a primary disorder or occur secondary to other disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Causes and incidence How vascular damage develops in vasculitis isn't well understood. It has been associated with a history of serious infectious disease, such as hepatitis B or bacterial endocarditis, and high-dose antibiotic therapy. Current theory holds that it's initiated by excessive circulating antigen, which triggers the formation of soluble antigen-antibody complexes. These complexes can't be effectively cleared\\nby the reticuloendothelial system, so they're deposited in blood vessel\\nwalls (type III hypersensitivity). Increased vascular permeability associated with release of vasoactive amines by platelets and basophils enhances such deposition. The deposited complexes activate the complement cascade, resulting in chemotaxis of neutrophils, which release lysosomal enzymes. In turn, these enzymes cause vessel damage and necrosis, which may precipitate thrombosis, occlusion, hemorrhage, and ischemia. Another mechanism that may contribute to vascular damage is the cell- mediated (T-cell) immune response. In this response, circulating antigen triggers the release of soluble mediators by sensitized lymphocytes, which attracts macrophages. The macrophages release intracellular enzymes, which cause vascular damage. They can also transform into the epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells that typify the granulomatous vasculitides. Phagocytosis of immune complexes by macrophages enhances granuloma formation. Complications Renal failure Renal hypertension Glomerulitis Fibrous scarring of lung tissue Stroke GI bleeding Necrotizing vasculitis P 8 P Spontaneous hemorrhage Intestinal obstruction Myocardial infarction Pericarditis Rupture or mesenteric aneurysms Signs and symptoms The clinical effects of vasculitis vary according to the blood vessels involved. Diagnosis Laboratory tests performed to confirm a diagnosis of vasculitis depend on the blood vessels involved. (See Types of vasculitis .) TYPES OF VASCULITIS Vasculitis occurs in various forms; diagnosis depends on the presenting signs and symptoms. Type Vessels involved Signs and symptoms Diagnosis Polyarteritis nodosa Small\\nto medium arteries throughout the body (Lesions tend to be segmental, occur at bifurcations and branchings of arteries, and spread distally to arterioles.

In primary vasculitis, treatment\\nmay involve removal of an offending antigen or use of anti-inflammatory\\nor immunosuppressant drugs. For example, antigenic drugs, food, and other environmental substances should be identified and eliminated, if possible. Drug therapy in primary vasculitis commonly involves low-dose cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg orally daily) with daily corticosteroids. In rapidly fulminant vasculitis, cyclophosphamide dosage may be increased to 4 mg/kg daily for the first 2 to 3 days, followed by the regular dose. Prednisone should be given in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day in divided doses for P 7 to 10 days, with consolidation to a single morning dose by 2 to 3 weeks. When the vasculitis appears to be in remission or when prescribed cytotoxic drugs take full effect, corticosteroids are tapered down to a single daily dose. Finally, an alternate-day schedule of steroids may continue for 3 to 6 months before\\nslow discontinuation of steroids. In secondary vasculitis, treatment focuses on the underlying disorder. Special considerations Assess patients with Wegener's granulomatosis for dry nasal mucosa. Instill nose drops to lubricate the\\nmucosa and help diminish crusting, or irrigate the nasal passages with warm normal saline solution. Monitor vital signs. Use a Doppler ultrasonic flowmeter, if available, to auscultate blood pressure in patients with Takayasu's arteritis, whose peripheral pulses are generally difficult to palpate. Monitor intake and output. Check daily for\\nedema. Keep the patient well hydrated (3 L daily) to reduce the risk of\\nhemorrhagic cystitis associated with cyclophosphamide therapy. Provide emotional support to help the patient and his family cope with an altered body image \\u2014 the result of the disorder or its therapy. (For example, Wegener's granulomatosis may be associated with saddle nose, steroids may cause weight gain, and cyclophosphamide may cause alopecia.) Teach the patient how to recognize drug adverse effects. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count during cyclophosphamide therapy to prevent severe leukopenia. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis Diffuse, inflammatory myopathies of unknown cause, polymyositis and dermatomyositis produce symmetrical weakness of striated muscle \\u2014 primarily proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, neck, and pharynx. In dermatomyositis, such muscle weakness is accompanied by cutaneous involvement. These diseases usually progress slowly, with frequent exacerbations and remissions. They occur in twice as many females as males (except dermatomyositis with malignant tumor, which is most common in males older than age 40). The prognosis usually worsens with age. Death commonly occurs from associated cancer, respiratory disease, or heart failure or from the adverse effects of drug therapy. On the other hand, 80% to 90% of affected children regain normal function with proper treatment. However, if untreated, childhood dermatomyositis may progress rapidly to\\ndisabling contractures and muscle atrophy. Causes and incidence Although the cause of polymyositis remains puzzling, researchers believe that it may result from an autoimmune reaction. Presumably, the patient's T cells inappropriately recognize muscle fiber\\nantigens as foreign and attack muscle tissue, causing diffuse or focal muscle fiber degeneration. (Regeneration of new muscle cells then follows, producing remission.) Polymyositis and dermatomyositis may be associated with other disorders, such as allergic reactions; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); scleroderma; rheumatoid arthritis; Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome; carcinomas of the lung, breast, or other organs; systemic viral infection; or D-penicillamine administration. Annual incidence is 5 to 10 in 100,000 people. Signs and symptoms Polymyositis begins acutely or insidiously with muscle weakness, tenderness, and discomfort. It affects proximal muscles more than distal muscles and impairs performance of ordinary activities. The patient may have trouble getting up from a chair, combing his hair, reaching into a high cupboard, climbing stairs, or even raising his head\\nfrom a pillow. Other muscular symptoms include inability to move against resistance, proximal dysphagia, dysphonia, and difficulty breathing. In dermatomyositis, an erythematous rash usually erupts on the face, neck, upper back, chest, and arms as well as around the nail beds. A characteristic heliotropic rash appears on the eyelids, accompanied by periorbital edema. Gottron's papules (violet, flat-topped\\nlesions) may appear on the interphalangeal joints. P Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis requires a muscle biopsy that shows necrosis, degeneration, regeneration, and interstitial chronic lymphocytic infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging and an electrocardiogram, as well as the use of electromyography, aid in diagnosis. Other tests differentiate polymyositis from diseases that\\ncause similar muscular or cutaneous symptoms, such as muscular dystrophy, advanced trichinosis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and SLE. Typical laboratory results in polymyositis include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated muscle enzyme levels (creatine kinase, aldolase, and\\nserum aspartate aminotransferase) not attributable to hemolysis of red blood cells or hepatic or other diseases. Other laboratory results include increased urine creatine level (more than 150 mg/24 hours), decreased creatinine level, and positive antinuclear antibodies. Electromyography shows polyphasic short-duration potentials, fibrillation (positive spike waves), and bizarre high-frequency repetitive changes. Treatment High-dose corticosteroid therapy relieves inflammation and lowers muscle enzyme levels. Within 2 to 6 weeks after treatment, serum muscle enzyme levels usually return to normal, and muscle strength improves, permitting a gradual tapering down of corticosteroid dosage. If the patient responds poorly to corticosteroids, treatment may include cytotoxic or immunosuppressant drugs. Supportive therapy includes bed rest during the acute phase, range-of-motion (ROM) exercises to prevent contractures, analgesics and application of heat to relieve painful muscle spasms, and diphenhydramine to relieve itching. Patients older than age 40 need thorough assessment for coexisting cancer. Special considerations Assess level of pain, muscle weakness, and ROM daily. Give analgesics as needed. If the patient is confined to bed, prevent\\npressure ulcers by giving good skin care. To prevent footdrop and contractures, apply high- topped sneakers, and assist with passive ROM exercises at least four times daily. Teach the patient's family how to perform these exercises on the patient. If 24-hour urine collection for creatine or creatinine is necessary, make sure your coworkers understand the procedure. When you assist with muscle biopsy, make sure the biopsy isn't taken from an area of recent needle insertion. If the patient has a rash, warn him not to\\nscratch, as it may cause infection. If antipruritic medication doesn't relieve severe itching, apply tepid sponges or compresses. Encourage the patient to feed and dress himself to the best of his ability but to ask for help when needed. Advise him to pace his activities to counteract muscle weakness. Encourage him to express his anxiety. Ease his fear of dependence by reassuring him that muscle weakness is probably temporary. Explain the disease to the patient and his\\nfamily. Prepare them for diagnostic procedures and possible adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy (weight gain, hirsutism, hypertension,\\nedema, amenorrhea, purplish striae, glycosuria, acne, and easy bruising). Advise a low- sodium diet to prevent fluid retention. Emphatically warn against abruptly discontinuing corticosteroids. Reassure the patient that steroidinduced weight gain will diminish when the drug is discontinued. IMMUNODEFICIENCY X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia is a recessive, congenital disorder in which all five immunoglobulins (Ig) \\u2014 IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and P IgE \\u2014 and circulating B cells are absent or deficient but T\\ncells are intact. It's also called Bruton's agammaglobulinemia and X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Affecting males almost exclusively, this disorder causes severe, recurrent infections during infancy. Prognosis is good with early treatment, except in infants who develop polio or persistent viral infection. Infection usually causes some permanent damage, especially in\\nthe neurologic or respiratory system. Causes and incidence In this disease, B cells and B-cell precursors may be present in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, but a mutation in the B-cell protein tyrosine kinase keep B cells from maturing and secreting immunoglobulin. Without protective immunoglobulins, the affected person develops repeated infections. Worldwide, malnutrition is the primary cause of antibody disorders. Humoral immune deficiencies account for 50% of all primary immunodeficiencies. IgA deficiency is the most common antibody deficiency symdrome, followed by common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The incidence of these two disorders is 1 in 700 persons. Selective IgM deficiency is rare. IgG4 deficiency occurs in 10% to 15% of the population. Complications Chronic otitis media Chronic sinusitis Encephalitis Failure to thrive Hepatitis Enteroviral infections Meningitis Signs and symptoms Typically, the infant with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia\\nis asymptomatic until age 6 months, when transplacental maternal immunoglobulins that provided immunity have been depleted. He then develops recurrent bacterial otitis media, pneumonia, dermatitis, bronchitis, and meningitis \\u2014 usually caused by pneumococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae , or other gram-negative organisms. Purulent conjunctivitis, abnormal dental caries, and polyarthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis may also occur. Severe malabsorption associated with infestation by Giardia lamblia may retard development. Despite recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are usually absent. Diagnosis Diagnosis of X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia can be especially difficult because recurrent infections are common even in normal infants (many of whom don't start producing their own antibodies until age 18 to 20 months). Immunoelectrophoresis and quantitative immunoglobulins (nephelometry) confirm decreased levels, or a total absence, of IgM, IgA, and IgG in the serum. IgG is usually less than 200\\nmg/dl, and IgA and IgM are almost unmeasurable. However, diagnosis by this method usually isn't possible until the infant is 9 months old. Antigenic stimulation confirms an inability to produce specific antibodies, although cellular immunity remains intact. Treatment Treatment aims to prevent or control infections and to boost the patient's immune response. Injection of immune serum globulin (gamma globulin, IV Ig) helps maintain immune response. Because these injections are painful, give them deep into a large muscle mass, such as the gluteal or thigh muscles, and massage well. If the dosage is more than 1.5 ml, divide it and inject it into more than one site; for frequent injections, rotate the injection sites. Because immune globulin\\nis composed primarily of IgG, the patient may also need fresh frozen plasma infusions to provide IgA and IgM. Mucosal secretory IgA can't be replaced by therapy, resulting in crippling pulmonary disease in many patients. P Judicious use of antibiotics also helps combat infection;\\nin some cases, chronic broad-spectrum antibiotics may be indicated. During acute infection, monitor the patient closely. Maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Perform chest physiotherapy if required. Special considerations Carefully explain all treatment measures, and make sure the patient and his family understand the disorder. Teach the patient and his family how to recognize early signs of infection and counsel them to report such signs\\npromptly. Advise them to have cuts and scrapes cleaned immediately. Warn them to avoid crowds and people who have active infections. Suggest genetic counseling if parents have questions about vulnerability of future offspring. Common variable immunodeficiency Common variable immunodeficiency is characterized by progressive deterioration of B-cell (humoral) immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. Unlike X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia, this disorder (also known as acquired hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia with immunoglobulin [Ig]-bearing B cells) usually causes symptoms after infancy and childhood, between ages 25 and 40. It affects males and females equally and usually doesn't interfere with normal life span or normal pregnancy and offspring. Causes and incidence The cause of common variable immunodeficiency is unknown.\\nMost patients have a normal circulating B-cell count but defective synthesis or release of immunoglobulins. Many also exhibit progressive deterioration of T-cell (cell-mediated) immunity revealed by delayed hypersensitivity skin testing. Complications Conjunctivitis Chronic sinusitis Giardia lamblia GI infection Upper and lower respiratory tract infections Encephalitis Meningitis Hemolytic anemia Signs and symptoms In common variable immunodeficiency, pyogenic bacterial infections are characteristic but tend to be chronic rather than acute (as in X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia). Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic bacterial conjunctivitis, and malabsorption (commonly associated with infestation by Giardia lamblia ) are usually the first clues to immunodeficiency. Common variable immunodeficiency may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic anemia, and pernicious anemia, and with cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma. Diagnosis Characteristic diagnostic markers in this disorder are decreased serum IgM, IgA, and IgG levels detected by immunoelectrophoresis, along with a normal circulating B-cell count. Antigenic stimulation confirms an inability to produce specific antibodies; cell-mediated immunity may be intact or delayed. X-rays usually show signs of chronic lung disease or sinusitis. Treatment Treatment and care of patients with common variable immunodeficiency are essentially the same as for those with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. Injection of immune globulin (usually weekly to monthly) helps maintain the immune response. Because these injections are painful, give them deep into a large muscle mass, such as the gluteal or\\nthigh muscles, and massage well. If the dosage is more than 1.5 ml, divide the dose and inject it into more than one site; for frequent injections, rotate the injection sites. Because immune globulin is composed primarily of IgG, the patient may also need fresh frozen plasma\\ninfusions to provide IgA and IgM. Antibiotics are the mainstay for combating infection. Regular X-rays and pulmonary function studies help monitor lung infection; chest physiotherapy may be ordered to forestall or help clear\\nsuch infection. Special considerations Teach the patient and his family how to recognize early signs of infection and counsel them to report such signs\\npromptly. Advise the patient to avoid crowds and people who have active\\ninfections. Stress the importance of good nutrition and regular follow-up care. IgA deficiency Total absence or severe deficiency of immunoglobulin (Ig) A, also known as Janeway Type 3 dysgammaglobulinemia, is the most common primary immunoglobulin deficiency, appearing in as many as 1 in 400 to 1,000 people. IgA \\u2014 the major immunoglobulin in human saliva, nasal and bronchial fluids, and intestinal secretions \\u2014 guards against bacterial and viral reinfections. Consequently, IgA deficiency leads to chronic sinopulmonary infections, allergies, chronic\\ndiarrhea, GI diseases, and other disorders. The prognosis is good for patients who receive correct treatment, especially if they have no associated disorders. Causes and incidence IgA deficiency seems to be linked to autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. The disorder has familial trends and occurs frequently in immediate relatives of individuals with common variable immunodeficiency. The presence of normal numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes carrying IgA receptors and of normal amounts of other P immunoglobulins suggests that B cells may not be secreting IgA, as they haven't matured into IgA-producing plasma cells. Congenital intrauterine infection with rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus can result in selective IgA deficiency. Treatment for seizures with phenytoin and hydantoin, as well as Wilson's disease (an inherited disorder treated with penicillamine), can result in temporarily acquired selective IgA deficiency. When the medications are stopped, the IgA level returns to normal. Some drugs such as anticonvulsants may cause transient IgA deficiency. Signs and symptoms Some IgA-deficient patients have no symptoms, possibly because they have extra amounts of low-molecular-weight IgM. This immunoglobulin takes over IgA function and helps maintain immunologic defenses. Among patients who develop symptoms, chronic sinopulmonary infection is the most common. Other effects are respiratory allergy, often triggered by infection; GI tract diseases, such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and regional enteritis; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, immunohemolytic anemia, and chronic hepatitis; and malignant tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, reticulum cell sarcoma, and thymoma. Age of onset varies. Some IgA-deficient children with recurrent respiratory disease and middle ear inflammation may begin to synthesize IgA spontaneously as recurrent infections subside and their condition improves. Diagnosis Serum immunoelectrophoresis and quantitative immunologic analyses of patients with IgA-deficiency show serum IgA levels below 7 mg/dl. Although IgA is usually absent from secretions in patients with IgA- deficiency, levels may be normal in rare cases. IgE is normal, whereas IgM may be normal or elevated in serum and secretions. Normally absent low-molecular-weight IgM may be present. Tests may also indicate autoantibodies and antibodies against IgG (rheumatoid factor), IgM, and bovine milk. Cell-mediated immunity and secretory piece (the glycopeptide that transports IgA) are usually normal, and most circulating B cells appear normal. Treatment Selective IgA deficiency has no known cure. Treatment aims to control symptoms of associated diseases, such as respiratory and\\nGI infections, and is generally the same as for a patient with normal IgA. ALERT Don't give an IgA-deficient patient immune globulin (IV Ig) because sensitization may lead to anaphylaxis during future administration of blood products. If transfusion with blood products is necessary, minimize\\nthe risk of adverse reaction by using washed red blood cells or avoid the reaction completely by cross-matching the patient's blood with that of an IgA- deficient donor. Special considerations Because this is a lifelong disorder, teach the patient to\\nprevent infection, to recognize its early signs, and to seek treatment promptly. DiGeorge syndrome DiGeorge syndrome, also called congenital thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, is a disorder characterized by the partial or total absence of cell- mediated immunity that results from a deficiency of T lymphocytes. It typically produces life-threatening hypocalcemia that may be associated with cardiovascular and facial anomalies. Patients seldom live beyond age 2 without a fetal thymus transplant; the prognosis improves when this transplant, correction of hypocalcemia, and repair of\\ncardiac anomalies are possible. Causes and incidence DiGeorge syndrome is probably caused by abnormal fetal development (12th week of gestation) of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, which interferes with thymus formation. As a result, the thymus\\nis P completely absent or partially present in an abnormal location, causing deficient T cell-mediated immunity. (See Role of the thymus in immune response .) This syndrome has been associated with maternal alcoholism and resultant fetal alcohol syndrome. Complications Hypocalcemia (life-threatening) Seizures Central nervous system damage Failure to thrive Anorexia Diarrhea Weight loss Cardiac failure Signs and symptoms Symptoms are usually obvious at birth or shortly thereafter. An infant with DiGeorge syndrome may have low-set prominent ears, notched ear pinnae, a mouth without the usual bow-shaped lip, an undersized jaw, and abnormally wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) that are low-set and posteriorly angulated. Additionally, an infant may have a bifid uvula and a high, arched palate. Congenital heart anomalies are common. Cardiovascular abnormalities include great blood vessel anomalies (these may also develop soon after birth) and tetralogy of Fallot. An infant with thymic hypoplasia (rather than aplasia) may experience a spontaneous return of cell-mediated immunity but can develop severe T- cell deficiencies later in life. This allows exaggerated susceptibility to viral, fungal, or bacterial infections, which may be overwhelming. Hypoparathyroidism, usually associated with DiGeorge syndrome, typically causes tetany, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia (calcium levels less than 7 mg/dl) develops early and is unusually resistant to treatment. It can lead to tetany, seizures, central nervous system damage, and early heart failure. Rare cases of partial immunoglobulin (Ig) A deficiency have been linked to chromosome 1 and deletions of the IgA1 or IgA2 genes. Alterations in chromosome 6 suggest altered major histocompatibility complex, which is reflected in decreased T-cell responses. Aberrations in chromosome 18 are linked to facial abnormalities, nystagmus, hypotonia, atretic or stenotic ear canals, hearing loss, and mental retardation. Diagnosis Immediate diagnosis is difficult unless the infant has typical facial anomalies \\u2014 normally the first clues to the disorder. A definitive diagnosis depends on successful treatment of hypocalcemia and\\nother life-threatening birth defects during the first few weeks of life. Such diagnosis rests on proof of decreased or absent T lymphocytes\\n(sheep cell test, lymphopenia), partial B-cell immunodeficiency, and of\\nan absent thymus (chest X-ray). Immunoglobulin assays are useless because antibodies present are usually from maternal circulation. ROLE OF THE THYMUS IN IMMUNE RESPONSE The thymus provides an environment in which T cells develop and learn to distinguish self from nonself during fetal and early postnatal stages. Most cells that enter the thymus are destroyed. T-cell clones that react strongly to self and those that don't recognize\\nself are deleted (negative selection). T-cell clones that recognize self but don't react strongly against self are positively selected. After early life, mature T cells reside primarily in peripheral lymph organs and recirculate in blood and lymph. Additional tests showing low serum calcium level, elevated serum phosphorus level, and missing parathyroid hormone confirm hypoparathyroidism. Treatment P ALERT Life-threatening hypocalcemia must be treated immediately, but it's unusually resistant and requires aggressive treatment, for example, with a rapid I.V. infusion of 10% solution of calcium gluconate. During such an infusion, monitor heart rate and watch carefully to avoid infiltration. Remember that calcium supplements must be given with vitamin D, or sometimes also with parathyroid hormone, to\\nensure effective calcium utilization. After hypocalcemia is under control, a fetal thymus transplant may restore normal cell-mediated immunity. Cardiac anomalies require surgical repair when possible. Special considerations Instruct the patient with DiGeorge syndrome to follow a low- phosphorus diet and educate him about measures to prevent infection. Teach the parents of an infant with Di-George syndrome to watch for signs of infection and have it treated immediately, to keep the infant away from crowds or any other potential sources of infection, and to provide good hygiene and adequate nutrition\\nand hydration. Advise the parents to schedule and keep regular follow-up visits to the infant's pediatrician. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious secondary immunodeficiency disorder caused by the human immunodeficiency\\nvirus (HIV). Both diseases are characterized by the progressive destruction of cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity with subsequent effects on humoral (B- cell) immunity because of the pivotal role of the CD4+ helper T cells in immune reactions. Immunodeficiency makes the patient susceptible to opportunistic infections, unusual cancers, and other abnormalities. (See Common infections and neoplasms in HIV and AIDS .) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first described AIDS in 1981. Since then, the CDC has declared a case surveillance definition for AIDS and modified it several times, most recently in January 2000. Causes and incidence AIDS results from infection with HIV, which has two forms: HIV-1 and HIV- 2. Both forms of HIV have the same modes of transmission and similar opportunistic infections associated with AIDS, but studies indicate that HIV-2 develops more slowly and presents with milder symptoms than HIV- 1. Transmission occurs through contact with infected blood or body fluids and is associated with identifiable high-risk behaviors. It's disproportionately represented in: homosexual and bisexual men persons who use illicit I.V. drugs neonates of infected females recipients of contaminated blood or blood products (incidence dramatically decreased since mid-1985) heterosexual partners of persons in the former groups. Complications Opportunistic infections Certain cancers Signs and symptoms A person with HIV may remain asymptomatic for months or years. Initially, laboratory evidence or seroconversion to HIV antibodies may be the only clinical evidence of infection. However, as the disease progresses, the patient may develop generalized adenopathy and nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and fevers. As the patient's T-cell count lowers further, neurologic symptoms, opportunistic infections, and certain normally rare P cancers may develop. HIV also destroys lymph nodes and immunologic organs, leading to major dysfunctions of the immunological system. Eventually, HIV advances to AIDS. (Some individuals, termed nonprogressors, develop AIDS very slowly or not at all. They seem to have genetic differences that prevent the virus from attaching to certain immune receptors.) PEDIATRIC TIP The clinical course varies slightly in children, who have a shorter incubation time (mean, 17 months.) Signs\\nand symptoms resemble those in adults, except for findings related to sexually transmitted disease (STD). Children show virtually all of the opportunistic infections observed in adults, with a higher incidence of bacterial infections: otitis media, pneumonias other than that caused by Pneumocystis carinii, sepsis, chronic salivary gland enlargement, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Signs and symptoms may occur at any time after infection with HIV, but AIDS isn't officially diagnosed until the patient's CD4+ T-cell count falls below 200 cells/mcl or the associated clinical conditions or disease. The most commonly performed tests, antibody tests, indicate HIV infection indirectly by revealing HIV antibodies. The recommended protocol requires initial screening of individuals and blood\\nproducts with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A positive ELISA should be repeated and then confirmed by an alternate method, usually the Western blot or an immunofluorescence assay. The radioimmunoprecipitation assay is considered more sensitive and specific\\nthan the Western blot, but because it requires radioactive materials, it's a poor choice for routine screening. In addition, antibody testing isn't reliable. Because people produce detectable levels of P antibodies at different rates \\u2014 a \\u201cwindow\\u201d varying from a few weeks to as long as 35 months in one documented case \\u2014 an HIV-infected person can test negative for HIV antibodies. Antibody tests are also unreliable in neonates because transferred maternal antibodies persist for 6 to 10 months. To overcome these problems, direct tests are used, including antigen tests (p24 antigen), HIV cultures, nucleic acid probes of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the polymerase chain reaction. (See Laboratory tests for diagnosing and tracking HIV and assessing immune status, page 488.) Additional tests to support the diagnosis and help evaluate the severity of immunosuppression include CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subset counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, serum beta 2 -microglobulin, p24 antigen, neopterin levels, and anergy testing. Because many opportunistic infections in AIDS patients are reactivations of previous infections, patients are also tested for associated neoplasms, infections, and STDs. Treatment There is no cure for either HIV or AIDS. However, significant advances have been made to help patients control signs and symptoms and impair disease progression. Because HIV can become resistant to any drug, health care professionals use combination treatments and multiple drug regimens to suppress the virus. Patients on medication remain infectious. COMMON INFECTIONS AND NEOPLASMS IN HIV AND AIDS This is a list of commonly seen disorders with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is diagnosed when a patient diagnosed with HIV has a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 200 cells/mcl. Common infections in a patient with a CD4+ count less than 350 cells/mcl include: \\u2013 herpes simplex virus \\u2013 herpes zoster \\u2013 Mycobacterium tuberculosis \\u2013 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \\u2013 oral or vaginal thrush. Common infections in a patient with a CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mcl include: \\u2013 Candida esophagitis \\u2013 Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia. Common infections in a patient with a CD4+ count less than 100 cells/mcl include: \\u2013 AIDS dementia \\u2013 Cryptococcal meningitis \\u2013 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \\u2013 toxoplasmosis encephalitis \\u2013 wasting syndrome. Common infections in a patient with a CD4+ count less than 50 cells/mcl include: \\u2013 Cytomegalovirus infection \\u2013 Mycobacterium avium. Common neoplasms in patients with HIV and AIDS include: \\u2013 Hodgkin's lymphoma \\u2013 Kaposi's sarcoma \\u2013 malignant lymphoma.

HAART aims to reduce the number of HIV particles in the blood as measured by viral load, thus increasing T-cell\\ncounts and improving the immunologic system's functioning. A regular and vigilant medication regimen is critical or resistance will develop because HIV strains mutate and can become resistant to HAART relatively easily. The nucleoside analogues (sometimes called reverse transcriptase inhibitors) have been the mainstay of AIDS therapy in recent years. These drugs interfere with viral reverse transcriptase, which impairs HIV's ability to turn its ribonucleic acid into deoxyribonucleic acid for insertion into the host cell. PREVENTION PREVENTING AIDS TRANSMISSION Health care workers and the public are advised to use precautions in all situations that risk exposure to blood, body fluids, and secretions. These precautions include: Educate the patient and family, sexual partners, and friends about disease transmission and prevention of extending the disease to others. Inform the patient not to donate blood, blood products, organs, tissue, or sperm. If the patient uses I. V. drugs, caution him not to share needles. Inform the patient that high-risk sexual practices for AIDS transmission are those that exchange body fluids, such as vaginal or anal intercourse without a condom. Discuss safer sexual practices, such as hugging, petting, mutual masturbation, and protected sexual intercourse.\\nAbstaining is also the most protective method of not transmitting the disease. Advise female patients of childbearing age\\nto avoid pregnancy. Explain that an infant may become infected before birth, during delivery, or during breast-feeding. Antiretroviral therapy typically begins when the patient's CD4+ T-cell count drops to less than 500/\\u00b5l or when the patient develops an opportunistic infection. Most clinicians recommend starting the patient on a combination of these drugs in an attempt to gain the maximum benefit and to inhibit the production of resistant mutant strains of HIV. The drug combinations and dosages are then altered, depending on the patient's response. Increasingly, physicians are basing changes in therapy on\\nthe patient's viral load rather than on his CD4+ T-cell count. Because the CD4+ count is influenced by the total white blood cell count, changes in the CD4+ count may have nothing to do with changes in the patient's HIV status. Many physicians suggest that patients on antiretroviral therapy have their viral load checked every 3 months. The increasing use of protease inhibitors (PIs) has greatly increased the life expectancy of patients with AIDS. These drugs\\nblock the enzyme protease, which HIV needs to produce virions, the viral particles that spread the virus to other cells. The use of PIs dramatically reduces viral load \\u2014 sometimes to undetectable levels \\u2014 while producing a corresponding increase in the CD4+ T-cell count and, because they act at P a different site than nucleoside analogues, the PIs don't produce additional adverse effects when added to a patient's regimen. Antiviral therapy includes the use of multiple combined drug therapies that suppress the replication of the HIV virus in the body. After antiviral therapy is initiated, treatment should be aggressive. Initially, highly active antiviral therapy, consisting of a triple drug therapy regimen \\u2014 a PI and two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors \\u2014 is recommended. In addition to these primary treatments, anti-infectives are used to combat opportunistic infections (some are used prophylactically to help patients resist opportunistic infections), and antineoplastic drugs are used to fight associated neoplasms. Supportive treatments help maintain nutritional status and relieve pain and other distressing physical and psychological symptoms. Special considerations Advise health care workers and the public to use precautions in all situations that risk exposure to blood, body fluids, and secretions. Diligently practicing standard precautions can prevent the inadvertent transmission of AIDS and other infectious diseases that are transmitted by similar routes. (See Preventing AIDS transmission. ) Recognize that a diagnosis of AIDS is profoundly distressing because of the disease's social impact and discouraging prognosis. The patient may lose his job and financial security as well as the support of family and friends. Do your best to help him cope with an altered body image, the emotional burden of serious illness, and the threat of death, and encourage and assist the patient in learning about AIDS societies and support programs. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is a form of candidiasis (moniliasis) that usually develops during the first year of life but occasionally occurs as late as the 20s. Affecting males and females, it's characterized by repeated infection with Candida albicans that may result from an inherited defect in cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity. (Humoral [B-cell] immunity remains intact and provides a normal antibody response to C. albicans. ) In some patients, an autoimmune response affecting the endocrine system may induce various endocrinopathies. Despite chronic candidiasis, these patients seldom die of\\nsystemic infection. Instead, they usually die of hepatic or endocrine failure. The prognosis for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis depends on the severity of the associated endocrinopathy. Patients with associated endocrinopathy seldom live beyond their 30s. Causes and incidence No characteristic immunologic defects have been identified in this infection, but many patients have a diminished response to various antigens or to Candida alone. In some patients, anergy may result from deficient migration inhibition factor, a mediator normally produced by lymphocytes. Candida species infections are the most common causes of fungal infections in patients who are immunocompromised. About 3 of every 4 females have at least one bout of vulvovaginal candidiasis during their lifetimes. In individuals who are HIVpositive, more than 90% experience oropharyngeal candidiasis and 10% have at least one episode of esophageal candidiasis. Complications Addison's disease Nephrotoxicity Hypoparathyroidism Hypocalcemia with seizures Diabetes mellitus Pernicious anemia Corticotropin deficiency Ovarian failure Signs and symptoms P Chronic candidal infections can affect the skin, mucous membranes, nails, and vagina, usually causing large, circular lesions. These infections seldom produce systemic symptoms but in late stages may\\nbe associated with recurrent respiratory tract infections. Other associated conditions include severe viral infections that may precede the onset of endocrinopathy and, sometimes, hepatitis. Involvement of the mouth, nose, and palate may cause speech and eating difficulties. Symptoms of endocrinopathy are peculiar to the organ involved. Tetany and hypocalcemia are most common and are associated with hypoparathyroidism. Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and pernicious anemia are also connected with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Psychiatric disorders are likely because of disfigurement and multiple endocrine aberrations. Diagnosis Laboratory findings usually show a normal circulating T-cell count, although it may be decreased. Skin tests don't usually show delayed hypersensitivity to Candida, even during the infectious stage. Migration inhibiting factor that indicates the presence of activated T cells may not respond to Candida. Nonimmunologic abnormalities resulting from endocrinopathy may include hypocalcemia, abnormal hepatic function studies, hyperglycemia, iron deficiency, and abnormal vitamin B12 absorption (pernicious anemia). Diagnosis must rule out other immunodeficiency disorders associated with chronic Candida infection, especially DiGeorge syndrome, ataxiatelangiectasia, and severe combined immunodeficiency disease, all of which produce severe immunologic defects. After diagnosis, the patient needs evaluation of adrenal, pituitary, thyroid, gonadal, pancreatic, and parathyroid function as well as careful follow-up. The disease is progressive, and most patients\\neventually develop endocrinopathy. Treatment Treatment aims to control infection but isn't always successful. Topical antifungal agents, such as clotrimazole, miconazole,\\nand nystatin, are useful. They may be prescribed as mouthwashes or troches (lozenges) for 5 to 10 days. Systemic infections may not be fatal, but they're serious\\nenough to warrant vigorous treatment. Ketoconazole and fluconazole have\\nhad some positive effect. Oral or I.M. iron replacement may also be necessary. Treatment may also include plastic surgery of the lesions, when possible, and counseling to help patients cope with their disfigurement. Special considerations Teach the patient about the disease's progressive manifestations and emphasize the importance of seeing an endocrinologist\\nfor regular checkups. Chronic fatigue syndrome Sometimes called chronic Epstein-Barr virus, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome is typically marked by debilitating fatigue, neurologic abnormalities, and persistent symptoms that suggest chronic mononucleosis. It commonly occurs in adults younger\\nthan age 45, primarily in women. Causes and incidence The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is unknown, but researchers suspect that it may be found in human herpes virus-6 or in other herpesviruses, enteroviruses, or retroviruses. Recent studies have shown that inflammation of nervous system pathways, acting as an immune or autoimmune response, may play a role as well. CFS may also be associated with a reaction to viral illness that's complicated by dysfunctional immune response and by other factors that may include gender, age, genetic disposition, prior illness, stress, and environment. Of the four million patients in the United States, less than 20% have been diagnosed. Signs and symptoms P CFS has specific symptoms and signs, based on the exclusion of other possible causes. Its characteristic symptom is prolonged, often overwhelming fatigue that's commonly associated with a varying complex of other symptoms that are similar to those of many infections, including myalgia and cephalgia. It may develop within a few\\nhours and can last for 6 months or more. Fatigue isn't relieved by rest\\nand is severe enough to restrict activities of daily living by at least\\n50%. Diagnosis Because the cause and nature of CFS are still unknown, no\\nsingle test unequivocally confirms its presence. Therefore, physicians base this diagnosis on the patient's history and the Centers for Disease\\nControl (CDC) criteria. (See Criteria for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome , page 492.)\\nBecause the CDC's criteria are admittedly a working concept that may not include all forms of this disease and are based on symptoms that can\\nresult from other diseases, diagnosis is difficult and uncertain. Treatment No treatment is known to cure CFS. Symptomatic treatment may involve the use of medications to treat depression, anxiety, pain, discomfort, and fever. Hidden yeast infections may be present and should\\nbe treated. Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and selected immunomodulating agents, such as I.V. gamma globulin, ampligen, and transfer factor, may be of assistance. CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME Because there is no blood test, brain scan, or other laboratory test to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), it's a diagnosis of exclusion. Following a detailed patient history, review of medications and laboratory screening tests, the physician should consider a diagnosis of CFS if two of these criteria are met: 1. Unexplained, persistent fatigue that's not\\ndue to ongoing exertion, isn't substantially relieved by rest, is of new onset (not lifelong) and results in a significant reduction in previous levels of activity. 2. Four or more of the following symptoms are present for six months or more: Impaired memory or concentration Postexertional malaise (extreme, prolonged exhaustion and sickness following physical or mental activity) Unrefreshing sleep Muscle pain Multijoint pain without swelling or redness Headaches or a new type or severity Sore throat that's frequent or recurring Tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes From: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/cfs/cfsdiagnosis.htm 9/6/07 Special considerations Some patients may benefit from avoiding environmental irritants and certain foods. Because patients with CFS may benefit from\\nsupportive contact with others who share this disease, refer the patient to the CFS Association for information and to local support groups. Patients may also benefit from psychological counseling. Chronic granulomatous disease In chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), abnormal neutrophil metabolism impairs phagocytosis \\u2014 one of the body's chief defense mechanisms \\u2014 resulting in increased susceptibility to low-virulent or P nonpathogenic organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus, and Nocardia. Phagocytes attracted to sites of infection can engulf these invading organisms but are unable to destroy them. Patients with CGD may develop granulomatous inflammation, which leads to ischemic tissue damage. Causes and incidence CGD is inherited as a recessive X-linked trait in 50% to 60% of affected patients. Males are more likely to be affected. The genetic defect may be linked to deficiency of the enzyme NADH, NADPH oxidase, or NADH reductase. The inability of phagocytic cells to kill certain bacteria and fungi leads to long-term and repeated infections. Signs and symptoms Usually, the patient with CGD displays signs and symptoms\\nassociated with infections of the skin, lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone by age 2. Skin infection is characterized by small, well-localized areas of tenderness. Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp and axilla is also common. Lymph node infection typically causes marked lymphadenopathy with draining lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Many patients develop liver abscess, which may be recurrent and multiple; abdominal tenderness, fever, anorexia, and nausea point to abscess formation. Other common infections include osteomyelitis, which causes localized pain and fever, pneumonia, and gingivitis with severe periodontal disease. Diagnosis Clinical features of osteomyelitis, pneumonia, liver abscess, or chronic lymphadenopathy in a young child provide the first clues to CGD diagnosis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An important tool for confirming this diagnosis is the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test. A clear yellow dye, NBT is normally reduced by neutrophil metabolism, resulting in a color change from yellow to blue. Quantifying this color change estimates the degree of neutrophil metabolism. Patients with CGD show impaired NBT reduction, indicating\\nabnormal neutrophil metabolism. Another test measures the rate of intracellular killing by neutrophils; in CGD, killing is delayed or absent. Other laboratory values may support the diagnosis or help\\nmonitor disease activity. Osteomyelitis typically causes elevated white\\nblood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; bone scans help locate and size such infections. Recurrent liver or lung infection may eventually cause abnormal function studies. Cell-mediated and humoral immunity are usually normal in CGD, although some patients have hypergammaglobulinemia. Treatment Early, aggressive treatment of infection is the chief goal in caring for a patient with CGD. Areas of suspected infection should be biopsied or cultured, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually started immediately \\u2014 without waiting for results of cultures. Confirmed abscesses may be drained or surgically removed. Provide meticulous wound care after such treatment, including irrigation or packing. Many patients with CGD receive a combination of I.V. antibiotics, in many cases extended beyond the usual 10- to 14-day course. However, for fungal infections with Aspergillus or Nocardia, treatment involves amphotericin B in gradually increasing doses to achieve a maximum cumulative dose. During I.V. drug therapy, monitor vital signs frequently and rotate the I.V. site every 48 to 72 hours. To help treat antibiotic-resistant or life-threatening infection, or to help localize infection, the patient may receive granulocyte transfusions \\u2014 usually once daily until the crisis has passed. During such transfusions, watch for fever and chills (these effects can sometimes be prevented by premedication with acetaminophen).\\nTransfusions shouldn't be given for 6 hours before or after amphotericin B to avoid severe pulmonary edema and, possibly, respiratory arrest. P Interferon-gamma may help reduce the number of severe infections. Bone marrow transplantation is also promising. Special considerations If prophylactic antibiotics are ordered, teach the patient and his family how to administer them properly and how\\nto recognize adverse effects. Advise them to promptly report any signs or symptoms of infection. Stress the importance of good nutrition and hygiene, especially meticulous skin and mouth care. During hospitalizations, encourage the patient to continue his activities of daily living as much as possible. If the patient is a child, arrange for a tutor to help him keep up with his schoolwork. Severe combined immunodeficiency disease In severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), both cell- mediated (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immunity are deficient or absent, resulting in susceptibility to infection from all classes of microorganisms during infancy. It's the most severe form of T-cell and B-cell deficiency. At least three types of SCID exist: reticular dysgenesis, the most severe type, in which the hematopoietic stem cell fails to differentiate into lymphocytes and granulocytes; Swiss-type agammaglobulinemia, in which the hematopoietic stem cell fails to differentiate into lymphocytes alone; and enzyme deficiency, such as adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, in which the buildup of toxic products in the lymphoid tissue causes damage and subsequent dysfunction. Causes and incidence SCID is usually transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, although it may be X-linked. In most cases, the genetic defect seems associated with failure of the stem cell to differentiate into T and B lymphocytes. Many molecular defects such as mutation of the kinase\\nZAP-70 can cause SCID. X-linked SCID is due to a mutation of a subunit of the interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-7 receptors. Less commonly, it results from an enzyme deficiency. SCID affects more males than females. Its estimated incidence is 1 in every 100,000 to 500,000 births. Most untreated patients die from infection within 1 year of birth. Complications Infection Pneumonia Oral ulcers Failure to thrive Dermatitis Signs and symptoms An extreme susceptibility to infection becomes obvious in\\nthe infant with SCID in the first months of life. The infant fails to thrive and develops chronic otitis; sepsis; watery diarrhea (associated with Salmonella or Escherichia coli ); recurrent pulmonary infections (usually caused by Pseudomonas, cytomegalovirus, or Pneumocystis jiroveci [formerly carinii ]); persistent oral candidiasis, sometimes with esophageal erosions; and possibly fatal viral infections such as chickenpox. P. jiroveci pneumonia usually\\nstrikes a severely immunodeficient infant in the first 3 to 5 weeks after birth. Onset is typically insidious, with gradually worsening cough, low-grade fever, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. Chest X-ray\\ncharacteristically shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Diagnosis Diagnosis is generally made clinically because most SCID infants suffer recurrent overwhelming infections within 1 year of birth.\\nSome infants are diagnosed after a severe reaction to vaccination. Defective humoral immunity is difficult to detect before age 5 months. Before then, even normal infants have very small amounts of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA. Normal IgG levels merely reflect maternal IgG. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Severely diminished or absent T-cell\\nnumber and function, as well as lymph node biopsy showing absence of lymphocytes, can confirm diagnosis of SCID. Treatment Treatment aims to restore the immune response and prevent\\ninfection. Histocompatible bone marrow transplantation is the only satisfactory treatment available to correct immunodeficiency. Because bone marrow cells must be human leukocyte antigen and mixed leukocyte culture matched, the most common donors are histocompatible siblings. However, because bone marrow transplant can produce a potentially fatal graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, newer methods of bone marrow transplant that eliminate GVH reaction (such as lectin separation and the use of monoclonal antibodies) are being evaluated. Fetal thymus and liver transplants have achieved limited success. Immune globulin administration may also play a role in treatment. Some SCID infants have received long-term protection by being\\nisolated in a completely sterile environment. However, this approach isn't effective if the infant already has had recurring infections. Gene therapy is being used to treat ADA deficiency. Special considerations Patient care is primarily preventive and supportive. Constantly monitor the infant for early signs of infection. If infection develops, provide prompt and aggressive\\ndrug therapy as ordered. Watch for adverse effects of any medications given. Avoid vaccinations and give only irradiated blood products if a transfusion is ordered. P Although SCID infants must remain in strict protective isolation, try to provide a stimulating atmosphere to promote growth and development. Encourage the parents to visit their child often, to hold him, and to bring him toys that can be easily sterilized. If the parents can't visit, call them often to report on the infant's condition. Explain all procedures, medications, and precautions to them.\\nMaintain a normal day and night routine for the child and talk to him as much as possible. Because the parents will have questions about the vulnerability of future offspring, refer them for genetic counseling. Arrange for psychological and spiritual support for the parents and siblings to help them cope with the child's inevitable long-term illness and early death. Complement deficiencies Complement is a series of circulating enzymatic serum proteins with nine functional components, labeled C1 through C9. (The first four complement components are numbered out of sequence, in order of their discovery \\u2014 C1, C4, C2, and C3 \\u2014 but the remaining five are numbered sequentially.) When immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM reacts with antigens as part of an immune response, it activates C1, which then combines with C4, initiating the classic complement pathway, or cascade.\\n(An alternative complement pathway involves the direct activation of C3\\nby the serum protein properdin, bypassing the initial components [C1, C4, and C2] of the classic pathway.) Complement then combines with the antigen-antibody complex and undergoes a sequence of reactions that amplify the immune response against the antigen. This complex process, which is vital to normal immune response, is called complement fixation; it's necessary to promote chemotaxis, opsonization, phagocytosis, bacteriolysis, and anaphylaxis reactions. Complement deficiency or dysfunction may increase susceptibility to infection and also seems related to certain autoimmune\\ndisorders. Theoretically, any complement component may be deficient or dysfunctional, and many such disorders are under investigation. Inherited or primary complement deficiencies are rare. The most common are C2, C4, C6, and C8 deficiencies and C5 familial dysfunction. More common secondary complement abnormalities have been confirmed in patients with lupus erythematosus, in some with dermatomyositis, in some\\nwith scleroderma, and in a few with gonococcal and meningococcal infections. The prognosis varies with the abnormality and the severity of associated diseases. Causes and incidence Primary complement deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, except for deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor, which is autosomal dominant. Secondary deficiencies may follow complement-fixing (complement-consuming) immunologic reactions, such as drug-induced serum sickness, acute streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and acute active systemic lupus erythematosus. Inherited deficiency is rare in the general population, with an incidence of 0.03%. C2 protein deficiency disorder occurs in 1 in 10,000 persons. Complications Systemic lupus erythematosus Glomerulonephritis Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis Signs and symptoms Clinical effects vary with the specific deficiency. C2 and C3 deficiencies and C5 familial dysfunction increase susceptibility to bacterial infection (which may involve several body systems simultaneously). C2 and C4 deficiencies are also associated with collagen vascular disease such as lupus erythematosus and with chronic renal failure. C5 dysfunction, a familial defect in infants, causes failure to thrive, diarrhea, and seborrheic dermatitis. C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema) may cause periodic swelling\\nin the face, hands, abdomen, or throat, with potentially fatal laryngeal edema. Diagnosis P Diagnosis of a complement deficiency is difficult, requiring careful interpretation of both clinical features and laboratory results. Total serum complement level CH50) is low in various\\ncomplement deficiencies. In addition, specific assays may be done to confirm deficiency of specific complement components. For example, detection of complement components and IgG by immunofluorescent examination of glomerular tissues in glomerulonephritis strongly suggests complement deficiency. Treatment Primary complement deficiencies have no known cure. Associated infection, collagen vascular disease, or renal disease requires prompt, appropriate treatment. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to provide replacement of complement components is controversial because replacement therapy doesn't cure complement deficiencies, and any beneficial effects are transient. A bone marrow transplant may be helpful but can cause a potentially fatal graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR). Anabolic steroids such as danazol and antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce acute swelling in patients with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Special considerations Teach the patient (or his family, if he's a\\nchild) the importance of avoiding infection, how to recognize its early\\nsigns and symptoms, and the need for prompt treatment if it occurs. After a bone marrow transplant, monitor the patient closely for signs of a transfusion reaction or GVHR. Meticulous patient care can speed recovery\\nand prevent complications. For example, a patient with renal infection needs careful monitoring of intake and output, tests for serum electrolytes and acid-base balance, and observation for signs of renal failure. When caring for a patient with hereditary angioedema, be prepared for emergency management of laryngeal edema; keep airway P : Title: Professional Guide to Diseases, 9th Edition Copyright \\u00a92009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins > Table of Contents > 9 - Hematologic disorders\"\n",

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction Blood, one of the body's major fluid tissues, continuously circulates through the heart and blood vessels, carrying vital elements to every part of the body. Blood basics Blood performs several vital functions through its special components: the liquid portion (plasma) and the formed constituents (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes) that are suspended in it. Erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) carry oxygen to the tissues and remove carbon dioxide from them. Leukocytes (white blood\\ncells [WBCs]) act in inflammatory and immune responses. Plasma (a clear, straw-colored fluid) carries antibodies and nutrients to tissues and carries waste away; plasma coagulation factors and thrombocytes (platelets) control clotting. (See Coagulation factors, page 498.) Typically, the average person has 5 to 6 L of circulating\\nblood, which constitute 5% to 7% of body weight (as much as 10% in premature neonates). Blood is three to five times more viscous than water, with an alkaline pH of 7.35 to 7.45, and is either bright red (arterial blood) or dark red (venous blood), depending on the degree of oxygen saturation and the hemoglobin (Hb) level. COAGULATION FACTORS Factor Synonym Location Factor I Fibrinogen Plasma Factor II Prothrombin Plasma Factor III Tissue thromboplastin Tissue cells Factor IV Calcium ion Plasma Factor V Labile factor Plasma Factor VII Stable factor Plasma Factor VIII Antihemophilic globulin or antihemophilic factor A Plasma Factor IX Plasma thromboplastin component, Christmas factor Plasma Factor X Stuart-Prower factor Plasma Factor XI Plasma thromboplastin antecedent Plasma Factor XII Hageman factor Plasma Factor XIII Fibrin stabilizing factor Plasma Formation and characteristics Hematopoiesis, the process of blood formation, occurs primarily in the bone marrow of the femur, sternum, and vertebrae, where\\nprimitive blood cells (stem cells) produce the precursors of erythrocytes (normoblasts), leukocytes, and thrombocytes. During embryonic development, blood cells are derived from mesenchyma and form in the yolk sac. As the fetus matures, blood cells are produced in the liver, the spleen, and the thymus; by the fifth month of gestation, blood cells also begin to form in bone marrow. After birth, blood cells are usually produced only in the marrow. Blood's function P The most important function of blood is to transport oxygen (bound to RBCs inside Hb) from the lungs to the body tissues and to return carbon dioxide from these tissues to the lungs. Blood also performs the following functions: production and delivery of antibodies (by WBCs) formed by plasma cells and lymphocytes transportation of granulocytes and monocytes to defend the body against pathogens by phagocytosis immunity against viruses and cancer cells through sensitized lymphocytes provision of complement, a group of immunologically important protein substances in plasma essential for immune and inflammatory responses. Blood's other functions include control of hemostasis by platelets, plasma, and coagulation factors that repair tissue injuries and prevent or halt bleeding; acid-base and fluid balance; regulation of\\nbody temperature by carrying off excess heat generated by the internal organs for dissipation through the skin; and transportation of nutrients and regulatory hormones to body tissues and of metabolic wastes to the organs of excretion (kidneys, lungs, and skin). Blood dysfunction Because of the rapid reproduction of bone marrow cells and the short life span and minimal storage in the bone marrow of circulating cells, bone marrow cells and their precursors are particularly vulnerable to physiologic changes that can affect cell production. Resulting blood disorders may be primary or secondary, quantitative or qualitative, or both; they may involve some or all blood\\ncomponents. Quantitative blood disorders result from increased or decreased cell production or cell destruction; qualitative blood disorders stem from intrinsic cell abnormalities or plasma component dysfunction. Specific causes of blood disorders include trauma, chronic disease, surgery, malnutrition, drugs, exposure to toxins and radiation,\\nand genetic and congenital defects that disrupt production and function. For example, depressed bone marrow production or mechanical destruction of mature blood cells can reduce the number of RBCs, platelets, and granulocytes, resulting in pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia). Increased production of multiple bone marrow components can follow myeloproliferative disorders. Erythropoiesis The tissues' demand for oxygen and the blood cells' ability to deliver it regulate RBC production. Consequently, hypoxia (or\\ntissue anoxia) stimulates RBC production by triggering the formation and release of erythropoietin, a hormone (probably produced by the kidneys) that activates bone marrow to produce RBCs. Erythropoiesis may also be stimulated by androgens (which accounts for higher RBC counts in\\nmen). RBCs have a life span of approximately 120 days. The actual formation of an erythrocyte begins with an uncommitted stem cell that may eventually develop into an RBC or a WBC. Such formation requires certain vitamins\\u2014B 12 and folic acid\\u2014and minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and especially iron, which is\\nvital to hemoglobin's oxygen-carrying capacity. Iron is obtained from various foods and is absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum, leaving\\nthe excess for temporary storage in reticuloendothelial cells, especially those in the liver. Iron excess is stored as ferritin and hemosiderin until it's released for use in the bone marrow to form new RBCs. ELDER TIP In older adults, fatty bone marrow replaces some active cell-forming marrow\\u2014first in the long bones and later in the flat bones. The altered bone marrow can't increase erythrocyte production as readily as before in response to such stimuli as hormones, anoxia, hemorrhage, and hemolysis. RBC disorders RBC disorders include quantitative and qualitative abnormalities. Deficiency of RBCs (anemia) can follow any condition that\\ndestroys or P inhibits the formation of these cells. Common factors leading to this deficiency include: chronic illnesses, such as renal disease, cancer, and chronic infections congenital or acquired defects that cause bone marrow aplasia and suppress general hematopoiesis (aplastic anemia)\\nor erythropoiesis deficiencies of vitamins (vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia) or minerals (iron, folic acid, copper, and cobalt deficiency anemias) that cause inadequate RBC production drugs, toxins, and ionizing radiation excessive chronic or acute blood loss (posthemorrhagic anemia) intrinsically or extrinsically defective red cells (sickle cell anemia and hemolytic transfusion reaction) metabolic abnormalities (sideroblastic anemia). Comparatively few conditions lead to excessive numbers of RBCs: abnormal proliferation of all bone marrow elements (polycythemia vera), especially RBC mass a single-element abnormality (for instance, an increase in RBCs that results from erythropoietin excess, which in turn results from hypoxemia, hypertension, or pulmonary disease) decreased plasma cell volume, which produces a corresponding relative increase in RBC concentration (such as\\nthrough the use of drugs). Function of WBCs WBCs, or leukocytes, protect the body against harmful bacteria and infection and are classified as granular leukocytes (basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils) or nongranular leukocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasma cells). (See Two types of leukocytes .)\\nUsually, WBCs are produced in bone marrow; lymphocytes and plasma cells\\nare produced in lymphoid tissue as well. Neutrophils have a circulating\\nhalf- life of less than 6 hours; some lymphocytes may survive for weeks or months. Normally, WBCs number between 5,000 and 10,000/\\u00b5l. There are six types of WBCs: Neutrophils, the predominant form of granulocyte, make up about 60% of WBCs; they help devour invading organisms by phagocytosis. Eosinophils, minor granulocytes, may defend against parasites and lung and skin infections and act in allergic reactions. They account for 1% to 5% of the total WBC count. Basophils, minor granulocytes, may release heparin and histamine into the blood and\\nparticipate in delayed hypersensitivity reactions. They account for 0% to 1% of the total WBC count. Monocytes, along with neutrophils, help devour invading organisms by phagocytosis. They help process antigens for lymphocytes and form macrophages in the tissues; they account for 1% to 6% of the total WBC count. Lymphocytes occur as B cells and T cells. B cells aid antibody synthesis; T cells regulate cell-mediated immunity. They account for 20% to 40% of the total WBC count. Plasma cells develop from lymphocytes, reside in the tissue, and produce antibodies. A temporary increase in production and release of mature WBCs (leukemic reaction) is a normal response to infection. However, an excessive number of immature WBC precursors and their accumulation in bone marrow or lymphoid tissue is characteristic of leukemia. These nonfunc-tioning WBCs (blasts) provide no protection against infection; crowd out RBCs, platelets, and mature WBCs; and spill into the bloodstream, sometimes infiltrating organs and impairing function. WBC deficiencies may reflect inadequate cell production, drug reactions, ionizing radiation, infiltrated bone marrow (cancer), congenital defects, aplastic anemia, folic acid deficiency, or hypersplenism. The major WBC deficiencies are granulocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, and monocytopenia. Platelets, plasma, and clotting P Platelets are small (2 to 4 microns in diameter), colorless, disk-shaped cytoplasmic fragments split from cells in bone marrow called megakaryocytes. The normal platelet concentration is 150,000 to 400,000/\\u00b5l. These fragments, which have a life span of approximately 10 days, perform three vital functions: initiate vasoconstriction of damaged blood vessels to minimize blood loss form hemostatic plugs in injured blood vessels with plasma, provide materials that accelerate blood coagulation\\u2014 notably platelet factor 3. Plasma consists mainly of proteins (chiefly albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen) held in aqueous suspension. Other components of plasma include glucose, lipids, amino acids, electrolytes, pigments, hormones, respiratory gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), and products of metabolism, such as urea, uric acid, creatinine, and lactic acid. Its fluid characteristics\\u2014 including osmotic pressure, viscosity, and suspension qualities\\u2014depend on its protein content. Plasma components regulate acid-base balance and immune responses and mediate coagulation and nutrition. In a complex process called hemostasis, platelets, plasma, and coagulation factors interact to control bleeding. Hemostasis and the clotting mechanism Hemostasis is the complex process by which the body controls bleeding. When a blood vessel ruptures, local vasoconstriction and platelet clumping (aggregation) at the injury site initially help prevent hemorrhage. This activation of the coagulation system, called extrinsic cascade, requires release of tissue thromboplastin from the damaged cells. However, formation of a\\nmore stable clot requires initiation of the complex clotting mechanism known as the intrinsic cascade system. When endothelial vessel injury or a foreign body in the bloodstream activates this system, activating factor XII triggers clotting. In the final common pathway, prothrombin is converted to thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, which is necessary for creation of a fibrin clot. TWO TYPES OF LEUKOCYTES Leukocytes vary in size, shape, and number. Granular leukocytes Granular leukocytes (granulocytes) are the most numerous and include basophils, containing cytoplasmic granules that stain readily with alkaline dyes; eosinophils, which stain with acidic dyes; and neutrophils, which are finely granular and recognizable by their multinucleated appearance. Nongranular leukocytes Lymphocytes and monocytes have few, if any, granulated particles in the cytoplasm. P Therapy with blood components Because of improved methods of collection, component separation, and storage, blood transfusions are being used more effectively than ever. Separating blood into components permits a single\\nunit of blood to benefit several patients with different hematologic abnormalities. Component therapy allows replacement of a specific blood component without risking reactions from other components. Blood typing, crossmatching, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are compatibility tests used to ensure safe, effective replacement therapy and minimize the risk of transfusion reactions. Blood typing determines the antigens present in the patient's RBCs by reaction with standardized sera. (Critical antigen groups are those of ABO and Rh factor.) Crossmatching the patient's blood with transfusion blood provides some assurance that the patient doesn't have antibodies against donor red cells. HLA typing may be helpful for the patient who needs long-term transfusion therapy or frequent platelet transfusions, but usually, only family members can provide an appropriate match because antigenic properties are genetically determined. Bone marrow transplantation Bone marrow transplantation is used to treat acute leukemia, aplastic anemia, severe combined immunodeficiency disease, Nezelof syndrome, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. In this procedure, marrow from a twin or another HLA-identical donor (usually a sibling) is\\ntransfused in an attempt to repopulate the recipient's bone marrow with\\nnormal cells. A hematologic disorder can affect nearly every aspect of the patient's life, perhaps resulting in life-threatening emergencies that require prompt medical treatment. Astute, sensitive care founded on\\na firm understanding of hematologic basics can help the patient survive\\nsuch illnesses. In situations with poor prognoses, the patient may need\\nto make many adjustments to maintain an optimal quality of life. ANEMIAS Pernicious anemia Pernicious anemia, also known as Addison's anemia, is a megaloblastic anemia characterized by decreased gastric production\\nof hydrochloric acid and deficiency of intrinsic factor (IF), a substance normally secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa that's essential for vitamin B 12 absorption in the ileum. The resulting deficiency of vitamin B 12 causes serious neurologic, gastric, and intestinal abnormalities. Untreated pernicious anemia may lead to permanent neurologic disability and death. Causes and incidence Familial incidence of pernicious anemia suggests a genetic predisposition. (It may involve an inherited single dominant autosomal factor.) Significantly higher incidence in patients with immunologically related diseases, such as thyroiditis, myxedema, and Graves' disease, seems to support a widely held theory that an inherited\\nautoimmune response causes gastric mucosal atrophy and, therefore, deficiency of hydrochloric acid and IF. IF deficiency impairs vitamin B 12 absorption. The resultant vitamin B 12 deficiency inhibits cell growth, particularly of red blood cells (RBCs), leading to insufficient and deformed RBCs with poor oxygen-carrying capacity. It also impairs myelin formation, causing neurologic damage. Iatrogenic induction can follow partial gastrectomy. PEDIATRIC TIP P Juvenile pernicious anemia, occurring in children younger than age 10, stems from a congenital stomach disorder that causes secretion of abnormal IF. ELDER TIP With age, vitamin B 12 absorption may also diminish, resulting in reduced erythrocyte mass and decreased hemoglobin (Hb) levels and hematocrit (HCT). Pernicious anemia primarily affects people of northern European ancestry. It's rare in children and infants. Onset typically occurs after age 35, and incidence increases with age. It affects about 2% of people older than age 60. Complications Paralysis Psychotic behavior Sphinctor control loss of bowel and bladder Signs and symptoms Characteristically, pernicious anemia has an insidious onset but eventually causes an unmistakable triad of symptoms: weakness,\\nsore tongue, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. The lips, gums, and tongue appear markedly bloodless. Hemolysis-induced hyperbilirubinemia may cause faintly jaundiced sclera and pale to bright yellow skin. In addition, the patient may become highly susceptible to infection, especially of the genitourinary tract. Other systemic symptoms of pernicious anemia include the following: GI\\u2014 Gastric mucosal atrophy and decreased hydrochloric acid production disturb digestion and lead to nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, flatulence, diarrhea, and constipation. Gingival bleeding and tongue inflammation may hinder eating and intensify anorexia. Central nervous system (CNS) \\u2014Demyelination caused by vitamin B 12 deficiency initially affects the peripheral nerves but gradually extends to the spinal cord. Consequently, the neurologic effects of pernicious anemia may include neuritis; weakness in extremities; peripheral numbness and paresthesia; disturbed position sense; lack of coordination; ataxia; impaired fine finger movement; positive Babinski's\\nand Romberg's signs; lightheadedness; altered vision (diplopia and blurred vision), taste, and hearing (tinnitus); optic muscle atrophy; loss of bowel and bladder control; and, in males, impotence. Its effects\\non the nervous system may also produce irritability, poor memory, headache, depression, and delirium. Although some of these symptoms are temporary, irreversible CNS changes may have occurred before treatment. Cardiovascular\\u2014 Increasingly\\nfragile cell membranes induce widespread destruction of RBCs, resulting\\nin low Hb levels. The impaired oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood secondary to lowered Hb leads to weakness, fatigue, and light-headedness. Compensatory increased cardiac output results in palpitations, wide pulse pressure, dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia, premature beats and, eventually, heart failure. Musculoskeletal\\u2014 Scissors gait can also occur as a late sign of untreated anemia. Diagnosis A positive family history, typical ethnic heritage, and results of blood studies, bone marrow aspiration, gastric analysis, and the Schilling test establish the diagnosis. (See Tests for blood composition, production, and function, pages 504 and 505.)\\nLaboratory screening must rule out other anemias with similar symptoms,\\nsuch as folic acid deficiency anemia, because treatment differs. Diagnosis must also rule out vitamin B 12 deficiency resulting from malabsorption due to GI disorders, gastric surgery, radiation, or drug therapy. Blood study results that suggest pernicious anemia include: decreased Hb levels (4 to 5 g/dl) and decreased RBC count ELDER TIP P Hb levels drop 1 to 2 g/dl in elderly men, and HCT may decrease slightly in both men and women. These changes reflect decreased bone marrow and hematopoiesis and (in men) decreased androgen levels; they aren't an indicator of pernicious anemia. increased mean corpuscular volume (greater than 120/\\u00b5l); because larger-than-normal RBCs each contain increased amounts of Hb, mean corpuscular Hb concentration is also increased possible low white blood cell and platelet counts and large, malformed platelets serum vitamin B 12 assay levels less than 0.1 mcg/ml elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Bone marrow aspiration reveals erythroid hyperplasia (crowded red bone marrow), with increased numbers of megaloblasts but few normally developing RBCs. Gastric analysis shows absence of free hydrochloric acid after histamine or pentagastrin injection. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The Schilling test is the definitive\\ntest for pernicious anemia. In this test, the patient receives a small oral dose (0.5 to 2 mcg) of radioactive vitamin B 12 after fasting for 12 hours. A larger dose (1 mg) of nonradioactive vitamin B 12 is given I.M. 2 hours later, as a parenteral flush, and the radioactivity of a 24-hour urine specimen is measured. About 7% of the radioactive B 12 dose is excreted in the first 24 hours; people with pernicious anemia excrete less than 3%. (In pernicious anemia, the vitamin remains unabsorbed and is passed in the stool.) When\\nthe Schilling test is repeated with IF added, the test shows normal excretion of vitamin B 12 . TESTS FOR BLOOD COMPOSITION, PRODUCTION, AND FUNCTION Overall composition Peripheral blood smear shows maturity and morphologic characteristics of blood elements and determines qualitative\\nabnormalities. Complete blood count determines the actual number of blood elements in relation to volume and quantifies abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy allows evaluation of hematopoiesis by showing blood elements and precursors, and abnormal or malignant cells. Red blood cell function Hematocrit, or packed cell volume, measures the percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) per fluid volume of whole blood. Hemoglobin (Hb) measures the amount (grams) of Hb per deciliter of blood, to determine oxygen-carrying capacity. Reticulocyte count assesses RBC production by determining concentration of this erythrocyte precursor. Schilling test determines absorption of vitamin B 12 (necessary for erythropoiesis) by measuring excretion of radioactive B 12 in the urine. Mean corpuscular volume describes the RBC in terms of size. Mean corpuscular Hb determines the average amount of Hb per RBC. Mean corpuscular Hb concentration establishes the average Hb concentration in 1 dl of packed RBCs. Sucrose hemolysis test assesses the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolyze with complement. Direct Coombs' test demonstrates the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (such as antibodies to Rh factor) or, possibly, complement on circulating RBCs. Indirect Coombs' test, a two-step test, detects the presence of IgG antibodies in the serum. Sideroblast test detects stainable iron (available for Hb synthesis) in normoblastic RBCs. Hb electrophoresis demonstrates abnormal Hb such as sickle cell. Hemostasis Platelet count determines the number of platelets. Bleeding time (Ivy bleeding time) assesses the capacity for platelets to stop bleeding in capillaries and small vessels. Prothrombin time (Quick's test, pro time) assists in evaluation of thrombin generation (extrinsic clotting mechanism). Partial thromboplastin time aids evaluation of the adequacy of plasma-clotting factors (intrinsic clotting mechanism). International Normalized Ratio (INR) normalizes ratios between labs. Fibrin degradation products (fibrin split products, FDPs) test the amount of clot breakdown products in serum. Thrombin time detects abnormalities in thrombin fibrinogen reaction. Fibrinogen (factor I) measures this coagulation factor in plasma. D-dimer test determines if FDPs are from normal mechanisms or excessive fibrinolysis and is commonly used to diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation. White blood cell function White blood cell (WBC) count, differential\\nestablishes quantity and maturity of WBC elements (neutrophils [called polymorphonuclear granulocytes or bands], basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes). Quantified CD4 + :CD8 + T lymphocytes determines helper:suppressor ratio important to immune function with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Plasma Erythrocyte sedimentation rate measures the rate of RBCs settling from plasma and may reflect infection. Electrophoresis of serum proteins determines the amount of various serum proteins (classified by mobility in response to an electrical field). It's commonly used to diagnose plasma cell myeloma. Immunoelectrophoresis of serum proteins separates and classifies serum antibodies (immunoglobulins) through specific antisera. Important serologic findings may include IF antibodies and antiparietal cell antibodies. Treatment Early parenteral vitamin B 12 replacement can reverse pernicious anemia, minimize complications and, possibly, prevent\\npermanent neurologic damage. An initial high dose of parenteral vitamin\\nB 12 causes rapid RBC regeneration. Within 2 weeks, Hb levels\\nshould rise to normal, and the patient's condition should markedly improve. Because rapid cell regeneration increases the patient's iron and folate requirements, P concomitant iron and folic acid replacement is necessary to prevent iron deficiency anemia. After the patient's condition improves, the vitamin B 12 dosage can be decreased to maintenance levels and given monthly. Because such injections must be continued for life, the patient should learn self- administration of vitamin B 12 . If anemia causes extreme fatigue, the patient may require\\nbed rest until Hb levels rise. If Hb levels are dangerously low, he may\\nneed blood transfusions. Digoxin (Lanoxin), a diuretic, and a low-sodium diet may be necessary for a patient with heart failure. Most important is the replacement of vitamin B 12 to control the condition that led to this failure. Antibiotics help combat accompanying infections. Special considerations Supportive measures minimize the risk of complications and speed recovery. Patient and family teaching can promote compliance with lifelong vitamin B 12 replacement. If the patient has severe anemia, plan activities, rest periods, and necessary diagnostic tests to conserve his\\nenergy. Monitor pulse rate often; tachycardia means his activities are too strenuous. To ensure accurate Schilling test results,\\nmake sure that all urine over a 24-hour period is collected and that the specimens are uncontaminated. Warn the patient to guard against infections and tell him to report signs of infection promptly, especially pulmonary and urinary tract infections, because the patient's\\nweakened condition may increase susceptibility. Provide a well-balanced diet, including foods high in vitamin B 12 (meat, liver, fish, eggs, and milk). Offer between-meal snacks and encourage the family to bring favorite foods from home. Because a sore mouth and tongue make eating painful, ask the dietitian to avoid giving the patient irritating\\nfoods. If these symptoms make talking difficult, supply a pad and pencil or some other aid to P facilitate nonverbal communication; explain this problem to the family. Provide diluted mouthwash or, with severe conditions, swab the patient's mouth with tap water or warm saline solution or use topical anesthetic mouthwash. Warn the patient with a sensory deficit not to use a heating pad, because it may cause burns. If the patient is incontinent, establish a\\nregular bowel and bladder routine. After the patient is discharged, a home health care nurse should follow up on this schedule and make adjustments, as needed. If neurologic damage causes behavioral problems, assess mental and neurologic status often; if needed, give tranquilizers, as ordered, and apply wrist or jacket restraint and utilize bed alert alarm at night. Stress that vitamin B 12 replacement isn't a permanent cure and that these injections must be continued for life, even after symptoms subside. PREVENTING FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid, folacin) is found in most body tissues, where it acts as a coenzyme in metabolic processes involving one carbon transfer. It's essential for formation and maturation of red blood cells and for synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid. Although its body stores are relatively small (about 70 mg), this vitamin is plentiful in most well-balanced diets. However, because folic acid is water-soluble and heat- labile, it's easily destroyed by cooking. Also, approximately 20% of folic acid intake is excreted unabsorbed. Insufficient daily folic acid intake (less than 50 mcg/ day) usually induces folic acid deficiency within 4 months. To prevent folic acid deficiency anemia, foods high in folic acid content should be chosen, such as those listed below: Food mcg/100 g Asparagus spears 109 Beef liver 294 Broccoli spears 54 Collards (cooked) 102 Mushrooms 24 Oatmeal 33 Peanut butter 57 Red beans 180 Wheat germ 305 PREVENTION To prevent pernicious anemia, emphasize the importance of vitamin B 12 supplements for patients who have had extensive gastric resections or who follow strict vegetarian or vegan diets. Folic acid deficiency anemia Folic acid deficiency anemia is a common, slowly progressive, megaloblastic anemia. It usually occurs in infants, adolescents, pregnant and lactating females, alcoholics, elderly people,\\nand people with malignant or intestinal diseases. Causes and incidence Folic acid deficiency anemia may result from: alcohol abuse (alcohol may suppress metabolic effects of folate) poor diet (common in alcoholics, elderly people living alone, and infants, especially those with infections or diarrhea) P impaired absorption (due to intestinal dysfunction from disorders such as celiac disease, tropical sprue, regional jejunitis, or bowel resection) bacteria competing for available folic acid excessive cooking, which can destroy a high percentage of folic acids in foods (See Preventing folic acid deficiency anemia. ) limited storage capacity in infants prolonged drug therapy (anticonvulsants and estrogens) increased folic acid requirements during pregnancy; during rapid growth in infancy (common because of recent increase in survival of premature infants); during childhood and adolescence (because of general use of folate-poor cow's milk); and in patients with neoplastic diseases and some skin diseases (chronic exfoliative dermatitis). It's estimated that 10% of the United States population has low folate stores. Signs and symptoms Folic acid deficiency anemia gradually produces clinical features characteristic of other megaloblastic anemias, without the neurologic manifestations: progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, weakness, glossitis, nausea, anorexia, headache, fainting,\\nirritability, forgetfulness, pallor, and slight jaundice. Folic acid deficiency anemia doesn't cause neurologic impairment unless it's associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency, as in pernicious anemia. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The Schilling test and a therapeutic trial of vitamin B 12 injections distinguish between folic acid deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia. Significant findings include macrocytosis, decreased reticulocyte count, abnormal platelets, and serum folate less than 3 ng/ml. Treatment Treatment consists primarily of folic acid supplements and elimination of contributing causes. Folic acid supplements may be given orally or parenterally (to patients who are severely ill, have malabsorption, or are unable to take oral medication). Many patients respond favorably to a well-balanced diet. If the patient has combined B 12 and folate deficiencies, folic acid replenishment alone may aggravate neurologic dysfunction. Special considerations Teach the patient to meet daily folic acid\\nrequirements by including a food from each food group in every meal. If\\nhe has a severe deficiency, explain that diet only reinforces folic acid supplementation and isn't therapeutic by itself. Urge compliance with the prescribed course of therapy. Advise him not to stop taking the\\nsupplements when he begins to feel better. If the patient has glossitis, emphasize the importance of good oral hygiene. Suggest regular use of mild or diluted mouthwash and a soft toothbrush. Watch fluid and electrolyte balance, particularly in the patient who has severe diarrhea and is receiving parenteral fluid replacement therapy. Because anemia causes severe fatigue, schedule regular rest periods until the patient is able to resume normal activity. PREVENTION Emphasize the importance of a well-balanced diet high in folic acid. Identify alcoholics with poor dietary habits and try to arrange for appropriate counseling. Tell mothers who aren't breast-feeding to use commercially prepared formulas. P Aplastic anemias Aplastic, or hypoplastic, anemias result from injury to or destruction of stem cells in bone marrow or the bone marrow matrix, causing pancytopenia (anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia) and bone marrow hypoplasia. Although commonly used interchangeably with other terms for bone marrow failure, aplastic anemias properly refer to pancytopenia resulting from the decreased functional capacity of a hypoplastic, fatty bone marrow. These disorders generally produce fatal bleeding or infection, particularly when they're idiopathic or stem from chloramphenicol or from infectious hepatitis. Mortality for aplastic anemias with severe pancytopenia is 80% to 90%. Causes and incidence Aplastic anemias usually develop when damaged or destroyed stem cells inhibit red blood cell (RBC) production. Less commonly, they develop when damaged bone marrow microvasculature creates\\nan unfavorable environment for cell growth and maturation. About one-half of such anemias result from drugs (antibiotics, anticonvulsants, anti- inflammatory drugs, an-tineoplastics, diuretics, phenothiazines, antidiabetics, and antithyroid drugs), toxic agents (such as benzene and chloramphenicol), or radiation. The rest may result\\nfrom immunologic factors (unconfirmed), severe disease (especially hepatitis), viral infection (especially in children), or preleukemic and\\nneoplastic infiltration of bone marrow. Idiopathic anemias may be congenital. Two such forms of aplastic anemia have been identified: Congenital hypoplastic anemia (Blackfan- Diamond anemia) develops between ages 2 and 3 months; Fanconi's syndrome, between birth and age 10. In Fanconi's syndrome, chromosomal abnormalities are usually associated with multiple congenital anomalies, such as dwarfism, and hypoplasia of the kidneys and spleen. In the absence of a consistent familial or genetic history of aplastic anemia, researchers suspect that these congenital abnormalities result from an induced change in the fetus' development. BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION In bone marrow transplantation, usually 500 to 700 ml of marrow is aspirated from the pelvic bones of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible donor (allogeneic) or of the recipient himself during complete remission (autologous). The aspirated marrow is filtered and then infused into the recipient in an attempt to repopulate the patient's marrow with normal cells. This procedure has effected long-term, healthy survival in about 50% of patients with severe aplastic anemia. Bone marrow transplantation may also be effective in patients with acute leukemia, certain immunodeficiency diseases, and solid tumor neoplasms. Because bone marrow transplantation carries serious risks, it requires strict adherence to infection control and strict sterile techniques, and a primary nurse to provide consistent care and continuous monitoring of the patient's status. Before transplantation Explain that the success rate depends on the stage of the disease and an HLA-identical match. After bone marrow aspiration is completed under local anesthetic, apply pressure dressings to the donor's aspiration sites. Observe the sites for bleeding. Relieve pain with analgesics and ice packs, as needed. Assess the patient's understanding of bone\\nmarrow transplantation. If necessary, correct any misconceptions about this procedure and provide additional information, as appropriate. Prepare the patient to expect an extended hospital stay. Explain that chemotherapy and possible radiation treatments are necessary to destroy cells that may cause the body to reject the transplant. Various treatment protocols are used. For example, I.V. cyclophosphamide may be used with additional chemotherapeutic agents or total body irradiation and requires aggressive hydration to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis. Control nausea and\\nvomiting with an antiemetic, such as ondansetron, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or lorazepam, as needed. Give allopurinol, as prescribed, to prevent hyperuricemia resulting from tumor breakdown products. Because alopecia is a common adverse effect of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy, encourage the patient to choose a wig or scarf\\nbefore treatment begins. Total body irradiation may follow chemotherapy, inducing total marrow aplasia. Warn the patient that cataracts, GI disturbances, and sterility are possible adverse effects. Assess venous access. If necessary, the patient may have an indwelling central venous catheter inserted. During marrow infusion Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes. Watch for complications of marrow infusion, such as pulmonary embolus, hypersensitivity reactions, and volume overload. Reassure the patient throughout the procedure. After the infusion Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs every 15 minutes for 2 hours after infusion, then every 4 hours. Watch for fever and chills, which may be the only signs of infection. Give prophylactic antibiotics as prescribed. To reduce the possibility of bleeding, don't administer medications rectally or I.M. P Administer methotrexate or cyclosporine, as prescribed, to prevent graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, a potentially fatal complication of allogeneic transplantation. Watch for signs or symptoms of GVH reaction, such as maculopapular rash, pancytopenia, jaundice, joint pain, and generalized edema. Administer vitamins, steroids, and iron and folic acid supplements, as appropriate. Administration of blood products, such as platelets and packed red blood cells, may also be indicated, depending on the results of daily blood studies. Provide good mouth care every 2 hours. Use\\nhydrogen peroxide and nystatin mouthwash or oral fluconazole, for example, to prevent candidiasis and other mouth infections. Also provide\\nmeticulous skin care, paying special attention to pressure points and open sites, such as aspiration and I.V. Incidence is 0.6 to 6.1 cases per 1 million people in the United States. There is no racial predilection. Complications Life-threatening hemorrhage Secondary opportunistic infections Signs and symptoms Clinical features of aplastic anemias vary with the severity of pancytopenia but develop insidiously in many cases. Anemic symptoms include progressive weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, pallor and, ultimately, tachycardia and heart failure. Thrombocytopenia leads to ecchymosis, petechiae, and hemorrhage, especially from the mucous membranes (nose, gums, rectum, and vagina) or into the retina or central\\nnervous system. Neutropenia may lead to infection (fever, oral and rectal ulcers, and sore throat) but without characteristic inflammation. Diagnosis Confirmation of aplastic anemia requires a series of laboratory tests: RBCs are usually normochromic and normocytic (although macrocytosis [larger-than-normal erythrocytes] and anisocytosis [excessive variation in erythrocyte size] may exist), with a\\ntotal count of 1 million/\\u00b5l or less. Absolute reticulocyte count is very low. Serum iron level is elevated (unless bleeding occurs), but total iron- binding capacity is normal or slightly reduced. Hemosiderin (a derivative of hemoglobin [Hb]) is present, and tissue iron storage is visible microscopically. Platelet, neutrophil, and white blood cell counts fall. Coagulation tests (bleeding time), reflecting decreased platelet count, are abnormal. Bone marrow aspiration from several sites may yield a \\u201cdry tap,\\u201d and biopsy will show severely hypocellular or aplastic marrow, with varied amounts of fat, fibrous tissue, or gelatinous replacement; absence of tagged iron (because iron is deposited in the liver rather than bone marrow) and megakaryocytes (platelet precursors); and depression of erythroid elements. Differential diagnosis must rule out paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other diseases in which pancytopenia is common. Treatment Effective treatment must eliminate any identifiable cause\\nand provide vigorous supportive measures, such as packed RBC, platelet,\\nand experimental histocompatibility locus antigen-matched leukocyte transfusions. Even after elimination of the cause, recovery can take P months. Bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for anemia due to severe aplasia and for patients who need constant RBC transfusions. (See Bone marrow transplantation .) Patients with low leukocyte counts need special measures to prevent infection. The infection itself may require specific antibiotics; however, these aren't given prophylactically because they tend to encourage resistant strains of organisms. Patients with low Hb levels may need respiratory support with oxygen in addition to blood transfusions. For older patients, or for those who don't have a matched\\nbone marrow donor, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is an alternative treatment. ATG is a horse serum that contains antibodies against human T\\ncells. It may be used in an attempt to suppress the body's immune system, allowing the bone marrow to resume its blood cellgenerating function. Other immunosuppressant agents, such as cyclosporine, may also\\nbe used. Other treatments may include corticosteroids to stimulate\\nerythroid production, marrow-stimulating agents such as androgens (which remain controversial), and colony stimulation factors to encourage growth of specific cellular components. Special considerations If the platelet count is low (less than 20,000/\\u00b5l), prevent bleeding by avoiding I.M. injections, suggesting the\\nuse of an electric razor and a soft toothbrush, humidifying oxygen to prevent drying of mucous membranes, avoiding enemas and rectal temperatures, and promoting regular bowel movements through the use of a\\nstool softener and a proper diet to prevent constipation. Also, apply pressure to venipuncture sites until bleeding stops. Detect bleeding early by checking for blood in urine and stool, and assessing skin for petechiae. Take safety precautions to prevent falls that could lead to prolonged bleeding or hemorrhage. Help prevent infection by washing your hands thoroughly before entering the patient's room, by making sure he's\\nreceiving a nutritious diet (high in vitamins and proteins) to improve his resistance, and by encouraging meticulous mouth and perianal care. Watch for life-threatening hemorrhage, infection, adverse effects of drug therapy, or blood transfusion reaction. Make sure routine throat, urine, nose, rectal, and blood cultures are done regularly and correctly to check for infection. Teach the patient to recognize signs of infection, and tell him to report them\\nimmediately. If the patient has a low Hb level, which causes fatigue, schedule frequent rest periods. Administer oxygen therapy as needed. If blood transfusions are necessary, assess for a transfusion reaction by checking the patient's temperature and watching for the development of other signs and symptoms, such as rash, hives, itching, back pain, restlessness, and shaking chills. Reassure and support the patient and his family by explaining the disease and its treatment, particularly if he has recurring acute episodes. Explain the purpose of all prescribed drugs and discuss possible adverse effects, including which ones he should report promptly. Encourage the patient who doesn't require hospitalization to continue his normal lifestyle, with appropriate restrictions (such as regular rest periods), until remission occurs. To prevent aplastic anemia, monitor blood studies carefully in the patient receiving anemia-inducing drugs. Support efforts to educate the public about the hazards of toxic agents. Tell parents to keep toxic agents out\\nof the reach of children. Encourage people who work with radiation to wear protective clothing and a radiation-detecting badge, and to observe\\nplant safety precautions. Those who work with benzene (solvent) should know that 10 parts per million is the highest safe environmental level and that a delayed reaction to benzene may develop. Sideroblastic anemias Sideroblastic anemias are a group of heterogenous disorders with a common defect; they fail to use iron in hemoglobin (Hb)\\nsynthesis, despite the availability of adequate iron stores. These anemias may be hereditary or acquired; the acquired form, in turn, can be primary or P secondary. Hereditary sideroblastic anemia commonly responds to treatment with pyridoxine. Correction of the secondary acquired form depends on the causative disorder; the primary acquired (idiopathic) form, however, resists treatment and usually proves fatal within 10 years after onset of complications or a concomitant disease. Causes and incidence Hereditary sideroblastic anemia appears to be transmitted\\nby X-linked inheritance, occurring mostly in young males; females are carriers and usually show no signs of this disorder. The acquired form may be secondary to ingestion of or exposure to toxins, such as alcohol and lead, or to certain drugs. It can also occur as a complication of other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, tuberculosis, and severe infections. The primary acquired form, known as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, is most common in elderly people. It's commonly associated with thrombocytopenia or leukopenia as part of a myelodysplastic syndrome. In sideroblastic anemia, normoblasts fail to use iron to synthesize Hb. As a result, iron is deposited in the mitochondria of normoblasts, which are then termed ringed sideroblasts. Complications Severe cardiac, hepatic, and pancreatic disease Respiratory complications Signs and symptoms Sideroblastic anemias usually produce nonspecific clinical effects, which may exist for several years before being identified. Such effects include anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness,\\npale skin and mucous membranes and, occasionally, enlarged lymph nodes.\\nHeart and liver failure may develop due to excessive iron accumulation in these organs, causing dyspnea, exertional angina, slight jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. Hereditary sideroblastic anemia is associated with increased GI absorption of iron, causing signs of hemosiderosis. Additional symptoms in secondary sideroblastic anemia depend upon the underlying cause. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Ringed sideroblasts on microscopic examination of bone marrow aspirate, stained with Prussian blue or alizarin red dye, confirm this diagnosis. (See Ringed sideroblast.) RINGED SIDEROBLAST Electron microscopy shows large iron deposits in the mitochondria that surround the nucleus, forming the characteristic ringed sideroblast. Microscopic examination of blood shows erythrocytes to be\\nhypochromic or normochromic and slightly macrocytic. Red cell precursors may be megaloblastic, with anisocytosis (abnormal variation in red blood cell [RBC] size) and poikilocytosis (abnormal variation in RBC shape). Unlike iron deficiency anemia, sideroblastic anemia lowers Hb levels and raises serum iron and transferrin levels. In turn, faulty Hb production raises urobilinogen and bilirubin levels. Platelets and leukocytes remain normal, but, occasionally, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia occurs. P Treatment Treatment of sideroblastic anemias depends on the underlying cause. The hereditary form usually responds to several weeks of treatment with high doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ). The acquired secondary form generally subsides after the causative drug or toxin is removed, or the underlying condition is adequately treated. Folic acid supplements may also be beneficial when concomitant megaloblastic nuclear changes in RBC precursors are present. Elderly patients with sideroblastic anemia (usually the primary acquired form) are less likely to improve quickly and are more likely to develop serious complications. Deferoxamine may be used to treat chronic iron overload in selected patients. Carefully crossmatched transfusions (providing needed Hb)\\nor high doses of androgens are effective palliative measures for some patients with the primary acquired form of sideroblastic anemia. However, this form is essentially refractory to treatment and usually leads to death from acute leukemia or from respiratory or cardiac complications. Some patients with sideroblastic anemia may benefit from phlebotomy to prevent hemochromatosis (the accumulation of iron in body tissues). Phlebotomy steps up the rate of erythropoiesis and uses up excess iron stores; thus, it reduces serum and total-body iron levels. Special considerations Administer medications as indicated. Teach\\nthe patient the importance of continuing prescribed therapy, even after\\nhe begins to feel better. Provide frequent rest periods if the patient becomes easily fatigued. If phlebotomy is scheduled, explain the procedure thoroughly to help reduce anxiety. If this procedure must be repeated frequently, provide a high-protein diet to help replace the protein lost during phlebotomy. Encourage the patient to follow a similar diet at home. Always inquire about the possibility of exposure to lead in the home (especially for children) or on the job. Identify patients who abuse alcohol; refer them for appropriate therapy. Thalassemia Thalassemia, a hereditary group of hemolytic anemias, is characterized by defective synthesis in the polypeptide chains necessary\\nfor hemoglobin (Hb) production. Consequently, red blood cell (RBC) synthesis is also impaired. \\u03b2-thalassemia is the most common form of this disorder. It results from defective beta polypeptide chain synthesis and occurs in\\nthree clinical forms: major, intermedia, and minor. The resulting anemia's severity depends on whether the patient is homozygous or heterozygous for the thalassemic trait. The prognosis for \\u03b2-thalassemia varies. People with thalassemia major seldom survive to adulthood; children with thalassemia intermedia develop normally into adulthood, although puberty is usually delayed; people with thalassemia minor can expect a normal life span. Causes and incidence Thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia result from homozygous inheritance of the partially dominant autosomal gene responsible for this trait. Thalassemia minor results from heterozygous inheritance of the same gene. In these disorders, total or partial deficiency of beta polypeptide chain production impairs Hb synthesis and results in continual production of fetal Hb, lasting even past the neonatal period. Thalassemia is most common in people of Mediterranean ancestry (especially Italian and Greek) but also occurs in blacks and people from southern China, southeast Asia, and India. Complications Pathological fractures Cardiac arrhythmias Heart failure P Signs and symptoms In thalassemia major (also known as Cooley's anemia, Mediterranean disease, and erythroblastic anemia ),\\nthe neonate is well at birth but develops severe anemia, bone abnormalities, failure to thrive, and life- threatening complications. (See Thalassemia major. )\\nIn many cases, the first signs are pallor and yellow skin and scleras in infants ages 3 to 6 months. Later clinical features, in addition to severe anemia, include splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, with abdominal enlargement, frequent infections, bleeding tendencies (especially toward\\nepistaxis), and anorexia. Children with thalassemia major typically have small bodies and large heads and may also be mentally retarded. Infants may have mongoloid features because bone marrow hyperactivity has thickened the bone at the base of the nose. As these children grow older, they become susceptible to pathologic fractures as a result of expansion of the marrow cavities with thinning of the long bones. They're also subject to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and other complications that result from iron deposits in the heart and in other tissues from repeated blood transfusions. Thalassemia intermedia comprises moderate thalassemic disorders in homozygotes. Patients with this condition show some degree of anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly and, possibly, signs of hemosiderosis due to increased intestinal absorption of iron. Thalassemia minor may cause mild anemia but usually produces no symptoms and is commonly overlooked. It should be differentiated from iron deficiency anemia. Diagnosis In thalassemia major, laboratory results show lowered RBC\\ncount and Hb level, microcytosis, and elevated reticulocyte, bilirubin,\\nand urinary and fecal urobilinogen levels. A low serum folate level indicates increased folate utilization by the hypertrophied bone marrow.\\nA peripheral blood smear reveals target cells, microcytes, pale nucleated RBCs, and marked anisocytosis. X-rays of the skull and long bones show thinning and widening of the marrow space because of overactive bone marrow. The bones of the skull and vertebrae may appear granular; long bones may show areas of osteoporosis. The phalanges may also be deformed (rectangular or biconvex). Quantitative Hb studies show\\na significant rise in HbF and a slight increase in HbA 2 . Diagnosis must rule out iron deficiency anemia, which also produces hypochromia (slightly lowered Hb level) and microcytic (notably small) RBCs. In thalassemia intermedia, laboratory results show hypochromia and microcytic RBCs, but the anemia is less severe than that\\nin thalassemia major. In thalassemia minor, laboratory results show hypochromia and microcytic RBCs. Quantitative Hb studies show a significant increase in HbA 2 levels and a moderate rise in HbF levels. THALASSEMIA MAJOR X-rays show a characteristic skull abnormality in thalassemia major: diploetic fibers extending from the internal lamina. Treatment Treatment of thalassemia major is essentially supportive.\\nFor example, infections require prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Folic acid supplements help maintain folic acid levels in the face of increased requirements. Transfusions of packed RBCs raise Hb\\nlevels but must be P used judiciously to minimize iron overload. In addition, patients who receive blood transfusions should avoid iron supplements and oxidative drugs because iron levels can become toxic. Those who receive significant numbers of blood transfusions may require chelation therapy to remove iron from the body. Bone marrow transplantation is being investigated as a treatment, with success found\\nmostly in children. Thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia minor generally don't require treatment. Iron supplements are contraindicated in all forms of thalassemia. Special considerations During and after RBC transfusions for thalassemia major, watch for adverse reactions \\u2014shaking chills, fever, rash, itching, and hives. Stress the importance of good nutrition, meticulous wound care, periodic dental checkups, and other measures to prevent infection. Discuss with the parents of a young patient various options for healthy physical and creative outlets. Such a\\nchild must avoid strenuous athletic activity because of increased oxygen demand and the tendency toward pathologic fractures, but he may participate in less stressful activities. Teach parents to watch for signs of hepatitis and iron overload, which are always possible with frequent transfusions. Because parents may have questions about the vulnerability of future offspring, refer them for genetic counseling. Also refer adult patients with thalassemia minor and thalassemia intermedia for genetic counseling; they need to recognize the risk of transmitting thalassemia major to their children if they marry another person with thalassemia. If such people choose to marry and have children, their children should be evaluated for thalassemia by\\nage 1. Be sure to tell people with thalassemia minor that their condition is benign. Iron deficiency anemia Iron deficiency anemia is caused by an inadequate supply of iron for optimal formation of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in smaller (microcytic) cells with less color on staining. Body stores of iron, including plasma iron, decrease, as do levels of transferrin, which binds with and transports iron. Insufficient body stores of iron lead to a depleted RBC mass and, in turn, to a decreased hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (hypochromia) and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. (See Absorption and storage of iron. ) Causes and incidence Iron deficiency anemia may result from: inadequate dietary intake of iron (less than 1 to 2 mg/day), such as in prolonged unsupplemented breast-feeding or bottlefeeding of infants or during periods of stress such as rapid growth in children and adolescents iron malabsorption, such as in chronic diarrhea, partial or total gastrectomy, chronic diverticulosis, and malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease and pernicious anemia blood loss secondary to drug-induced GI bleeding (from anticoagulants, aspirin, and steroids) or due to heavy menses, hemorrhage from trauma, GI ulcers, esophageal varices, or cancer pregnancy, which diverts maternal iron to the fetus for erythropoiesis intravascular hemolysis-induced hemoglobinuria or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria mechanical erythrocyte trauma caused by a prosthetic heart valve or vena cava filters. A common disease worldwide, iron deficiency anemia affects 10% to 30% of the adult population of the United States. It occurs most commonly in premenopausal women, infants (particularly premature or low-birth- weight neonates), children, and adolescents (especially girls). Persons who are at increased risk for iron deficiency include those of low socioeconomic status who don't get a well-balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods. P Complications Infection Pneumonia Pica (in children) Bleeding Hemochromotosis (from excess iron treatment in children) Signs and symptoms Because of the gradual progression of iron deficiency anemia, many patients are initially asymptomatic except for symptoms of any underlying condition. They tend not to seek medical treatment until anemia is severe. At advanced stages, decreased Hb levels and the consequent decrease in the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity cause the patient to develop dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, listlessness, pallor, inability to concentrate, irritability, headache, and a susceptibility to infection. Decreased oxygen perfusion causes the heart to compensate with increased cardiac output and tachycardia. In chronic iron deficiency anemia, nails become spoon-shaped and brittle, the mouth's corners crack, the tongue turns smooth, and the patient complains of dysphagia or may develop pica. Associated neuromuscular effects include vasomotor disturbances, numbness and tingling of the extremities, and neuralgic pain. Diagnosis Blood studies (serum iron levels, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin levels) and stores in bone marrow may confirm iron deficiency anemia. However, the results of these tests can be misleading because of complicating factors, such as infection, pneumonia, blood transfusion, or iron supplements. Characteristic blood test results include: low Hb levels (in males, less than 12 g/dl; in females, less than 10 g/dl) low hematocrit (in males, less than 39%; in females, less than 35%) low serum iron levels, with high binding capacity low serum ferritin levels low RBC count, with microcytic and hypochromic cells (in early stages, RBC count may be normal, except in infants and children) decreased mean corpuscular Hb in severe anemia. Bone marrow studies reveal depleted or absent iron stores (done by staining) and normoblastic hyperplasia. Diagnosis must rule out other forms of anemia, such as those that result from thalassemia minor, cancer, and chronic inflammatory, hepatic, and renal disease. Treatment The first priority of treatment is to determine the underlying cause of anemia. Once this is determined, iron replacement therapy can begin. Treatment of choice is an oral preparation of iron or\\na combination of iron and ascorbic acid (which enhances iron absorption). However, in some cases, iron may have to be administered parenterally \\u2014for instance, if the patient is non-compliant to the oral preparation, if he needs more iron than he can take orally, if malabsorption prevents adequate iron absorption, or if a maximum rate of\\nHb regeneration is desired. ABSORPTION AND STORAGE OF IRON Iron, which is essential to erythropoiesis, is abundant throughout the body. Two-thirds of total body iron is found in hemoglobin (Hb); the other third, mostly in the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow), with small amounts in muscle, blood\\nserum, and body cells. Adequate dietary ingestion of iron and recirculation of iron released from disintegrating red cells maintain iron supplies. The duodenum and upper part of the small intestine absorb dietary iron. Such\\nabsorption depends P on gastric acid content, the amount of reducing substances (ascorbic acid, for example) present in the alimentary canal,\\nand dietary iron intake. If iron intake is deficient, the body gradually depletes its iron stores, causing decreased Hb levels and, eventually, symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Because total dose I.V. infusion of supplemental iron is painless and requires fewer injections, it's usually preferred to I.M. administration. Pregnant patients and geriatric patients with severe anemia, for example, should receive a total dose infusion of iron dextran in normal saline solution over 8 hours. To minimize the risk of an allergic reaction to iron, an I.V. test dose of 0.5 ml should be given first. For more patient care information, see Supportive management of patients with anemia, page 516. Special considerations Monitor the patient's compliance with the prescribed iron supplement therapy. Advise the patient not to stop therapy even if he feels better, because replacement of iron stores takes time. Tell the patient he may take iron supplements with a meal to decrease gastric irritation. Advise him to avoid fiber, milk, milk products, and antacids because they interfere with iron absorption; however, vitamin C can increase absorption. Warn the patient that iron supplements may result in dark green or black stools and can cause constipation. Instruct the patient to drink liquid supplemental iron through a straw to prevent staining his teeth. Tell the patient to report reactions, such\\nas nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, or severe stomach pain, which may require a dosage adjustment. SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ANEMIA To meet the anemic patient's nutritional needs: If the patient is fatigued, urge him to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. If the patient has oral lesions, suggest soft, cool, bland foods. If the patient has dyspepsia, eliminate spicy foods, and include milk and dairy products in his diet. If the patient is anorexic and irritable, encourage his family to bring his favorite foods from home (unless his diet is restricted) and to keep him company during meals, if possible. To set limitations on activities: Assess the effect of a specific activity by monitoring pulse rate during the activity. If the patient's pulse accelerates rapidly and he develops hypotension with hyperpnea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, or weakness, the activity is too strenuous. Tell the patient to pace his activities and to allow for frequent rest periods. To decrease susceptibility to infection: Use strict sterile technique. Isolate the patient from infectious persons. Instruct the patient to avoid crowds and other sources of infection. Encourage him to practice good hand- washing technique. Stress the importance of receiving necessary immunizations and prompt medical treatment for any sign of infection. To prepare the patient for diagnostic testing: Explain erythropoiesis, the function of blood, and the purpose of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. P Tell the patient how he can participate in\\ndiagnostic testing. Give him an honest description of the pain or discomfort he will probably experience. If possible, schedule all tests to avoid disrupting the patient's meals, sleep, and visiting hours. To prevent complications: Observe for signs of bleeding that may exacerbate anemia. Check stool for occult bleeding. Assess for ecchymoses, gingival bleeding, and hematuria. Monitor vital signs frequently. If the patient is confined to strict bed rest, assist with range-of-motion exercises and frequent turning, coughing, and deep breathing. If blood transfusions are needed for severe anemia (hemoglobin level less than 5 g/dl), give washed red blood\\ncells, as ordered, in partial exchange if evidence of pump failure is present. Carefully monitor for signs of circulatory overload or transfusion reaction. Watch for a change in pulse rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate, or onset of fever, chills, pruritus, or edema. If any of these signs develop, stop the transfusion and notify the physician. Warn the patient to move about or change positions slowly to minimize dizziness induced by cerebral hypoxia. HOW TO INJECT IRON SOLUTIONS For deep I.M. injections of iron solutions, use the Z-track technique to avoid subcutaneous irritation and discoloration from leaking medication. Choose a 19G to 20G, 2\\u2033 to 3\\u2033 needle. After drawing up the solution, change to a fresh needle to avoid tracking the solution through to subcutaneous tissue. Draw 0.5 cc of air into the syringe as an \\u201cair lock.\\u201d Displace the skin and fat at the injection site (in the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks or the ventro- gluteal site only) firmly to one side. Clean the area and insert the needle. Aspirate to check for entry into a blood vessel. Inject the solution slowly, followed by the 0.5 cc of air in the syringe. Wait 10 seconds, then pull\\nthe needle straight out, and release tissues. Apply direct pressure to the site but don't massage it. Caution the patient against vigorous exercise for 15 to 30 minutes. P ALERT If the patient receives I.V. iron, monitor the infusion rate carefully and observe for an allergic reaction. Stop the infusion and begin supportive treatment immediately if the patient shows signs of an adverse reaction. Also, watch for dizziness and headache and for thrombophlebitis around the I.V. site. Use the Z-track injection method when administering iron I.M. to prevent skin discoloration, scarring, and irritating iron deposits in the skin. (See How to inject iron solutions .) Because an iron deficiency may recur, advise regular checkups and blood studies. (See Preventing iron deficiency anemia, page 518.) PREVENTION PREVENTING IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Play a vital role in preventing iron deficiency anemia in your patients by encouraging the following actions: Include iron-rich foods in diet Teach the basics of a nutritionally balanced diet by having your patients include foods rich in iron, such as those listed below, in their diet. Meat (especially liver) Egg yolks Dried beans or peas Green leafy vegetables Dried fruits Cream of Wheat cereal Molasses Include vitamin C-rich foods in diet Encourage your patients to consume foods high in vitamin C\\n(ascorbic acid) at the same time they're eating iron-rich foods. The vitamin C aids in the absorption of the iron.These foods are rich in vitamin C: Citrus fruit or juice Tomatoes Broccoli Melons Strawberries Red peppers Include prophylactic oral iron Emphasize the need for high-risk individuals, such as premature infants, children younger than age 2, and pregnant women, to receive prophylactic oral iron, as ordered by a physician. (Children younger than age 2 should also receive supplemental cereals and formulas high in iron.) Assess dietary habits Assess a family's dietary habits for iron intake and note the influence of childhood eating patterns, cultural food preferences, and family income on adequate nutrition. Assess medication history Carefully assess your patients' drug histories because certain drugs, such as pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E, may interfere with iron metabolism and absorption and because aspirin, steroids, and other drugs may cause GI bleeding. (Teach patients who must take medications that are gastric irritants to take these medications with meals or milk.) POLYCYTHEMIAS Polycythemia vera Polycythemia vera is a chronic, myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell (RBC) mass, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and increased hemoglobin concentration, with normal or increased plasma volume. This disease is also known as primary polycythemia, erythremia, polycythemia rubra vera, splenomegalic polycythemia, and Vaquez-Osler disease. The prognosis depends on the patient's age at diagnosis, the type of treatment used, and complications. Mortality is high if polycythemia is untreated or is associated with leukemia or myeloid metaplasia. Causes and incidence In polycythemia vera, uncontrolled and rapid cellular reproduction and maturation cause proliferation or hyperplasia of all bone marrow cells (panmyelosis). The cause of such uncontrolled cellular\\nactivity is unknown but it's probably due to a multipotential stem cell\\ndefect. P Polycythemia vera usually occurs between ages 40 and 60, most commonly among males of Jewish ancestry; it seldom affects children or blacks and doesn't appear to be familial. Complications Thrombosis of small vessels Ruddy cyanosis of nose Clubbing Splenomegaly Renal calculus formation Abdominal thrombosis Hemorrhage Signs and symptoms Increased RBC mass results in hyperviscosity and inhibits\\nblood flow to microcirculation. Subsequently, increased viscosity, diminished velocity, and thrombocytosis promote intravascular thrombosis. In early stages, polycythemia vera usually produces no symptoms. (Increased hematocrit [HCT] may be an incidental finding.) However, as altered circulation secondary to increased RBC mass produces\\nhypervolemia and hyperviscosity, the patient may complain of a feeling of fullness in the head, headache, dizziness, and other symptoms, depending on the body system affected. The patient may also complain of severe itching after a warm or hot shower. Hyperviscosity may lead to thrombosis of smaller vessels with ruddy cyanosis of the nose and clubbing of the digits. Paradoxically, hemorrhage is a complication of polycythemia vera. It may be due to defective platelet function or to hyperviscosity and the local effects from excess RBCs exerting pressure on distended venous and capillary walls. (See Clinical features of polycythemia vera, page 520.) Diagnosis Laboratory studies confirm polycythemia vera by showing increased RBC mass and normal arterial oxygen saturation in association with splenomegaly or two of the following: thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, or elevated serum vitamin B 12 level or unbound B 12 -binding capacity. Another common finding is increased uric acid production,\\nleading to hyperuricemia and hyperuricuria. Other laboratory results include increased blood histamine levels, decreased serum iron concentration, and decreased or absent urinary erythropoietin. Bone marrow biopsy reveals panmyelosis. Treatment Phlebotomy can reduce RBC mass promptly. The frequency of phlebotomy and the amount of blood removed each time depend on the patient's condition. Typically, 350 to 500 ml of blood can be removed every other day until the HCT is reduced to the low-normal range. After repeated phlebotomies, the patient develops iron deficiency, which stabilizes RBC production and reduces the need for phlebotomy. Pheresis permits the return of plasma to the patient, diluting the blood and reducing hypovolemic symptoms. Phlebotomy doesn't reduce the white blood cell or platelet count and won't control the hyperuricemia associated with marrow cell proliferation. For severe symptoms, myelosuppressive therapy\\nmay be used. Chemotherapeutic agents may be used to suppress the bone marrow, but these agents may cause leukemia and should be reserved for older patients and those with problems uncontrolled by phlebotomy. The current preferred myelosuppressive agent is hydroxyurea, which isn't associated with leukemia. Patients who have had previous thrombotic problems should be considered for myelosuppressive therapy. The use of antiplatelet therapy is controversial because it may cause gastric bleeding. Allopurinol may be given for hyperuricemia. Special considerations P P If the patient requires phlebotomy, explain the procedure, and reassure him that it will relieve distressing symptoms. Check blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. During phlebotomy, make sure the patient is lying down comfortably to prevent vertigo and syncope. Stay alert for tachycardia, clamminess, or complaints of vertigo. If these effects occur, the procedure should be stopped. Immediately after phlebotomy, check blood pressure and pulse rate. Have the patient sit up for about 5 minutes before allowing him to walk; this prevents vasovagal attack or orthostatic hypotension. Also, have him drink 24 oz (710 ml) of juice or water. Tell the patient to watch for and report signs or symptoms of iron deficiency (pallor, weight loss, asthenia [weakness], and glossitis). Keep the patient active and ambulatory to prevent thrombosis. If bed rest is absolutely necessary, prescribe a daily program of both active and passive range-of-motion exercises. Watch for complications: hypervolemia, thrombocytosis, and signs or symptoms of an impending stroke (decreased sensation, numbness, transitory paralysis, fleeting blindness, headache, and epistaxis). Regularly examine the patient closely for bleeding. Tell him which are the most common bleeding sites (such as the\\nnose, gingiva, and skin) so he can check for bleeding. Advise him to report any abnormal bleeding promptly. To compensate for increased uric acid production, give additional fluids, administer allopurinol, and alkalinize the urine to prevent uric acid calculi. If the patient has symptom-producing splenomegaly, suggest or provide small, frequent meals, followed by a rest period, to prevent nausea and vomiting. Report acute abdominal pain immediately; it may signal splenic infarction, renal calculi, or abdominal organ thrombosis. During myelosuppressive treatment: Monitor complete blood count and platelet count before and during therapy. Warn the outpatient who develops leukopenia that his resistance to infection is low; advise him to avoid crowds and watch for the symptoms of infection. If leukopenia develops in a hospitalized patient who needs reverse isolation, follow hospital guidelines. If thrombocytopenia develops, tell the patient to watch for signs of bleeding (blood in urine, nosebleeds, and black stool). Tell the patient about possible reactions (nausea, vomiting, and risk of infection) to alkylating agents. Alopecia\\nmay follow the use of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and uracil mustard; sterile hemorrhagic cystitis may follow the use of cyclophosphamide (forcing fluids can prevent it). Watch for and report all reactions. If nausea and vomiting occur, begin antiemetic therapy and adjust the patient's diet.

Causes and incidence There are three possible causes of spurious polycythemia: Dehydration\\u2014Conditions that promote severe\\nfluid loss decrease plasma levels and lead to hemoconcentration. Such conditions include persistent vomiting or diarrhea, burns, adrenocortical insufficiency, aggressive diuretic therapy, decreased fluid intake, diabetic acidosis, and renal disease. Hemoconcentration due to stress\\u2014 Nervous stress leads to hemoconcentration by some unknown mechanism (possibly by temporarily decreasing circulating plasma volume or vascular redistribution of erythrocytes). This form of erythrocytosis (chronically elevated HCT) is particularly common in the middle-aged man\\nwho's a chronic smoker and a type A personality (tense, hard driving, and anxious). High normal RBC mass and low normal plasma\\nvolume\\u2014In many patients, an increased HCT merely reflects a normally high RBC mass and low plasma volume. This is particularly common in patients who don't smoke, aren't obese, and have no history of hypertension. Other factors that may be associated with spurious polycythemia include hypertension, thromboembolitic disease, elevated serum cholesterol and uric acid levels, and familial tendency. It usually affects middle-aged people and occurs more commonly in men than in women. P Complications Hypercholesterolemia Hyperlipidemia Hyperuricemia Signs and symptoms The patient with spurious polycythemia usually has no specific symptoms but may have vague complaints, such as headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Less commonly, he may develop diaphoresis, dyspnea, and claudication. Typically, the patient has a ruddy appearance, a short neck, slight hypertension, and a tendency to hypoventilate when recumbent. He shows no associated hepatosplenomegaly but may have cardiac or pulmonary disease. Diagnosis Hemoglobin levels, HCT, and RBC count are elevated; RBC mass, arterial oxygen saturation, and bone marrow are normal. Plasma volume may be decreased or normal. Hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia,\\nor hyperuricemia may be present. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Spurious polycythemia is distinguishable from true polycythemia vera by its characteristic normal\\nRBC mass, elevated HCT, and the absence of leukocytosis. Treatment The principal goals of treatment are to prevent life-threatening thromboembolism and to correct dehydration. Rehydration\\nwith appropriate fluids and electrolytes is the primary therapy for spurious polycythemia secondary to dehydration. Therapy must also include appropriate measures to prevent continuing fluid loss. Special considerations During rehydration, carefully monitor intake and output to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Whenever appropriate, suggest counseling about the patient's work habits and lack of relaxation. If the patient smokes, make sure he understands how important it is that he stop. Refer\\nhim to a smoking- cessation program if necessary. Emphasize the need for follow-up examinations every 3 to 4 months after leaving the hospital. Thoroughly explain spurious polycythemia, diagnostic measures, and therapy. The hard-driving person predisposed to\\nspurious polycythemia is likely to be more inquisitive and anxious than\\nthe average patient. Answer questions honestly, but take care to reassure him that he can effectively control symptoms by complying with the prescribed treatment. PREVENTION To prevent thromboemboli in predisposed patients, suggest regular exercise and a lowcholesterol diet. Antilipemics may also be necessary. Reduced calorie intake may be required for the obese patient. Secondary polycythemia Secondary polycythemia (also called reactive polycythemia ) is a disorder characterized by excessive production of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) due to hypoxia, tumor, or disease. Causes and incidence Secondary polycythemia may result from increased production of erythropoietin. This hormone, which is possibly produced and secreted in the kidneys, stimulates bone marrow production of RBCs. Increased production may be a compensatory physiologic response to hypoxemia, which may result from: P chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hemoglobin (Hb) abnormalities (such as carboxyhemoglobinemia, which is seen in heavy smokers) heart failure (causing a decreased ventilation-perfusion ratio) right-to-left shunting of blood in the heart (as in transposition of the great vessels) central or peripheral alveolar hypoventilation (as in barbiturate intoxication or pickwickian syndrome) low oxygen content at high altitudes. Increased production of erythropoietin may also be an inappropriate (pathologic) response to renal disease (such as renal vascular impairment, renal cysts, or hydronephrosis), to central nervous\\nsystem disease (such as encephalitis and parkinsonism), to neoplasms (such as renal tumors, uterine myomas, or cerebellar hemangiomas), or to endocrine disorders (such as Cushing's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, or pheochromocytomas). Rarely, secondary polycythemia results from a recessive genetic trait. Secondary polycythemia occurs in about 2 out of every 100,000 people living at or near sea level; incidence rises among those living at high altitudes. Complications Hemorrhage Thromboemboli Signs and symptoms In the hypoxic patient, suggestive physical findings include ruddy cyanotic skin, emphysema, and hypoxemia without hepatosplenomegaly or hypertension. Clubbing of the fingers may occur if\\nthe underlying disease is cardiovascular. When secondary polycythemia isn't caused by hypoxemia, it's usually an incidental finding during treatment of an underlying disease. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Laboratory values for secondary polycythemia include increased RBC mass (increased hematocrit, Hb levels, and mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular Hb values) and urinary erythropoietin and blood histamine levels, with decreased or normal arterial oxygen saturation. Bone marrow biopsies reveal hyperplasia confined to the erythroid series. Unlike polycythemia vera, secondary polycythemia isn't associated with leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. Treatment The goal of treatment is correction of the underlying disease or environmental condition. In severe secondary polycythemia in which altitude is a contributing factor, relocation may be advisable. If secondary polycythemia has produced hazardous hyperviscosity or if the patient doesn't respond to treatment of the primary disease, reduction of blood volume by phlebotomy or pheresis may be effective. Emergency phlebotomy is indicated for prevention of impending vascular occlusion or before emergency surgery. In the latter case, it's usually advisable to remove excess RBCs and reinfuse the patient's plasma. ALERT Because a patient with polycythemia has an increased risk of hemorrhage during and after surgery, elective surgery should be avoided until polycythemia is controlled. Typically, secondary polycythemia disappears when the primary disease is corrected. Special considerations P Keep the patient as active as possible to decrease the risk of thrombosis due to increased blood viscosity. Reduce calorie and sodium intake to counteract the tendency toward hypertension. Before and after phlebotomy, check blood pressure with the patient lying down. After the procedure, have the patient drink 24 oz (710 ml) of water or juice. To prevent syncope, have\\nhim sit upright for about 5 minutes before walking. Emphasize the importance of regular blood studies (every 2 to 3 months), even after the disease is controlled. Teach the patient and his family about the\\nunderlying disorder. Help them understand its relationship to polycythemia and the measures needed to control both. Teach the patient to recognize symptoms of recurring polycythemia and the importance of reporting them promptly. HEMORRHAGIC DISORDERS Allergic purpuras Allergic purpura, a nonthrombocytopenic purpura, is an acute or chronic vascular inflammation affecting the skin, joints, and GI and genitourinary (GU) tracts, in association with allergy symptoms. When allergic purpura primarily affects the GI tract, with accompanying joint pain, it's called Henoch-Sch\\u00f6nlein syndrome, or anaphylactoid purpura. However, the term allergic purpura applies to purpura associated with many other conditions such as erythema nodosum. An acute attack of allergic purpura can last for several weeks and is potentially fatal (usually from renal failure); however, most patients do recover. Fully developed allergic purpura is persistent and debilitating, possibly leading to chronic glomerulonephritis (especially\\nfollowing a streptococcal infection). PURPURIC LESIONS Lesions of allergic purpura, such as those pictured on the foot and leg below, characteristically vary in size. Causes and incidence The most common identifiable cause of allergic purpura is\\nprobably an autoimmune reaction directed against vascular walls, triggered by a bacterial infection (particularly streptococcal infection). Typically, upper respiratory tract infection occurs 1 to 3 weeks before the onset of symptoms. Other possible causes include allergic reactions to some drugs and vaccines, to insect bites, and to some foods (such as wheat, eggs, milk, and chocolate). Allergic purpura affects more males than females and is most prevalent in children ages 3 to 7. The prognosis is more favorable for children than adults. Complications Renal failure Acute glomerulonephritis Signs and symptoms Characteristic skin lesions of allergic purpura are purple, macular, ecchymotic, and of varying size. They're caused by vascular leakage into the skin and mucous membranes. (See Purpuric lesions .)\\nThe lesions usually appear in symmetric patterns on the arms, legs, and\\nbuttocks and are accompanied by pruritus, paresthesia and, occasionally, angioneurotic edema. In children, skin lesions are generally urticarial and expand and become hemorrhagic. Scattered petechiae may appear on the legs, buttocks, and perineum. Henoch-Sch\\u00f6nlein syndrome commonly produces transient or severe colic, tenesmus (spasmodic contraction of the anal sphincter) and constipation, vomiting, and edema or hemorrhage of the mucous membranes\\nof the bowel, resulting in GI bleeding, occult blood in the stool and, possibly, intussusception. Such GI abnormalities may precede overt, cutaneous signs of purpura. Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as rheumatoid pains and periarticular effusions, mostly affect the legs and feet. In 25% to 50% of patients, allergic purpura is associated\\nwith GU signs and symptoms: nephritis; renal hemorrhages that may cause\\nmicroscopic hematuria and disturb renal function; bleeding from the mucosal surfaces of the ureters, bladder, or urethra; and, occasionally, glomerulonephritis. Also possible are moderate and irregular fever, headache, anorexia, and localized edema of the hands, feet, or scalp. Diagnosis No laboratory test clearly identifies allergic purpura (although white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are elevated). Diagnosis therefore necessitates careful clinical observation, in many cases during the second or third attack. Except for\\na positive tourniquet test (a test to assess the capillaries' ability to withstand increased pressure), coagulation and platelet function tests are usually normal. Small-bowel X-rays may reveal areas of transient edema; in many cases, tests for blood in the urine and stool are positive. Increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate renal involvement. Diagnosis must rule out other forms of nonthrombocytopenic purpura. Treatment Treatment is generally symptomatic; for example, severe allergic purpura may require steroids to relieve edema and analgesics to\\nrelieve joint and abdominal pain. Some patients with chronic renal disease may P benefit from immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine along with identification of the provocative allergen. An accurate allergy history is essential. Special considerations Encourage maintenance of an elimination diet to help identify specific allergenic foods so these foods can be eliminated from the patient's diet. Monitor skin lesions and level of pain. Provide analgesics as needed. Watch carefully for complications: GI and GU tract bleeding, edema, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypertension (with\\nnephritis), abdominal rigidity and tenderness, and absence of stool (with intussusception). To prevent muscle atrophy in the bedridden patient, provide passive or active range-of-motion exercises. Provide emotional support and reassurance, especially if the patient is temporarily disfigured by florid skin lesions. After the acute stage, stress the need for the patient to immediately report any recurrence of symptoms (recurrence is most common about 6 weeks after initial onset) and to return for follow-up urinalysis as scheduled. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (also called Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome )\\nis an inherited vascular disorder in which venules and capillaries dilate and form fragile masses of thin convoluted vessels (telangiectases), resulting in an abnormal tendency to hemorrhage. This disorder affects both sexes but may cause less severe bleeding in girls and women. Complication Secondary iron deficiency anemia Causes and incidence Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. It seldom skips generations. In its homozygous state, it may be lethal. It affects 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000\\npeople worldwide. Signs and symptoms Signs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are present in childhood but increase in severity with age. Localized aggregations of dilated capillaries appear on the skin of the face, ears, scalp, hands, arms, and feet; under the nails; and on the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and stomach. These dilated capillaries cause frequent epistaxis, hemoptysis, and GI bleeding, possibly leading to iron deficiency anemia. (In children, epistaxis is usually the first symptom.) Characteristic telangiectases are violet, bleed spontaneously, may be flat or raised, blanch on pressure, and are nonpulsatile. They may be associated with vascular malformations such as\\narteriovenous fistulas. Visceral telangiectases are common in the liver, bladder, respiratory tract, and stomach. The type and distribution of these lesions are generally similar among family members. Generalized capillary fragility, as evidenced by spontaneous bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses, and spider hemangiomas of varying sizes, may exist without overt telangiectasia. (See Typical lesions of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, page 526.)\\nRarely, vascular malformation may cause pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas; then, shunting of blood through the fistulas may lead to hypoxemia, recurring cerebral embolism, brain abscess, and clubbing of digits. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based principally on an established familial\\npattern of bleeding disorders and on clinical evidence of telangiectasia and hemorrhage. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrating depleted iron stores confirms secondary iron deficiency anemia. Hypochromic, microcytic anemia is common; abnormal platelet function may\\nalso be found. P Coagulation tests are essentially irrelevant, however, because hemorrhage in telangiectasia results from weakness in the vascular wall. Treatment Supportive therapy includes blood transfusions for acute hemorrhage and supplemental iron administration to replace iron lost in repeated mucosal bleeding. Ancillary treatments consist of applying pressure and topical hemostatic agents to bleeding sites, cauterizing bleeding sites not readily accessible, and protecting the patient from trauma and unnecessary bleeding. An interventional radiologist may clot off large collections of abnormal blood vessels in the lungs, called arteriovenous malformations, by using a coiling procedure. TYPICAL LESIONS OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA Dilated capillaries, either flat or raised, appear in localized aggregations, as on the fingers. On the face, spider hemangiomas reflect capillary fragility. Parenteral administration of supplemental iron enhances absorption to maintain adequate iron stores and prevents gastric irritation. Administering antipyretics or antihistamines before blood transfusions, and using saline-washed cells, frozen blood, or other types of leukocyte- poor blood instead of whole blood may prevent febrile\\ntransfusion reactions. The administration of estrogen has proved effective in some patients, especially when used to control epistaxis. Special considerations ALERT During the first 15 minutes of a blood transfusion, stay with the patient to watch for adverse reactions. Afterward, check again every 15 minutes for signs and symptoms of a febrile or an allergic transfusion reaction (flushing, shaking chills, fever, headache, rash, tachycardia, and hypertension) because patients with this disorder are quite susceptible to this type of reaction. Observe the patient for indications of GI bleeding, such as hematemesis and melena. Instruct him to watch for and report such signs as well. P If the patient requires an iron supplement, stress the importance of following dosage instructions and of taking oral iron with meals to minimize gastric irritation. Warn him that iron turns stools dark green or black and may cause constipation. Provide emotional and psychological support. Encourage the patient to express concerns he may have about his\\ndisease and its treatment. As much as possible, include him in care decisions. Encourage fluid intake, when possible, if the patient is experiencing a bleeding episode or is hypovolemic. Monitor intake and output. Provide good skin care and hygiene, and use sterile technique when caring for the patient. Lesions bleed easily,\\nwhich may result in infection and skin breakdown. Monitor the patient's organ function through physical examination and the comparison of laboratory tests to detect renal, hepatic, or respiratory failure. Teach the patient and his family how to manage minor bleeding episodes, especially recurrent epistaxis, and how to recognize major episodes that necessitate emergency intervention. Teach the patient and his family about the\\ndisease's hereditary nature. Refer him for genetic counseling, as appropriate, and to the Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Foundation\\nInternational for support and information. Thrombocytopenia The most common cause of hemorrhagic disorders, thrombocytopenia is characterized by deficiency of circulating platelets. Because platelets play a vital role in coagulation, this disease poses a serious threat to hemostasis. (See What happens in thrombocytopenia, pages 528 and 529.)\\nThe prognosis is excellent in drug-induced thrombocytopenia if the offending drug is withdrawn; in such cases, recovery may be immediate. In other types, the prognosis depends on the patient's response to treatment of the underlying cause. Causes Thrombocytopenia may be congenital or acquired; the acquired form is more common. In either case, it usually results from decreased or defective production of platelets in the marrow (such as occurs in leukemia, aplastic anemia, or toxicity with certain drugs) or from increased destruction outside the marrow caused by an underlying disorder (such as cirrhosis of the liver, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or severe infection). Less commonly, it results from sequestration (hypersplenism and hypothermia) or platelet loss. Acquired\\nthrombocytopenia may result from certain drugs, such as sulfonamides, antibiotics, gold salts, estrogens, or chemotherapeutic agents. (See Causes of decreased circulating platelets, page 530.) ELDER TIP In older adults, platelet characteristics change. Granular constituents decrease and plateletrelease factors increase. These changes may reflect diminished bone marrow and increased fibrinogen levels. An idiopathic form of thrombocytopenia commonly occurs in\\nchildren. A transient form may follow viral infection (such as Epstein-Barr virus or infectious mononucleosis). Complication Acute hemorrhage Signs and symptoms Thrombocytopenia typically produces a sudden onset of petechiae or ecchymoses in the skin or bleeding into any mucous membrane. Nearly all patients are otherwise asymptomatic, although some may complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness. In adults, large, blood-filled bullae characteristically appear in the mouth. In severe thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage may lead to tachycardia, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, and death. P Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the results of the patient history (especially a drug history), physical examination, and laboratory tests.\\nCoagulation tests reveal a decreased platelet count (in adults, less than 100,000/\\u00b5l), prolonged bleeding time (although this doesn't always indicate platelet quality) and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. If increased destruction of platelets is causing thrombocytopenia, bone marrow studies will reveal a greater number of megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) and shortened platelet survival (several hours or days rather than the usual 7 to 10 days). Treatment Treatment varies with the underlying cause and may include corticosteroids or immune globulin to increase platelet production. The treatment of choice is removal of the offending agents in drug-induced thrombocytopenia or treatment of the underlying cause. Platelet transfusions are helpful only in treating complications of severe hemorrhage. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN THROMBOCYTOPENIA Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of bleeding disorders and is characterized by a severe decrease in platelets. This platelet decrease can result from hematologic malignancy, radiation or drug therapy, idiopathic causes, blood transfusions, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or splenomegaly. Excessive hemorrhaging\\ncan lead to shock if interventions are delayed. This chart shows how these conditions and treatments develop into thrombocytopenic hemorrhage. P Special considerations When caring for the patient with thrombocytopenia, take every possible precaution against bleeding. Protect the patient from trauma. Keep the side rails up and pad them, if possible. Promote the use of an electric razor and a soft toothbrush. Avoid invasive procedures, such as venipuncture or urinary catheterization, if possible. When venipuncture is unavoidable, be sure to exert pressure on the puncture site for at least 20 minutes or until the bleeding stops. Monitor platelet count daily. A 1- to 2-hour postplatelet count will aid assessment of response. Test stool for guaiac; dipstick urine and vomitus for blood. Watch for bleeding (petechiae, ecchymoses, surgical or GI bleeding, and menorrhagia). Warn the patient to avoid aspirin in any form and other drugs that impair coagulation. Teach him how to recognize\\naspirin or ibuprofen compounds on labels of over-the-counter remedies. Advise the patient to avoid straining at stool or coughing, as both can lead to increased intracranial pressure, possibly causing cerebral hemorrhage in the patient with thrombocytopenia. Provide a stool softener to avoid constipation. During periods of active bleeding, maintain the patient on strict bed rest if necessary. When administering platelet concentrate, remember that platelets are extremely fragile, so infuse them quickly. Don't give platelets to a patient with a fever. ALERT During platelet transfusion, monitor\\nthe patient for febrile reaction (flushing, chills, fever, headache, tachycardia, and hypertension). P Histocompatibility locus antigen-typed platelets may be ordered to prevent febrile reaction. A patient with a history of minor reactions may benefit from acetaminophen and diphenhydramine before transfusion. If thrombocytopenia is drug-induced, stress the importance of avoiding the offending drug. If the patient must receive long-term steroid therapy, teach him to watch for and report cushingoid signs (acne, moon face, hirsutism, buffalo hump, hypertension, girdle obesity,\\nthinning arms and legs, glycosuria, and edema). Emphasize that steroid doses must be discontinued gradually. During steroid therapy, monitor fluid and electrolyte balance, and watch for infection, pathologic fractures, and mood changes. CAUSES OF DECREASED CIRCULATING PLATELETS Diminished or defective platelet production Congenital Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Maternal ingestion of thiazides Neonatal rubella Polycythemia Acquired Aplastic anemia Marrow infiltration (acute and chronic leukemias, tumor) Nutritional deficiency (B12, folic acid) Myelosuppressive agents Drugs that directly influence platelet production (thiazides, alcohol, hormones) Radiation Viral infections (measles, dengue) Increased peripheral platelet destruction Congenital Nonimmune (prematurity, erythroblastosis fetalis, infection) Immune (drug sensitivity, maternal ITP). Acquired Nonimmune (infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) Immune (drug-induced, especially with quinine and quinidine; post-transfusion purpura; acute and chronic ITP; sepsis; alcohol) Invasive lines and devices Intra-aortic balloon pump Prosthetic heart valves Heparin Platelet sequestration Hypersplenism Hypothermia Platelet loss Hemorrhage Extracorporeal perfusion Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombocytopenia that results from immunologic platelet destruction, may\\nbe acute (postviral thrombocytopenia) or chronic (Werlhof's disease, purpura hemorrhagica, essential thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia). The prognosis for acute ITP is excellent; nearly four\\nout of five patients recover without treatment. The prognosis for chronic ITP is good; remissions lasting weeks or years are common, especially among women. P Causes and incidence ITP may be an autoimmune disorder, because antibodies that reduce the life span of platelets have been found in nearly all patients. The spleen probably helps to remove platelets modified by the antibody. Acute ITP usually follows a viral infection, such as rubella or chickenpox, and can follow immunization with a live virus vaccine. Chronic ITP seldom follows infection and is commonly linked to immunologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It's also linked to drug reactions. ITP frequently occurs in patients who have abused alcohol, heroin, or morphine, and in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who are exposed to the rubella virus. Acute ITP usually affects children between ages 2 and 6; chronic ITP mainly affects adults younger than age 50, especially women between ages 20 and 40. Complications Cerebral hemorrhage Fatal purpuric lesions in vital organs Signs and symptoms Clinical features of ITP common to all forms of thrombocytopenia include petechiae, ecchymoses, and mucosal bleeding from the mouth, nose, or GI tract. Generally, hemorrhage is a rare physical finding. Purpuric lesions may occur in vital organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, or brain, and may prove fatal. In acute ITP, which commonly occurs in children, onset is usually sudden, causing easy bruising, epistaxis, and bleeding gums. Onset of chronic ITP is insidious. Diagnosis Platelet count less than 20,000/\\u00b5l and prolonged bleeding\\ntime suggest ITP. Platelet size and morphologic appearance may be abnormal; anemia may be present if bleeding has occurred. As in thrombocytopenia, bone marrow studies show an abundance of megakaryocytes and a shortened circulating platelet survival time (hours\\nor days). Occasionally, platelet antibodies may be found in vitro, but this diagnosis is usually inferred from platelet survival data and the absence of an underlying disease. Treatment Acute ITP may be allowed to run its course without intervention or may be treated with glucocorticoids or immune globulin. For chronic ITP, corticosteroids may be the initial treatment of choice.\\nPatients who fail to respond within 1 to 4 months or who need high steroid dosage are candidates for splenectomy, which may be successful in 50% of cases. Alternative treatments include immunosuppression, high-dose gamma globulin injections, and immunoabsorption apheresis using staphylococcal protein-A columns, which filter antibodies out of the bloodstream. Anti-RhD therapy can also be useful in people with specific blood types. Before splenectomy, the patient may require blood, blood components, and vitamin K to correct anemia and coagulation defects. After splenectomy, he may need blood and component replacement and platelet concentrate. Normally, platelets increase spontaneously after splenectomy. Special considerations Patient care for ITP is essentially the same as for other\\ntypes of thrombocytopenia, with emphasis on teaching the patient to observe for petechiae, ecchymoses, and other signs of recurrence. Monitor patients receiving immunosuppressants for signs of bone marrow depression, infection, mucositis, GI ulcers, and severe diarrhea or vomiting. Tell the patient to avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, and warfarin, as\\nthese drugs interfere with platelet function and blood clotting. Platelet function disorders Platelet function disorders are similar to thrombocytopenia but result from platelet dysfunction rather than platelet deficiency. They characteristically cause defects in platelet adhesion or procoagulation activity (ability to bind coagulation factors\\nto their surface to form a stable fibrin clot). Such disorders may also\\ncreate defects in platelet P aggregation and thromboxane A 2 and may produce abnormalities by preventing the release of adenosine diphosphate (defective platelet release reaction). The prognosis varies widely. Causes and incidence Abnormal platelet function disorders may be inherited (autosomal recessive) or acquired. Inherited disorders cause bone marrow production of platelets that are ineffective in the clotting mechanism. Acquired disorders result from the effects of such drugs as aspirin or carbenicillin; from such systemic diseases as uremia; or from other hematologic disorders. Complication Hemorrhage FACTS ABOUT PLATELET CONCENTRATE Contents Platelets, white blood cells, some plasma Random platelets (ABO matched) Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) platelets (HLA-typed for multiple transfusions) Amount 30 to 50 ml per donor 4 to 8 donor units given each time (each unit should raise the platelet count by 5,000/\\u00b5l) Shelf life 6 to 72 hours (best used within 24 hours) Signs and symptoms Generally, the sudden appearance of petechiae or purpura or excessive bruising and bleeding of the nose and gums are the first overt signs of platelet function disorders. More serious signs are external hemorrhage, internal hemorrhage into the muscles and visceral organs, or excessive bleeding during surgery. Diagnosis Prolonged bleeding time in a patient with both a normal platelet count and normal clotting factors suggests this diagnosis. Determination of the defective mechanism requires a blood film and a platelet function test to measure platelet release reaction and aggregation. Depending on the type of platelet dysfunction, some or all of the test results may be abnormal. Other typical laboratory findings are poor clot retraction and decreased prothrombin conversion. Baseline testing includes complete blood count and differential and appropriate tests to determine hemorrhage sites. In platelet function disorders, plasma clotting factors, platelet counts, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin levels, and thrombin times are usually normal. Treatment Platelet replacement is the only satisfactory treatment for inherited platelet dysfunction. However, acquired platelet function disorders respond to adequate treatment of the underlying disease or discontinuation of damaging drug therapy. Plasmapheresis effectively controls bleeding caused by a plasma element that's inhibiting platelet function. During this procedure, one or more units of whole blood are removed from the patient; the plasma is removed from the whole blood, and the remaining packed red blood cells are reinfused. (See Facts about platelet concentrate. ) Special considerations Obtain an accurate patient history, including onset of bleeding, use of drugs (especially aspirin), and family history of bleeding disorders. Watch closely for bleeding from skin, nose, gums, GI tract, or an injury site. P Help the patient avoid unnecessary trauma.\\nAdvise him to tell his dentist about this condition before undergoing oral surgery. (Also stress the need for good oral hygiene to help prevent the need for such surgery.) Alert other care team members to the patient's hemorrhagic potential, especially before he undergoes diagnostic tests or surgery that may cause trauma and bleeding. Observe the patient undergoing plasmapheresis for hypovolemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and other signs of volume depletion. If platelet dysfunction is inherited, help\\nthe patient and his family understand and accept the disorder's nature.\\nTeach them how to manage potential bleeding episodes. Warn them that petechiae, ecchymoses, and bleeding from the nose, gums, and GI tract signal abnormal bleeding and should be reported immediately. Tell the patient with a known coagulopathy\\nor hepatic disease to avoid aspirin, aspirin compounds, and other agents that impair coagulation. Advise the patient to wear a medical identification bracelet or to carry a card identifying him as a potential bleeder. Von Willebrand's disease Von Willebrand's disease is a hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by prolonged bleeding time; moderate deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), clotting factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) and, possibly, factor VIII coagulant protein (VIII:C); and impaired platelet function. This disease commonly causes bleeding from the skin or mucosal surfaces and, in females, excessive uterine bleeding. Bleeding may range from mild and asymptomatic to severe, potentially fatal hemorrhage. The prognosis, however, is usually good. The three types of von Willebrand's disease are: Type 1: the most common form; there's decreased VWF and factor VIII may be below normal; this is the mildest form Type 2: the VWF contains a defect causing it to not function properly; there are four subtypes: 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N; it's important to know which subtype as each is treated differently Type 3: this is the rarest and most severe form; there's no VWF and factor VIII is at low levels. Causes and incidence Unlike hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait that affects males and females equally. One theory of pathophysiology holds that mild to moderate deficiency of factor VIII and defective platelet adhesion prolong coagulation time. Specifically, this results from a deficiency of the VWF, which stabilizes the factor VIII molecule and is needed for proper platelet function. Defective platelet function is characterized by: decreased agglutination and adhesion at the bleeding site reduced platelet retention when filtered through a column of packed glass beads diminished ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. Recently, an acquired form has been identified in patients with cancer and immune disorders. Von Willebrand's disease, which doesn't have any racial or ethnic associations, affects about 1% of the population. Complication Severe, potentially life-threatening hemorrhage Signs and symptoms Von Willebrand's disease produces easy bruising, epistaxis, and bleeding from the gums. Petechiae are rarely seen. Severe\\nforms of this disease may cause hemorrhage after laceration or surgery,\\nmenorrhagia, and GI bleeding. Excessive postpartum bleeding is uncommon\\nbecause factor VIII levels and bleeding time abnormalities become less pronounced during pregnancy. Massive soft-tissue hemorrhage and bleeding\\ninto joints seldom occur. Severity of bleeding may lessen with age, and P bleeding episodes occur sporadically\\u2014a patient may bleed excessively after one dental extraction but not after another. Diagnosis Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are mild, laboratory values are borderline, and factor VIII levels fluctuate. However, a positive family history and characteristic bleeding patterns and laboratory values help establish the diagnosis. Typical laboratory data include: prolonged bleeding time (more than 6 minutes) slightly prolonged partial thromboplastin time (more than 45 seconds) absent or reduced levels of factor VIII-related antigens and low factor VIII activity level defective in vitro platelet aggregation (using the ristocetin coagulation factor assay test) normal platelet count and normal clot retraction. Treatment The goals of treatment are to shorten bleeding time by local measures and to replace factor VIII (and, consequently, VWF) by infusion of cryoprecipitate or blood fractions that are rich in factor VIII. During bleeding and before surgery, I.V. infusion of cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma (in quantities sufficient to raise factor VIII levels to 50% of normal) shortens bleeding time. Desmopressin given parenterally or intranasally is effective in raising serum levels of VWF. Special considerations The care plan should include local measures to control bleeding and patient teaching to prevent bleeding, unnecessary trauma, and complications. After surgery, monitor bleeding time for 24 to 48 hours, and watch for signs of new bleeding. During a bleeding episode, elevate and apply cold compresses and gentle pressure to the bleeding site. Refer parents of affected children for genetic counseling. Advise the patient to consult the physician after even minor trauma and before all surgery to determine if\\nreplacement of blood components is necessary. Instruct the patient to watch for signs of hepatitis within 6 weeks to 6 months after transfusion. Warn the patient against using aspirin and other drugs that impair platelet function. Advise the patient who has a severe form to avoid contact sports. Disseminated intravascular coagulation Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs as a life-threatening complication of diseases and conditions that accelerate\\nclotting, causing small blood vessel occlusion, organ necrosis, depletion of circulating clotting factors and platelets, and activation of the fibrinolytic system. This, in turn, can provoke severe hemorrhage. (See Three mechanisms of DIC .)\\nClotting in the microcirculation usually affects the kidneys and extremities but may occur in the brain, lungs, pituitary and adrenal glands, and GI mucosa. Other conditions, such as vitamin K deficiency, hepatic disease, and anticoagulant therapy, may cause a similar hemorrhage. DIC, also called consumption coagulopathy or defibrination syndrome, is generally an acute condition but may be chronic in cancer patients. The prognosis depends on early detection and treatment, the hemorrhage's severity, and treatment of the underlying disease or condition. Causes DIC may result from: infection\\u2014gram-negative or grampositive septicemia; viral, fungal, or rickettsial infection; protozoal infection obstetric complications\\u2014abruptio placentae, amniotic fluid embolism, retained dead fetus, septic abortion, and eclampsia P neoplastic disease\\u2014acute leukemia, metastatic carcinoma, and aplastic anemia disorders that produce necrosis\\u2014 extensive\\nburns and trauma, brain tissue destruction, transplant rejection, and hepatic necrosis other factors\\u2014heatstroke, shock, poisonous\\nsnakebite, cirrhosis, fat embolism, incompatible blood transfusion, cardiac arrest, surgery necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass, giant hemangioma, severe venous thrombosis, and purpura fulminans. It isn't clear why such disorders lead to DIC, nor is it certain that they lead to it through a common mechanism. In many patients, the triggering mechanisms may be the entrance of foreign protein into the circulation and vascular endothelial injury. Regardless\\nof how DIC begins, the typical accelerated clotting results in generalized activation of prothrombin and a consequent excess of thrombin. Excess thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, producing fibrin clots in the microcirculation. This process consumes exorbitant amounts of coagulation factors (especially fibrinogen, prothrombin, platelets, and factor V and factor VIII), causing hypofibrinogenemia, hypoprothrombinemia, thrombocytopenia, and deficiencies in factor V and factor VIII. Circulating thrombin activates the fibrinolytic system, which lyses fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products. The hemorrhage that occurs may be due largely to the anticoagulant activity of fibrin degradation products, as well as depletion of plasma coagulation factors. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY THREE MECHANISMS OF DIC However disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) begins, accelerated clotting (characteristic of DIC) usually results in excess thrombin, which in turn causes fibrinolysis with excess fibrin formation and fibrin degradation products (FDP), activation of fibrin- stabilizing factor (factor XIII), consumption of platelet and clotting factors and, eventually, hemorrhage. P Complications Ischemia of legs, arms, or organs Severe bleeding Stroke Signs and symptoms The most significant feature of DIC is abnormal bleeding, without a history of a serious hemorrhagic disorder. Principal signs of such bleeding include cutaneous oozing, petechiae, ecchymoses, and hematomas caused by bleeding into the skin. Bleeding from surgical or I.V. sites and from the GI tract are equally significant signs, as are acrocyanosis (cyanosis of the extremities) and signs of acute tubular necrosis. Related signs, symptoms, and other effects include nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, oliguria, seizures, coma, shock, major organ failure, confusion, epistaxis, hemoptysis, and severe muscle, back, abdominal, and chest pain. Diagnosis Abnormal bleeding in the absence of a known hematologic disorder suggests DIC but may be late in the pathophysiologic process. Initial laboratory findings reflect coagulation factor deficiencies. decreased platelet count: less than 100,000/\\u00b5l decreased fibrinogen level: less than 150 mg/dl As the excessive clot breaks down, hemorrhagic diathesis occurs, and test results reflect coagulation abnormalities: prolonged prothrombin time: more than 15 seconds prolonged partial thromboplastin time: more than 60 seconds increased fibrin degradation products: commonly more than 45 mcg/ml. Other supportive data include positive fibrin monomers, diminished levels of factors V and VIII, fragmentation of red blood cells (RBCs), and decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level (less than 10 g/dl). Assessment of renal status demonstrates reduction in urine output (less than 30 ml/hour) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (more than 25 mg/dl) and serum creatinine (more than 1.3 mg/dl) levels. A positive D-dimer test (results less than 1:8 dilution and decreased levels of factors V and VIII) is specific for DIC. Confirming the diagnosis may be difficult because many of these test results also occur in other disorders (primary fibrinolysis, for example). Treatment Successful management of DIC necessitates prompt recognition and adequate treatment of the underlying disorder. Treatment\\nmay be supportive when the underlying disorder is self-limiting or highly specific. If the patient isn't bleeding, supportive care alone may reverse DIC. However, bleeding may require administration of blood, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, or packed RBCs to support hemostasis. Cryoprecipitates may also be used if fibrinogen is significantly decreased. Heparin is used in early stages to prevent microclotting and is sometimes used in combination with replacement therapy. Special considerations Patient care must focus on early recognition of abnormal bleeding, prompt treatment of the underlying disorders, and prevention of further bleeding. To avoid dislodging clots and causing fresh bleeding, don't scrub bleeding areas. Use pressure, cold compresses, and topical hemostatic agents to control bleeding. To prevent injury, enforce complete bed rest during bleeding episodes. If the patient is agitated, pad the side rails. Check all I.V. and venipuncture sites frequently for bleeding. Apply pressure to injection sites for at least 20 minutes. Alert other personnel to his tendency to hemorrhage. Monitor intake and output hourly in acute DIC, especially when administering blood products. Watch for transfusion\\nreactions and signs of fluid overload. To measure the amount of blood lost, weigh P dressings and linen, and record drainage. Weigh the patient daily, particularly if there's renal involvement. Watch for bleeding from the GI and genitourinary tracts. If you suspect intra-abdominal bleeding, measure the patient's abdominal girth at least every 4 hours, and monitor closely for signs of shock. Monitor the results of serial blood studies (particularly hematocrit, Hb levels, and coagulation times). Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures. Allow time for questions. Inform the patient's family of his progress. Prepare them for his appearance (I.V. lines, nasogastric tubes, bruises, and dried blood). Provide emotional support for the patient and his family. As needed, enlist the aid of a social worker, chaplain, and other members of the health care team in providing such support. MISCELLANEOUS DISORDERS Granulocytopenia and lymphocytopenia Granulocytopenia (also called agranulocytosis )\\nis characterized by a marked reduction in the number of circulating granulocytes. Although this implies all the granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) are reduced, granulocytopenia usually refers\\nto decreased neutrophils. (See Understanding neutropenia, page 538.)\\nThis disorder, which can occur at any age, is associated with infections and ulcerative lesions of the throat, GI tract, other mucous membranes, and skin. The severest form is known as agranulocytosis. Lymphocytopenia (sometimes called lymphopenia ), a rare disorder, is a deficiency of circulating lymphocytes (leukocytes produced mainly in lymph nodes). In both granulocytopenia and lymphocytopenia, the total leukocyte count (white blood cell [WBC] count) may reach dangerously low\\nlevels, leaving the body unprotected against infection. The prognosis in both disorders depends on the underlying cause and whether it can be treated. Untreated, severe granulocytopenia can be fatal in 3 to 6 days. P Causes Granulocytopenia may result from diminished production of\\ngranulocytes in bone marrow, increased peripheral destruction of granulocytes, or greater utilization of granulocytes. Diminished production of granulocytes in bone marrow generally stems from radiation\\nor drug therapy; it's a common adverse effect of antimetabolites and alkylating agents and may occur in the patient who is hypersensitive to phenothiazine, sulfonamides (and some sulfonamide derivatives), antibiotics, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Drug-induced granulocytopenia usually develops slowly and typically correlates with the dosage and duration of therapy. Production of granulocytes also decreases in conditions such as aplastic anemia and bone marrow malignancies and in some hereditary disorders (infantile genetic agranulocytosis). The growing loss of peripheral granulocytes is due to increased splenic sequestration, diseases that destroy peripheral blood cells (viral and bacterial infections), and drugs that act as haptens (carrying antigens that attack blood cells and causing acute idiosyncratic or non-dose- related drug reactions). Infections such as infectious mononucleosis may result in granulocytopenia because of increased utilization of granulocytes. Similarly, lymphocytopenia may result from decreased production, increased destruction, or loss of lymphocytes. Decreased production of lymphocytes may be secondary to a genetic or a thymic abnormality or to immunodeficiency disorders, such as thymic dysplasia or ataxiatelangiectasia. Increased destruction of lymphocytes may be secondary to radiation, chemotherapy, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Loss of lymphocytes may follow postsurgical thoracic duct drainage, intestinal lymphangiectasia, or impaired intestinal lymphatic drainage (as in Whipple's disease). Lymphocyte depletion can also result from elevated plasma\\ncorticoid levels (due to stress, corticotropin or steroid treatment, or\\nheart failure). Other disorders associated with lymphocyte depletion include Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, aplastic anemia, sarcoidosis, myasthenia gravis, lupus erythematosus, protein-calorie malnutrition, renal failure, terminal cancer, tuberculosis and, in infants, severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY UNDERSTANDING NEUTROPENIA Neutropenia, a deficiency in the number of mature neutrophils, is the most common immune system deficiency. It can result from a disease or from radiation or drug therapy. Common infections that\\noccur secondary to neutropenia include aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus and certain fungal infections, such as candidiasis and aspergillosis. Complication Infection Signs and symptoms Characteristically, patients with granulocytopenia experience slowly progressive fatigue and weakness; however, if they develop an infection, they can exhibit sudden onset of fever and chills and mental status changes. Overt signs of infection (pus formation) are usually absent. Localized infection can quickly become systemic (bacteremic) or spread throughout an organ (pneumonia). All patients should be meticulously evaluated for even subtle signs of infection because untreated infections can lead to septic shock in 8 to 24 hours. If granulocytopenia results from an idiosyncratic drug reaction, signs of infection develop abruptly, without slowly progressive fatigue and weakness. Patients with lymphocytopenia may exhibit enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils and signs of an associated disease. Diagnosis Diagnosis of granulocytopenia necessitates a thorough patient history to check for precipitating factors. Physical examination\\nfor clinical effects of underlying disorders is also essential. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A markedly decreased neutrophil count (less than 500/\\u00b5l leads to severe bacterial infections) and a WBC count lower than 2,000/\\u00b5l, with few observable granulocytes on complete blood count (CBC), confirm granulocytopenia. Bone marrow examination shows a scarcity of granulocytic precursor cells beyond the most immature forms, but this may vary, depending on the cause. A lymphocyte count below 1,500/\\u00b5l in adults or below 3,000/\\u00b5l in children indicates lymphocytopenia. Identifying the cause by\\nevaluation of clinical status, bone marrow and lymph node biopsies, or other appropriate diagnostic tests helps establish the diagnosis. Treatment P Effective management of granulocytopenia must identify and eliminate the cause and control infection until the bone marrow can generate more leukocytes. In\\nmany cases, this means drug or radiation therapy must be stopped and antibiotic treatment begun immediately, even while awaiting test results. Treatment may also include an-tifungal preparations. Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF is a newer treatment used to stimulate bone marrow production of neutrophils. Spontaneous restoration of leukocyte production in bone marrow generally occurs within 1 to 3 weeks. Treatment of lymphocytopenia includes eliminating the cause and managing any underlying disorders. For infants with SCID, therapy may include bone marrow transplantation. Special considerations Monitor vital signs frequently. Obtain cultures from blood, throat, urine, mouth, nose, rectum, vagina, and sputum, as ordered. Give antibiotics as scheduled. Explain the necessity of infection protection procedures to the patient and his family. Teach proper hand-washing technique and the correct use of gowns and masks. Prevent patient contact with staff or visitors with respiratory infections. Maintain adequate nutrition and hydration because malnutrition aggravates immunosuppression. Make sure the patient\\nwith mouth ulcerations receives a high-calorie liquid diet. Offer a straw to make drinking less painful. Provide warm saline water gargles and rinses, analgesics, and anesthetic lozenges. Good oral hygiene promotes comfort and facilitates healing. Ensure adequate rest, which is essential to the mobilization of the body's defenses against infection. Provide good skin and perineal care. Monitor CBC and differential, blood culture results, serum electrolyte levels, intake and output, and daily weight. P To help detect granulocytopenia and lymphocytopenia in the early, most treatable stages, monitor the WBC count of any patient receiving radiation or chemotherapy. After the patient has developed bone marrow depression, he must zealously avoid exposure to infection. Advise the patient with known or suspected\\nsensitivity to a drug that may lead to granulocytopenia or lymphocytopenia to alert medical personnel to this sensitivity in the future. Hypersplenism Hypersplenism is a syndrome marked by exaggerated splenic\\nactivity and, possibly, splenomegaly. This disorder results in peripheral blood cell deficiency as the spleen traps and destroys peripheral blood cells. Causes Hypersplenism may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to\\nan extrasplenic disorder, such as chronic malaria, polycythemia vera, or rheumatoid arthritis. (See Causes of splenomegaly, page 540.)\\nIn hypersplenism, the spleen's normal filtering and phagocytic functions accelerate indiscriminately, automatically removing antibody-coated, aging, and abnormal cells, even though some cells may be functionally normal. The spleen may also temporarily sequester normal\\nplatelets and red blood cells (RBCs), withholding them from circulation. In this manner, the enlarged spleen may trap as much as 90%\\nof the body's platelets and up to 45% of its RBC mass. Signs and symptoms Most patients with hypersplenism develop anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, in many cases with splenomegaly. They may contract bacterial infections frequently, bruise easily, hemorrhage spontaneously from the mucous membranes and GI or genitourinary tract, and suffer ulcerations of the mouth, legs, and feet. They commonly develop fever, weakness, and palpitations. Patients with secondary hypersplenism may have other clinical abnormalities, depending on the underlying disease. CAUSES OF SPLENOMEGALY Infectious Acute (abscesses, subacute infective endocarditis), chronic (tuberculosis, malaria, Felty's syndrome) Congestive Cirrhosis, thrombosis Hyperplastic Hemolytic anemia, polycythemia vera Infiltrative Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease Cystic or neoplastic Cysts, leukemia, lymphoma, myelofibrosis Diagnosis Diagnosis requires evidence of abnormal splenic destruction or sequestration of RBCs or platelets and splenomegaly. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The most definitive test measures erythrocytes in the spleen and liver after I.V. infusion of chromium-labeled RBCs or platelets. A high spleen-liver ratio of radioactivity indicates splenic destruction or sequestration. Complete blood count shows decreased hemoglobin level (as\\nlow as 4 g/dl), white blood cell count (less than 4,000/mcl), and platelet count (less than 125,000/mcl) and an elevated reticulocyte count (more than 75,000/mcl). Splenic biopsy, scan, and angiography may be useful; biopsy is hazardous and should be avoided if possible. In sequestration, the spleen is palpable. Use abdominal palpation cautiously because it may create injury, bleeding, or rupture. Treatment Splenectomy is indicated only in transfusion-dependent patients who are refractory to medical therapy. Splenectomy seldom cures\\nthe patient, but it does correct the effects of cytopenia. Postoperative complications may include infection and thromboembolic disease. Occasionally, splenectomy may result in accelerated blood cell destruction in the bone marrow and liver. Secondary hypersplenism necessitates treatment of the underlying disease. Special considerations If splenectomy is scheduled, administer preoperative transfusions of blood or blood products (fresh frozen plasma and platelets) to replace deficient blood elements. Also treat symptoms or complications of any underlying disorder. Postoperatively, monitor vital signs. Check for any excessive drainage or apparent bleeding. Watch for infection, thromboembolism, and abdominal distention. Keep the nasogastric tube patent; listen for bowel sounds. Instruct the patient to perform deep-breathing exercises, and encourage early ambulation to prevent respiratory complications and venous stasis. ELDER TIP Older adults may be at higher risk for infection because of decreased leukocyte and lymphocyte production. Fewer and weaker lymphocytes and immune system changes diminish the antigen-antibody response in older adults.

            "    \"__intro__\": \" Introduction Metabolism is the physiologic process that allows cells to transform food into energy and continually rebuild body cells. Metabolism has two phases: catabolism and anabolism. In catabolism, the energyproducing phase of metabolism, the body breaks down large food molecules into smaller ones; in anabolism, the tissue-building phase, the body converts small molecules into larger ones (such as antibodies to keep the body capable of fighting infection). Both phases are accomplished by means of a chemical process using energy. A wide range of nutrients is metabolized to meet the body's needs. (See Essential nutrients and their functions .) ELDER TIP A person's protein, vitamin, and mineral requirements usually remain the same as he ages, although calorie needs decline. Diminished activity may lower energy requirements\\nby almost 200 calories per day for men and women ages 51 to 75, 400 calories per day for women older than age 75, and 500 calories per day for men older than age 75. Carbohydrates: Primary energy source The body gets most of its energy by metabolizing carbohydrates, especially glucose. Glucose catabolism proceeds in three phases: Glycolysis, a series of chemical reactions, converts glucose molecules into pyruvic or lactic acid. The citric acid cycle removes ionized hydrogen atoms from pyruvic acid and produces carbon dioxide. Oxidative phosphorylation traps energy from the hydrogen electrons and combines the hydrogen ions\\nand electrons with oxygen to form water and the common form of biologic\\nenergy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other essential processes in carbohydrate metabolism include glycogenesis\\u2014 the formation of glycogen, a storage form of glucose\\u2014 which occurs when cells become saturated with glucose-6-phosphate (an intermediate product of glycolysis); glycogenolysis, the reverse process, which converts glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate in muscle cells and liberates free glucose in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, or \\u201cnew\\u201d glucose formation from protein amino acids or fat glycerols. A complex interplay of hormonal and neural controls regulates glucose metabolism. Hormone secretions of five endocrine glands dominate this regulatory function: Alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete glucagon, which increases the blood glucose level by stimulating\\nphosphorylase activity to accelerate liver glycogenolysis. Beta cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete the glucose-regulating hormone insulin, which assists in glucose\\ntransport across cell membranes and storage of excess glucose as fat. The adrenal medulla, as a physiologic response to stress, secretes epinephrine, which stimulates liver and muscle glycogenolysis to increase the blood glucose level. Corticotropin and glucocorticoids also increase blood glucose levels. Glucocorticoids accelerate gluconeogenesis by promoting the flow of amino acids to the liver, where\\nthey're synthesized into glucose. Human growth hormone (hGH) limits the fat storage and favors fat catabolism; consequently, it inhibits carbohydrate catabolism and thus raises blood glucose levels. P Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormone have mixed effects on carbohydrate metabolism and may raise or lower blood glucose levels. Fats: Catabolism and anabolism The breaking up of triglycerides\\u2014 lipolysis \\u2014yields fatty acids and glycerol. Betaoxidation breaks down fatty acids\\ninto acetyl coenzyme A, which can then enter the citric acid cycle; glycerol can also undergo gluconeogenesis or enter the glycolytic pathways to produce energy. Conversely, lipogenesis is the chemical formation of fat from excess carbohydrates and proteins\\nor from the fatty acids and glycerol products of lipolysis. Adipose tissue is the primary storage site for excess fat and thus is the greatest source of energy reserve. Certain unsaturated fatty acids are necessary for synthesis of vital body compounds. Because the body can't produce these essential fatty acids, they must be provided through diet. Insulin, hGH, catecholamines, corticotropin, and glucocorticoids control fat metabolism in an inverse relationship with carbohydrate metabolism; large amounts of carbohydrates promote fat storage, and deficiency of available carbohydrates promotes fat breakdown for energy needs. ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS Nutrients are required for the body to work properly and avoid disease. Nutrients Functions Carbohydrates \\u25aa Energy source Fats and essential fatty acids \\u25aa Energy source; essential for growth, normal skin, and membranes Proteins and amino acids \\u25aa Synthesis of all body proteins, growth, and tissue maintenance Water-soluble vitamins: \\u25aa Ascorbic acid (C) \\u25aa Collagen synthesis, wound healing, antioxidation \\u25aa Thiamine (B 1 ) \\u25aa Coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism \\u25aa Riboflavin (B 2 ) \\u25aa Coenzyme in energy metabolism \\u25aa Niacin \\u25aa Coenzyme in carbohydrate, fat, energy metabolism, and tissue metabolism \\u25aa Vitamin B 12 \\u25aa Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid synthesis; erythrocyte formation \\u25aa Folic acid \\u25aa Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism; heme and hemoglobin formation; DNA synthesis; lowering homocysteine levels Fats soluble vitamins: \\u25aa Vitamin A \\u25aa Vision in dim light, mucosal epithelium integrity, tooth development, endocrine function \\u25aa Vitamin D \\u25aa Regulation of calcium and phosphate absorption and metabolism; renal phosphate clearance \\u25aa Vitamin E \\u25aa Antioxidation; essential for muscle, liver, and red blood cell integrity \\u25aa Vitamin K \\u25aa Blood clotting (catalyzes synthesis of prothrombin by liver) Proteins: Anabolism The primary process in protein metabolism is anabolism. Catabolism is relegated to a supporting role in protein metabolism \\u2014a reversal of the roles played by these two processes in carbohydrate and fat metabolisms. By synthesizing proteins\\u2014 the tissue-building foods\\u2014the body derives substances essential for life (such as plasma proteins) and can reproduce, control cell growth, and repair itself. However, when carbohydrates or fats are unavailable as energy sources, or when energy P demands are exceedingly high, protein catabolism converts protein into an available energy source. Protein metabolism consists of many processes, including: Deamination \\u2014 a\\ncatabolic and energyproducing process occurring in the liver with the splitting off of the amino acid to form ammonia and a keto acid Transamination \\u2014 anabolic conversion of keto acids to amino acids Urea formation \\u2014 a catabolic process occurring in the liver, producing urea, the end product of protein catabolism. The male hormone testosterone and hGH stimulate protein anabolism; corticotropin prompts secretion of glucocorticoids, which, in\\nturn, facilitate protein catabolism. Normally, the rate of protein anabolism equals the rate of protein catabolism \\u2014a condition known as nitrogen balance (because ingested nitrogen equals nitrogen waste excreted in urine, feces, and sweat). When excessive catabolism causes the amount of nitrogen excreted to exceed the amount ingested, a state of negative nitrogen balance exists\\u2014usually the result of starvation and cachexia or surgical stress. Fluid and electrolyte balance A critical component of metabolism is fluid and electrolyte balance. Water is an essential body substance and constitutes almost 60% of an adult's body weight and more than 75% of a neonate's body weight. In both older and obese adults, the ratio of water to body weight drops; children and lean people have a higher proportion of water in their bodies. Body fluids can be classified as intracellular (or cellular) or extracellular. Intracellular fluid constitutes about 40% of\\ntotal body weight and 60% of all body fluid; it contains large quantities of potassium and phosphates but very little sodium and chloride. Conversely, extracellular fluid (ECF) contains mostly sodium and chloride but very little potassium and phosphates. Incorporating interstitial, cerebrospinal, intraocular, and GI fluids and plasma, ECF supplies cells with nutrients and other substances needed for cellular function. The many components of body fluids have the important function\\nof preserving osmotic pressure and acid-base and anion-cation balance. Homeostasis is a stable state\\u2014the equilibrium of chemical\\nand physical properties of body fluid. Body fluids contain two kinds of\\ndissolved substances: those that dissociate in solution (electrolytes) and those that don't. For example, glucose, when dissolved in water, doesn't break down into smaller particles; but sodium chloride dissociates in solution into sodium cations (+) and chloride anions (-).\\nThe composition of these electrolytes in body fluids is electrically balanced so the positively charged ions (cations: sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) equal the negatively charged ions (anions: chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, phosphate, proteinate, and carbonic and other organic acids). Although these particles are present in relatively\\nlow concentrations, any deviation from their normal levels can have profound physiologic effects. ELDER TIP Institutionalized older people are at particularly high risk for dehydration because of their diminished thirst perception and any combination of physical, cognitive, speech, mobility, and visual impairment. In homeostasis\\u2014an ever-changing but balanced state\\u2014water and electrolytes and other solutes move continually between cellular and extracellular compartments. Such motion is made possible by semiper- meable membranes that allow diffusion, filtration, and active transport. Diffusion refers to the movement of particles or molecules from an area of greater concentration to one of lesser concentration. Normally, particles move randomly and constantly until the concentrations within given solutions are equal. Diffusion also depends on permeability, electrical gradient, and pressure gradient. Particles, however, can't diffuse against any of these gradients without energy and\\na carrier substance (active transport). ATP is released from cells to aid particles needing energy to pass through the cell membrane. The diffusion of water from a solution of low concentration to one of high concentration is called osmosis. The pressure that develops when a selectively permeable cell membrane separates solutions of different strengths of concentrations is known as osmotic pressure, expressed in P terms of osmols or milliosmols (mOsm). Osmotic activity is described in terms of osmolality \\u2014 the osmotic pull exerted by all particles per unit of water, expressed in mOsm/ kg of water\\u2014or osmolarity, when expressed in mOsm/L of solution. The normal range of body fluid osmolality is 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. Solutions of 50 mOsm above or below the high and low points of this normal range exert little or no osmotic effect (isosmolality). A solution below 240 mOsm contains a lower particle concentration than plasma (hypoosmolar) while a solution over 340 mOsm has a higher particle concentration than plasma (hyperosmolar). Rapid I.V. administration of isosmolar solutions to patients who are debilitated, are very old or very young, or have cardiac or renal insufficiency could lead to ECF volume overload and induce pulmonary edema and heart failure because particulate concentration is the same as plasma, so fluid shifting into and out of cells will occur. Continuous I.V. administration of hypoosmolar solutions decreases serum osmolality and leads to excess intracellular fluid volume (water intoxication), whereas continuous I.V. administration of hyperosmolar solutions results in intracellular dehydration, increased serum osmolality and, eventually, ECF volume deficit due to excessive urinary excretion. These states occur because of fluid diffusion and the\\ncell's attempt to balance the particulate concentrations inside and outside the cell. Regulation of pH Primarily through the complex chemical regulation of carbonic acid by the lungs and of base bicarbonate by the kidneys, the body maintains the hydrogen ion concentration to keep the ECF pH between\\n7.35 and 7.45. Nutritional deficiency or excess, disease, injury, or metabolic disturbance can interfere with normal homeostatic mechanisms and raise pH (acidosis) or lower it (alkalosis). Assessing homeostasis The goal of metabolism and homeostasis is to maintain the\\ncomplex environment of ECF\\u2014the plasma\\u2014which nourishes and supports every body cell. This special environment is subject to multiple interlocking influences and readily reflects any disturbance in nutrition, chemical or fluid content, and osmotic pressure. Such disturbances can be detected by various laboratory tests. For example, measurements of albumin, prealbumin, and other blood proteins; electrolyte concentration; enzyme and antibody levels; and urine and blood chemistry levels (lipoproteins, glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, and creatinine-height index) accurately reflect the state of metabolism, homeostasis, and nutrition throughout the body. (See Laboratory tests: Assessing nutritional status, page 546.)\\nResults of such laboratory tests, of course, supplement the information\\nobtained from dietary history and physical examination\\u2014which offer gross clinical information about the quality, quantity, and efficiency of metabolic processes. To support clinical information, anthropometry, height-weight ratio, and skin-fold thickness determinations specifically\\ndefine tissue nutritional status. The following measures can help you maintain your patient's homeostasis. Obtain a complete dietary history and nutritional assessment to determine if carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamin, mineral, and water intake are adequate for energy production and for tissue repair and growth. Remember that during periods of rapid tissue synthesis (growth, pregnancy, healing), protein needs increase. Consult a dietitian about any patient who may be malnourished because of malabsorption syndromes, renal or hepatic\\ndisease, clear- liquid diets, or who may possibly receive nothing by mouth for more than 5 days. Planned meals that provide adequate carbohydrates, fats, and protein are necessary for convalescence. Supplementary carbohydrates are often needed to spare protein and achieve a positive nitrogen balance. Accurately record intake and output to assess fluid balance (this includes intake of oral liquids or I.V. solutions, and urine, gastric, and stool output). Weigh the patient daily\\u2014at the same time, with the same-type clothing, and on the same scale. Remember, a weight loss of 2.2 lb (1 kg) is equivalent to the loss of 1 L of fluid. P Observe the patient closely for insensible\\nwater or unmeasured fluid losses (such as through diaphoresis). Remember, fluid loss from the skin and lungs (normally 900 ml/ day) can reach as high as 2,000 ml/day from hyperventilation or tachypnea, thus increasing insensible water losses. ELDER TIP Teach elderly patients and others vulnerable to fluid imbalances the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake. LABORATORY TESTS: ASSESSING NUTRITIONAL STATUS Blood and urine tests provide the most precise data about\\nnutritional status, often revealing nutritional problems before they're\\nclinically apparent. The list below explains some common tests and what\\ntheir results mean. Serum vitamins and minerals Vitamin and mineral deficiencies commonly screened for include A, B, B 12 , folic acid, ascorbic acid, beta carotene, riboflavin and, sometimes, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, and other minerals. Serum nutrients Glucose levels help assess suspected diabetes or hypoglycemia. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels help differentiate the\\ntype of hyperlipoproteinemia. Nitrogen balance A negative nitrogen balance indicates inadequate intake of protein or calories. Hemoglobin and hematocrit Decreased levels can occur in protein-calorie malnutrition, iron deficiency, overhydration, hemorrhage, and hemolytic disease; elevated levels in dehydration, polycythemia, and folate and B 12 deficiency. Serum albumin Reduced levels may indicate overhydration or visceral protein depletion because of GI disease, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome. Elevated levels occur in dehydration. Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing One or more positive responses, in 24 to 48 hours, to intradermally injected common recall antigens indicates intact cell-mediated immunity. Negative, delayed, or absent response may indicate protein-calorie malnutrition but may also be seen in patients on steroids or with cancer, as well as patients with shock or sepsis. Creatinine-height index (CHI) This calculated value reflects muscle mass and estimates muscle protein depletion. Reduced CHI may indicate protein-calorie malnutrition or impaired renal function. Serum prealbumin This carrier protein for thyroxine is a sensitive indicator of visceral protein. Total lymphocyte count This provides an indication of immune status. Counts are low in malnutrition and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Recognize I.V. solutions that are hyposmolar, such as 0.45% NaCl (half- normal saline solution). Isosmolar solutions include normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 5% dextrose in 0.2% NaCl, Ringer's solutions, and 5% dextrose in water. (The latter acts like a hypotonic solution because dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving only free water.) Hyperosmolar solutions include 5% dextrose in normal saline solution, 10% dextrose in water, and 5% dextrose in Ringer's lactate solution. P When continuously administering hypoosmolar solutions, watch for signs of water intoxication: headaches,\\nbehavior changes (confusion or disorientation), nausea, vomiting, rising blood pressure, and falling pulse rate. When continuously administering hyperosmolar solutions, be alert for signs of hypovolemia: thirst, dry mucous membranes, slightly falling blood pressure, rising pulse rate and\\nrespirations, low-grade fever (99\\u00b0 F [37.2\\u00b0 C]), and elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and BUN levels. Administer fluid cautiously, especially to\\nthe patient with cardiopulmonary or renal disease, and watch for signs of overhydration: constant and irritating cough, dyspnea, moist crackles, rising central venous pressure, and pitting edema (late sign). When the patient is in an upright position, neck and hand vein engorgement is a sign of fluid overload. ELDER TIP Many older patients take drugs to treat a variety of conditions. Remember that drugs can affect the patient's nutritional status by altering nutrient absorption, metabolism, utilization, or excretion. Likewise, various foods, beverages, and mineral or vitamin supplements can affect the absorption and effectiveness of drugs. Be aware of these potential interactions when evaluating the patient's medication regimen and nutritional status. NUTRITIONAL IMBALANCE Vitamin A deficiency A fat-soluble vitamin absorbed in the GI tract, vitamin A\\nmaintains epithelial tissue and retinal function. Consequently, deficiency of this vitamin may result in night blindness, decreased color adjustment, keratinization of epithelial tissue, and poor bone growth. Healthy adults have adequate vitamin A reserves to last up to a year; children often don't. Causes and incidence Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intake of foods high in vitamin A (liver, kidney, butter, milk, cream, cheese, and fortified margarine) or carotene, a precursor of vitamin A found in dark green leafy vegetables and yellow or orange fruits and vegetables. (Six mg of beta-carotene is equal to 1 mg of vitamin A.) The\\nrecommended daily allowance for vitamin A is 1 mg for adult males and 0.8 mg for adult females. Less common causes include: malabsorption due to celiac disease, sprue, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis, or habitual use of mineral oil as a laxative massive urinary excretion caused by cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, nephritis, or urinary tract infection decreased storage and transport of vitamin A due to hepatic disease. Each year, more than 80,000 people worldwide\\u2014mostly children in underdeveloped countries\\u2014lose their sight from severe vitamin A deficiency. This condition is rare in the United States, although many disadvantaged children have substandard levels of vitamin A. With therapy, the chance of reversing symptoms of night blindness and\\nmilder conjunctival changes is excellent. When corneal damage is present, emergency treatment is necessary. Complication Corneal damage Signs and symptoms Typically, the first symptom of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (nyctalopia), which usually becomes apparent when the patient enters a dark place or is caught in the glare of oncoming headlights while driving at night. This condition can progress to xerophthalmia, or drying of the P 8 conjunctivas, with development of gray plaques (Bitot's spots); if unchecked, perforation, scarring, and blindness may result. Keratinization of epithelial tissue causes dry, scaly skin; follicular hyperkeratosis; and shrinking and hardening of the mucous membranes, possibly leading to infections of the eyes and the\\nrespiratory or genitourinary tract. An infant with severe vitamin A deficiency shows signs of failure to thrive and apathy, along with dry skin and corneal changes, which can lead to ulceration and rapid destruction of the cornea. Diagnosis Dietary history and typical ocular lesions suggest vitamin A deficiency. Carotene levels less than 40 mcg/dl also suggest vitamin A deficiency, but they vary with seasonal ingestion of fruits and vegetables. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum level of vitamin A that falls below 10 mcg/dl confirms the diagnosis. Levels between 10 and 19 mcg/dl are also considered low but the patient isn't likely to have developed significant symptoms. RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE OF B-COMPLEX VITAMINS Vitamin Men (23 to 50) Women (23 to 50) Infants Children (1 to 10) B 1 * 1.4 mg 1 mg 0.4 mg 0.7 to 1.2 mg B 2 * 1.6 mg 1.2 mg 0.5 mg 0.8 to 1.4 mg Niacin * 18 mg 13 mg 5 to 8 mg 9 to 16 mg B 6 2.2 mg 2 mg 0.4 mg 0.9 to 1.6 mg B 12 3 mcg 3 mcg 0.3 mcg 2 to 3 mcg * requirements per 1,000 kilocalories of dietary intake Treatment Mild conjunctival changes or night blindness requires vitamin A replacement in the form of cod liver oil or halibut liver oil.\\nAcute deficiency requires aqueous vitamin A solution I.M., especially when corneal changes have occurred. Therapy for underlying biliary obstruction consists of administration of bile salts; for pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatin. Dry skin responds well to cream-based or petroleum-based products. In patients with chronic malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and in those with low dietary intake, prevention of vitamin A deficiency requires aqueous I.V. supplements or an oral water-miscible preparation. Special considerations Administer oral vitamin A supplements with\\nor after meals or parenterally, as indicated. Watch for signs of hypercarotenemia (orange coloration of the skin and eyes) and hypervitaminosis A (rash, hair loss, anorexia, transient hydrocephalus, and vomiting in children; bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, diplopia, and irritability in adults). If these signs occur, discontinue supplements and notify the physician immediately. (Hypercarotenemia is relatively harmless; hypervitaminosis A may be toxic.) PREVENTION Because vitamin A deficiency usually\\nresults from dietary insufficiency, provide nutritional counseling. Tell the patient that vitamin A comes from animal sources, such as eggs,\\nmeat, milk, cheese, cream, liver, kidney, and cod and halibut fish oil,\\nbut that healthier choices, such as carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and most dark green, leafy vegetables are good sources of beta- carotene,\\nvitamin A's precursor form. Instruct the patient that the more intense the color of a fruit or vegetable, P the higher its beta-carotene content.\\nProvide referrals to appropriate community agencies if necessary. Vitamin B deficiencies Vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble vitamins essential to normal metabolism, cell growth, and blood formation. (See Recommended daily allowance of B-complex vitamins. ) The most common deficiencies involve thiamine (B 1 ), riboflavin (B 2 ), niacin, pyridoxine (B 6 ), and cobalamin (B 12 ). Causes and incidence Thiamine deficiency results from malabsorption or inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B 1 . It also results from alcoholism, prolonged diarrhea, or from increased requirement, which can occur in pregnancy, lactation, and hyperthyroidism. Beriberi, a serious thiamine- deficiency disease, is most prevalent in Asians, who subsist mainly on diets of unenriched rice and wheat. Although this disease is uncommon in the United States, alcoholics may develop cardiac (wet) beriberi with high-output heart failure, neuropathy, and cerebral disturbances. In times of stress (pregnancy, for example), malnourished young adults may develop beriberi; infantile beriberi may appear in infants on low-protein diets or in those breast-fed by thiamine-deficient mothers. Riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) results from a diet deficient in milk, meat, fish, legumes, and green, leafy vegetables. Alcoholism or prolonged diarrhea may also induce riboflavin deficiency. Exposure of milk to sunlight or treatment of legumes with baking soda can destroy riboflavin. Niacin deficiency, in its advanced form, produces pellagra, which affects the skin, central nervous system (CNS), and GI tract. (See Recognizing pellagra. )\\nAlthough this deficiency is now seldom found in the United States, it was once common among Southerners who subsisted mainly on corn and consumed minimal animal protein. (Corn is low in niacin and in available\\ntryptophan, the amino acid from which the body synthesizes niacin.) Niacin deficiency is still common in parts of Egypt, Romania, Africa, Serbia, and Montenegro, where corn is the dominant staple food. Niacin deficiency can also occur secondary to carcinoid syndrome or Hartnup disease. Pyridoxine deficiency usually results from destruction of\\npyridoxine in infant formulas by autoclaving. A frank deficiency is uncommon in adults, except in patients taking pyridoxine antagonists, such as isoniazid and penicillamine. Cobalamin deficiency most commonly results from an absence of intrinsic factor in gastric secretions, or an absence of receptor sites after ileal resection. Other causes include malabsorption\\nsyndromes associated with sprue, intestinal worm infestation, regional ileitis, and gluten enteropathy, and a diet low in animal protein. RECOGNIZING PELLAGRA This patient with pellagra shows dark, scaly, advanced dermatitis. In advanced niacin deficiency, such dermatitis usually occurs on areas exposed to the sun. Signs and symptoms P Thiamine deficiency causes polyneuritis and, possibly, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. In infants (infantile beriberi), this deficiency produces edema, irritability, abdominal pain, pallor, vomiting, loss of voice and, possibly, seizures.\\nIn wet beriberi, severe edema starts in the legs and moves up through the body; dry beriberi causes multiple neurologic symptoms and an emaciated appearance. Thiamine deficiency may also cause cardiomegaly, palpitations, tachycardia, dyspnea, and circulatory collapse. Constipation and indigestion are common; ataxia, nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia are also possible. Riboflavin deficiency characteristically causes cheilosis\\n(cracking of the lips and corners of the mouth), sore throat, and glossitis. It may also cause seborrheic dermatitis in the nasolabial folds, scrotum, and vulva and, possibly, generalized dermatitis involving the arms, legs, and trunk. This deficiency can also affect the eyes, producing burning, itching, light sensitivity, tearing, and vascularization of the corneas. Late-stage riboflavin deficiency causes neuropathy, mild anemia and, in children, growth retardation. Niacin deficiency in its early stages produces fatigue, anorexia, muscle weakness, headache, indigestion, mild skin eruptions, weight loss, and backache. In advanced stages (pellagra), it produces dark, scaly dermatitis, especially on exposed body parts, that makes the\\npatient appear to be severely sunburned. The mouth, tongue, and lips become red and sore, which may interfere with eating. Common GI symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Associated CNS aberrations\\u2014 confusion, disorientation, and neuritis\\u2014may become severe enough to induce hallucinations and paranoia. Because of this triad of symptoms, pellagra is sometimes called a \\u201c3-D\\u201d syndrome\\u2014dementia, dermatitis, and diarrhea. If not reversed by therapeutic doses of niacin, pellagra can be fatal. Pyridoxine deficiency in infants causes a wide range of symptoms: dermatitis, occasional cheilosis or glossitis unresponsive to riboflavin therapy, abdominal pain, vomiting, ataxia, and seizures. This\\ndeficiency can also lead to CNS disturbances. Cobalamin deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which produces anorexia, weight loss, abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, and glossitis; peripheral neuropathy; and, possibly, ataxia, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Diagnosis The following values confirm vitamin B deficiency. Thiamine deficiency \\u2014commonly\\nmeasured as micrograms per deciliter in a 24-hour urine collection. Deficiency levels are age-related: 1 to 3 years, less than 120; 4 to 6 years, less than 85; 7 to 9 years, less than 70; 10 to12 years, less than 60; 13 to 15 years, less than 50; adults, less than 27; pregnant women, less than 23 (second trimester), less than 21 (third trimester). Riboflavin deficiency \\u2014measured\\nas micrograms per gram of creatinine in a 24-hour urine collection. Deficiency levels are age-related: 1 to 3 years, less than 150; 4 to 6 years, less than 100; 7 to 9 years, less than 85; 10 to 15 years, less than 70; adults, less than 27; pregnant women, less than 39 (second trimester); less than 30 (third trimester). Niacin deficiency \\u2014measured\\nby Nmethyl nicotinamide in a 24-hour urine collection as micrograms per\\ngram of creatinine. Deficiency levels are: adults, less than 0.5; first\\ntrimester of pregnancy, less than 0.5; second trimester, less than 0.6;\\nthird trimester, less than 0.8. Pyridoxine deficiency \\u2014xanthurenic\\nacid more than 50 mg/day in 24- hour urine collection after administration of 10 g of L-tryptophan; decreased levels of serum and red blood cell transaminases; reduced excretion of pyridoxic acid in urine. Cobalamin deficiency \\u2014cobalamin\\nserum levels less than 150 pg/ml. Tests to discover the deficiency's cause include gastric analysis and hemoglobin studies. In addition, the Schilling test measures absorption of radioactive cobalamin with and without intrinsic factor. Treatment Diet and supplementary vitamins can correct or prevent vitamin B deficiencies, as follows. Thiamine deficiency \\u2014a\\nhigh-protein diet, with adequate calorie intake, possibly supplemented by B-complex vitamins for early P symptoms. Thiamine-rich foods include pork, peas, wheat bran, oatmeal, and liver. Alcoholic beriberi may require thiamine supplements or thiamine hydrochloride as part of a B-complex concentrate. Riboflavin deficiency \\u2014supplemental\\nriboflavin in patients with intractable diarrhea or increased need for riboflavin related to growth, pregnancy, lactation, or wound healing. Good sources of riboflavin are meats, enriched flour, milk and dairy products, green, leafy vegetables, eggs, and cereal. Acute riboflavin deficiency requires daily oral doses of riboflavin alone or with other B-complex vitamins. Riboflavin phosphate can also be administered I.V. or I.M. Niacin deficiency \\u2014supplemental\\nB-complex vitamins and dietary enrichment in patients at risk because of marginal diets or alcoholism. Meats, fish, peanuts, brewer's yeast, enriched breads, and cereals are rich in niacin; milk and eggs, in tryptophan. Confirmed niacin deficiency requires daily doses of niacinamide orally or I.V. Pyridoxine deficiency \\u2014prophylactic\\npyridoxine therapy in infants and in children with a seizure disorder; supplemental B-complex vitamins in patients with anorexia, malabsorption, or those taking isoniazid or penicillamine. Some women who take hormonal contraceptives may have to supplement their diets with\\npyridoxine. Confirmed pyridoxine deficiencies require oral or parenteral pyridoxine. Children with convulsive seizures stemming from metabolic dysfunction may require daily doses of 200 to 600 mg pyridoxine. Cobalamin deficiency \\u2014parenteral\\ncobalamin in patients with reduced gastric secretion of hydrochloric acid, lack of intrinsic factor, some malabsorption syndromes, or ileum resections. Strict vegetarians may have to supplement their diets with oral vitamin B 12 . Depending on the deficiency's severity, supplementary cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamine is usually given parenterally for 5 to 10 days, followed by monthly or daily vitamin B 12 supplements. Special considerations An accurate dietary history provides a baseline for effective dietary counseling. Identify and observe patients who are at risk for vitamin B deficiencies \\u2014alcoholics, the elderly, pregnant women,\\noral hormonal contraceptive users (vitamins B 6 and B 12 ), and people on limited diets. Administer prescribed supplements. Make sure patients understand how important it is that they adhere strictly to their prescribed treatment for the rest of their lives. Watch for adverse effects from large doses of niacinamide, such as a flushed sensation or hot flashes, in patients with niacin deficiency. Remember, prolonged intake of niacin can cause hepatic dysfunction. Caution patients with Parkinson's disease receiving pyridoxine that this drug can impair response to levodopa therapy. Explain all tests and procedures. Reassure\\npatients that, with treatment, the prognosis is good. Refer patients to\\nappropriate assistance agencies if their diets are inadequate due to adverse socioeconomic conditions. PREVENTION Encourage the patient to follow a well-balanced diet. Vitamin B 12 injections can prevent anemia after surgeries known to cause B 12 deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency leads to scurvy or inadequate production of collagen, an extracellular substance that binds\\nthe cells of the teeth, bones, and capillaries. It's essential for wound healing and burn recovery. Vitamin C is also an important factor in metabolizing such amino acids as tyrosine and phenylalanine. It also acts as a reductant, activating enzymes in the body, as well as converting folic acid into useful components. Severe vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy, evident by hemorrhagic tendencies and abnormal osteoid and dentin formation. P Causes and incidence This deficiency's primary cause is a diet lacking in vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, spinach, and berries. Because the body can't store this water-soluble vitamin in large amounts, the supply needs to be replenished daily. Other causes include: destruction of vitamin C in foods by overexposure to air or by overcooking excessive ingestion of vitamin C during pregnancy, which causes the neonate to require large amounts of the vitamin after birth marginal intake of vitamin C during periods of physiologic stress\\u2014 caused by infectious disease, for example\\u2014which can deplete tissue saturation of vitamin C. Historically common among sailors and others deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for long periods of time, vitamin C deficiency is uncommon today in the United States, except in alcoholics,\\npeople on restricted-residue diets, and infants weaned from breast milk\\nto cow's milk without a vitamin C supplement. SCURVY'S EFFECT ON GUMS AND LEGS In adults, scurvy causes swollen or bleeding gums and loose teeth. It also causes follicular hyperkeratosis, usually on the legs. Complication Scurvy Signs and symptoms Clinical features of vitamin C deficiency appear as capillaries become increasingly fragile. In an adult, it produces petechiae, ecchymoses, follicular hyperkeratosis (especially on the buttocks and legs), anemia, anorexia, limb and joint pain (especially in\\nthe knees), pallor, weakness, swollen or bleeding gums, loose teeth, lethargy, insomnia, poor wound healing, and ocular hemorrhages in the bulbar conjunctivae. (See Scurvy's effect on gums and legs .)\\nVitamin C deficiency can also cause beading, fractures of the costochondral junctions of the ribs or epiphysis, and such psychological\\ndisturbances as irritability, depression, hysteria, and hypochondriasis. In a child, vitamin C deficiency produces tender, painful\\nswelling in the legs, causing the child to lie with his legs partially flexed. Other P symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum ascorbic acid levels less than\\n0.2 mg/ dl and white blood cell ascorbic acid levels less than 30 mg/dl\\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. Dietary history revealing an inadequate intake of ascorbic acid suggests vitamin C deficiency. A capillary fragility test may be performed on the patient's forearm with a blood pressure cuff; it's positive if more than 10 petechiae form after 5 minutes of pressure. Treatment Because scurvy may be fatal, treatment begins immediately\\nto restore adequate vitamin C intake with daily doses of 100 to 200 mg synthetic vitamin C or orange juice in mild disease and with doses as high as 500 mg/day in severe disease. Symptoms usually subside in 2 to 3\\ndays; hemorrhages and bone disorders, in 2 to 3 weeks. Special considerations Administer ascorbic acid orally or by slow\\nI.V. infusion, as indicated. Avoid moving the patient unnecessarily to avoid irritating painful joints and muscles. Encourage him to drink orange juice. Explain the importance of supplemental ascorbic acid. Counsel the patient and his family about good dietary sources of vitamin C. Advise against taking too much vitamin C. Explain that excessive doses of ascorbic acid may cause nausea, diarrhea, and renal calculi formation and may also interfere with anticoagulant therapy. PREVENTION Patients unable or unwilling to consume foods rich in vitamin C or those facing surgery should take daily supplements of ascorbic acid. The recommended daily allowance is 60 mg/day. Vitamin C supplementation may also prevent this deficiency in\\nrecently weaned infants or those drinking formula not fortified with vitamin C. Vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D deficiency, commonly called rickets, causes failure of normal bone calcification, which occurs through several mechanisms: decreased calcium and phosphorus (the major components of bone) from the intestines, increased excretion of calcium from renal tubules, and increased parathyroid secretion resulting in increased release of calcium from the bone. The deficiency results in rickets in infants and young children and osteomalacia in adults. With treatment, the prognosis is good. However, in rickets, bone deformities usually persist, while in osteomalacia, such deformities may disappear. Causes and incidence Vitamin D deficiency results from inadequate dietary intake of preformed vitamin D, malabsorption of vitamin D, or too little\\nexposure to sunlight. Once a common childhood disease, rickets is now rare in the United States but occasionally appears in breast-fed infants who don't receive a vitamin D supplement or in infants receiving a formula with a nonfortified milk base. This deficiency may also occur in overcrowded urban areas in which smog limits sunlight penetration. Incidence is highest in black children who, because of their skin color,\\nabsorb less sunlight. (Solar ultraviolet rays irradiate 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of vitamin D, to form calciferol.) Osteomalacia, also uncommon in the United States, is most\\nprevalent in Asia, among young multiparas who eat a cereal diet and have minimal exposure to sunlight. Other causes include: vitamin D-resistant rickets (refractory rickets, familial hypophosphatemia) from an inherited impairment of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (from vitamin D insensitivity) conditions that lower absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, such as chronic pancreatitis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, gastric or small bowel resections, fistulas, colitis, and biliary obstruction hepatic or renal disease, which interferes\\nwith the formation of hydroxylated calciferol, necessary to initiate the formation of a calcium-binding protein in intestinal absorption sites malfunctioning parathyroid gland (decreased secretion of parathyroid hormone), which contributes to calcium deficiency (normally, vitamin D controls calcium and phosphorus absorption through the intestine) and interferes with activation of vitamin D in the kidneys. Complications Chronic skeletal pain Skeletal deformities Skeletal fractures Signs and symptoms Early indications of vitamin D deficiency are profuse sweating, restlessness, and irritability. Chronic deficiency induces numerous bone malformations due to softening of the bones: bowlegs, knock-knees, rachitic rosary (beading of ends of ribs), enlargement of wrists and ankles, pigeon breast, delayed closing of the fontanels, softening of the skull, and bulging of the forehead. (See Recognizing bowlegs, page 554.) Other rachitic features are poorly developed muscles (potbelly) and infantile tetany. Bone deformities may cause difficulty in walking and in climbing stairs, spontaneous multiple fractures, and lower back and leg pain. Diagnosis Physical examination, dietary history, and laboratory tests establish the diagnosis. Test results that suggest vitamin D deficiency include plasma calcium serum levels less than 7.5 mg/dl, serum inorganic phosphorus levels less than 3 mg/dl, serum citrate P levels less than 2.5 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase levels less than 4 Bodansky units/dl. RECOGNIZING BOWLEGS This infant with rickets shows characteristic bowing of the legs. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS X-rays confirm the diagnosis by showing characteristic bone deformities and abnormalities such as Looser's zones (pseudofractures). Treatment For osteomalacia and rickets\\u2014except when caused by malabsorption\\u2014 treatment consists of oral doses of vitamin D or sources such as fish, liver, and processed milk. Exposure to sunlight is encouraged. For rickets refractory to vitamin D or in rickets accompanied by hepatic or renal disease, treatment includes 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1, 25- dihydroxycholecalciferol, or a synthetic analogue of active vitamin D. Replacement of deficient calcium\\nand phosphorus also helps to eliminate most symptoms of rickets. Positioning or bracing may be used to reduce or prevent deformities; some skeletal deformities may require corrective surgery. Special considerations Obtain a dietary history to assess the patient's current vitamin D intake. Encourage him to eat foods high in vitamin D\\u2014fortified milk, fish liver oils, herring, liver, and egg yolks\\u2014and get sufficient sun exposure. If deficiency is due to socioeconomic conditions, refer the patient to appropriate community agencies. If the patient must take vitamin D for a prolonged period, tell him to watch for signs of vitamin D toxicity (headache, nausea, constipation and, after prolonged use, renal calculi). PREVENTION Administer supplementary aqueous preparations of vitamin D for chronic fat malabsorption, hydroxylated cholecalciferol for refractory rickets, and supplemental vitamin D for breast-fed infants. Consider genetic counseling for a patient with a family history of inherited disorders that can cause rickets. Vitamin E deficiency Vitamin E (tocopherol) appears to act primarily as an antioxidant, preventing intracellular oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty\\nacids and other lipids. It protects body tissue from damage caused by unstable substances called free radicals, which can harm cells, tissues,\\nand organs and are believed to be one of the causes of aging's degenerative process. Vitamin E is also important in the formation of red blood cells (RBCs) and helps the body to use vitamin K. Vitamin E deficiency usually manifests as hemolytic anemia in low-birth-weight or premature neonates. With treatment, prognosis is good. Causes and incidence P Vitamin E deficiency in infants usually results from consuming formulas high in polyunsaturated fatty acids that are fortified with iron but not vitamin E. Such formulas increase the need for antioxidant vitamin E because the iron supplement catalyzes the oxidation of RBC lipids. A neonate has low tissue concentrations of vitamin E to begin with because only a small amount passes through the placenta; the mother retains most of it. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, deficiency develops in conditions associated with fat malabsorption, such as kwashiorkor, celiac disease, or cystic fibrosis. These conditions may induce megaloblastic or hemolytic anemia and creatinuria, all of which are reversible with vitamin E administration. Vitamin E deficiency is uncommon in adults but is possible in people whose diets are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which increase vitamin E requirements, and in people with vitamin E malabsorption, which impairs RBC survival. Complication Hemolytic anemia Signs and symptoms Vitamin E deficiency is difficult to recognize, but its early symptoms include edema and skin lesions in infants and muscle weakness or intermittent claudication in adults. In premature neonates, vitamin E deficiency produces hemolytic anemia, thrombocythemia, and erythematous papular skin eruption, followed by desquamation. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Dietary and medical histories suggest vitamin E deficiency. Serum alphatocopherol levels below 0.5 mg/dl in adults and below 0.2 mg/dl in infants confirm it. Creatinuria, increased creatine kinase levels, hemolytic anemia, and an elevated platelet count generally support the diagnosis. Treatment Replacement of vitamin E with a water-soluble supplement, either oral or parenteral, is the only appropriate treatment. Special considerations As indicated, prevent deficiency by providing vitamin E supplements for low-birth-weight neonates receiving formulas not fortified with vitamin E and for adults with vitamin E malabsorption. Many commercial multivitamin supplements are easily absorbed by patients with vitamin E malabsorption. If vitamin E deficiency is related to socioeconomic conditions, refer the patient to appropriate community agencies. PREVENTION Inform new mothers who plan to breast-feed that human milk provides adequate vitamin E. Encourage adult patients to eat foods high in vitamin E; good sources include vegetable oils (corn, safflower, soybean, cottonseed); whole grains; dark green, leafy vegetables; nuts; and legumes. Tell them that heavy consumption of\\npolyunsaturated fatty acids increases the need for vitamin E. Vitamin K deficiency Deficiency of vitamin K, an element necessary for formation of prothrombin and other clotting factors in the liver, produces abnormal bleeding. If the deficiency is corrected, the prognosis is excellent. Causes and incidence P Vitamin K deficiency is common among neonates in the first few days postpartum due to poor placental transfer of vitamin K and inadequate production of vitamin Kproducing intestinal flora. Its other causes include prolonged use of drugs, such as the anticoagulant warfarin and antibiotics that destroy normal intestinal bacteria; decreased flow of bile to the small intestine from obstruction of the bile duct or bile fistula; malabsorption of vitamin K due to sprue, pellagra, bowel resection, ileitis, or ulcerative colitis; chronic hepatic disease, with impaired response of hepatic ribosomes to vitamin K; and cystic fibrosis, with fat malabsorption. Vitamin K deficiency seldom results from insufficient dietary intake of this vitamin. Signs and symptoms The cardinal sign of vitamin K deficiency is an abnormal bleeding tendency, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time (PT); these\\nsigns disappear with vitamin K administration. Without treatment, bleeding may be severe and, possibly, fatal. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A PT that's 25% longer than the normal range of 10 to 20 seconds, measured by the Quick method, confirms the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency after other causes of prolonged PT (such as anticoagulant therapy or hepatic disease) have been ruled out. The international normalized ratio (normal value, 0.8 to 1.2) is the more common method of assessing PT adequacy. Repetition of testing in 24 hours (and regularly during treatment) monitors the therapy's effectiveness. Treatment Administration of vitamin K I.V. or I.M. corrects abnormal bleeding tendencies. Special considerations PREVENTION Administer vitamin K to neonates and patients with fat malabsorption or with prolonged diarrhea from colitis, ileitis, or long-term antibiotic drug therapy. If the deficiency has\\na dietary cause, help the patient and his family plan a diet that includes important sources of vitamin K, such as cauliflower, tomatoes, cheese, egg yolks, liver, and green, leafy vegetables. Warn against self-medication with or overuse of antibiotics, because these drugs destroy the intestinal bacteria needed to generate significant amounts of vitamin K. Hypervitaminoses A and D Hypervitaminosis A is excessive accumulation of vitamin A; hypervitaminosis D, of vitamin D. Although these are toxic conditions, they usually respond well to treatment. They're most prevalent in infants and children, usually as a result of accidental or misguided overdosage by parents. A related, benign condition called hypercarotenemia results from excessive consumption of carotene, a chemical precursor of vitamin A. Causes and incidence Vitamins A and D are fat-soluble vitamins that accumulate\\nin the body because they aren't dissolved and excreted in the urine. (See Important facts about vitamins A and D .)\\nIn most cases, hypervitaminoses A and D result from ingestion of excessive amounts of supplemental vitamin preparations. A single dose of\\nmore than 1 million units of vitamin A can cause acute toxicity; daily doses of 15,000 to 25,000 units taken over weeks or months have proven toxic in infants and children. For the same dose to produce toxicity in adults, ingestion over years is necessary. Doses of 100,000 international units of vitamin D daily for several P months can cause toxicity in adults. Individuals who are at risk include those with hyperparathyroidism, kidney disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or histoplasmosis. PEDIATRIC TIP In infants, giving 40,000 international units daily of vitamin D can cause toxicity in 1 to 4 months. Hypervitaminosis A may occur in patients receiving pharmacologic doses of vitamin A for dermatologic disorders. Hypervitaminosis D may occur in patients receiving high doses of the vitamin as treatment for hypoparathyroidism, rickets, and the osteodystrophy of chronic renal failure, and in infants who consume fortified milk and cereals plus a vitamin supplement. Concentrations of vitamin A in common foods are generally too low to pose a danger of excessive intake. However, a benign condition called hypercarotenemia results from excessive consumption of vegetables high in carotene (a protovitamin that the body converts into vitamin A), such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and dark green, leafy vegetables. Signs and symptoms Chronic hypervitaminosis A produces anorexia, irritability, headache, hair loss, malaise, itching, vertigo, bone pain,\\nbone fragility, and dry, peeling skin. It may also cause hepatosplenomegaly and emotional lability. Acute toxicity may also produce transient hydrocephalus and vomiting. (Hypercarotenemia produces\\nyellow or orange skin coloration.) Hypervitaminosis D causes anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia. Because vitamin D promotes calcium absorption, severe toxicity can lead to hypercalcemia, including calcification of soft tissues, as in the heart, aorta, and renal tubules. Lethargy, confusion, and coma may accompany severe hypercalcemia. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT VITAMINS A AND D This table illustrates good sources of vitamins A and D, their recommended daily allowances, and the actions they produce. Vitamin Sources Recommended dietary allowance Action Vitamin A \\u25aa Carrots; sweet potatoes; dark green, leafy vegetables; butter; margarine; liver; egg yolk \\u25aa Children: 1,400 international units \\u25aa Adults: 4,000 to 5,000 international units \\u25aa Lactating women: 6,000 international units \\u25aa Produces retinal pigment and maintains epithelial tissue Vitamin D \\u25aa Ultraviolet light; fortified foods (especially milk) \\u25aa 400 international units daily \\u25aa Promotes absorption and regulates metabolism of calcium and phosphorus Diagnosis A thorough patient history suggests hypervitaminosis A. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum vitamin A level (over 90 mcg/dl) confirms hypervitaminosis A. Patient history and an elevated serum calcium level (over 10.5 mcg/dl) suggest hypervitaminosis D. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum vitamin D level confirms hypervitaminosis D. In children, X-rays showing calcification of tendons, ligaments, and subperiosteal tissues support this diagnosis. P CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum carotene level (over 250 mcg/dl) confirms hypercarotenemia. Treatment Withholding vitamin supplements usually corrects hypervitaminosis A quickly and hypervitaminosis D gradually. Hypercalcemia may persist for weeks or months after the patient stops taking vitamin D. Treatment for severe hypervitaminosis D may include glucocorticoids to control hypercalcemia and prevent renal damage. In the acute stage, diuretics or other emergency measures for severe hypercalcemia may be necessary. Hypercarotenemia responds well to a diet\\nfree of high- carotene foods. Special considerations Keep the patient comfortable, and reassure him that symptoms will subside after he stops taking the vitamin. Make sure the patient or the parents of a child with these conditions understand that vitamins aren't innocuous. Explain the hazards associated with excessive vitamin intake. Point out that vitamin A and D requirements can easily be met with a diet containing dark green, leafy vegetables; fruits; and fortified milk or milk products. PREVENTION Monitor serum vitamin A levels in patients receiving doses above the recommended daily allowance and serum\\ncalcium levels in patients receiving pharmacologic doses of vitamin D. Iodine deficiency Iodine deficiency is the absence of sufficient levels of iodine to satisfy daily metabolic requirements. Because the thyroid gland uses most of the body's iodine stores, iodine deficiency is apt to cause hypothyroidism and thyroid gland hypertrophy (endemic goiter). Other effects of deficiency range from dental caries to cretinism in neonates born to iodine-deficient mothers. Iodine deficiency is most common in pregnant or lactating women due to their exaggerated metabolic need for this element. Iodine deficiency responds readily to treatment with iodine supplements. Causes and incidence Iodine deficiency usually results from insufficient intake of dietary sources of iodine, such as iodized table salt, seafood, and dark green, leafy vegetables. (Normal iodine requirements range from 35 mcg/ day for infants to 150 mcg/day for lactating women; the average adult needs 1 mcg/kg of body weight.) Iodine deficiency may also result from an increase in metabolic demands during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence. Complications Hypothyroidism Goiter Signs and symptoms Clinical features of iodine deficiency depend on the degree of hypothyroidism that develops (in addition to the development of a goiter). Mild deficiency may produce only mild, nonspecific symptoms, such as lassitude, fatigue, and loss of motivation. Severe deficiency usually generates the typically overt and unmistakable features of hypothyroidism: bradycardia; decreased pulse pressure and cardiac output; weakness; hoarseness; dry, flaky, inelastic skin; puffy face; thick tongue; delayed relaxation phase in deep tendon reflexes; poor memory; hearing loss; chills; anorexia; and nystagmus. In women, iodine deficiency may also cause menorrhagia and amenorrhea. Cretinism\\u2014hypothyroidism that develops in utero or in early infancy\\u2014is characterized by failure to thrive, neonatal jaundice, and hypothermia. By age 3 to 6 months, the infant may display spastic diplegia and signs and symptoms similar to those seen in infants with Down syndrome. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Abnormal laboratory test results include low thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with high radioactive iodine ( 131 I) uptake, low 24-hour urine iodine levels, and high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Radioiodine uptake test traces 131 I in the thyroid 24 hours after administration; triiodothyronine- resin or T 4 -resin uptake test shows values 25% below normal. Treatment Severe iodine deficiency requires administration of iodine supplements (potassium iodide [SSKI]). Mild deficiency may be corrected by increasing iodine intake through the use of iodized table salt and consumption of iodine-rich foods (seafood and green, leafy vegetables). Special considerations Administer SSKI preparation in milk or juice to reduce gastric irritation and mask its metallic taste. To prevent tooth discoloration, tell the patient to drink the solution through a straw. Store the solution in a light-resistant container. PREVENTION Recommend the use of iodized salt and consumption of iodine-rich foods for high-risk patients\\u2014especially adolescents and pregnant or lactating women. Advise pregnant women\\nthat severe iodine deficiency may produce cretinism in neonates, and instruct them to watch for early signs of iodine deficiency, such as P fatigue, lassitude, weakness, and decreased mental function. Zinc deficiency Zinc, an essential trace element that's present in the bones, teeth, hair, skin, testes, liver, and muscles, is also a vital component of many enzymes. Zinc promotes synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid and, ultimately, protein, and maintains normal blood concentrations of vitamin A by mobilizing it from the liver. The prognosis is good with correction of the deficiency. Causes and incidence Zinc deficiency usually results from excessive intake of foods (containing iron, calcium, vitamin D, and the fiber and phytates in cereals) that bind zinc to form insoluble chelates that prevent its absorption. Occasionally, it results from blood loss due to parasitism and low intake of foods containing zinc. Alcohol and corticosteroids increase renal excretion of zinc. Zinc deficiency is most common in people from underdeveloped countries, especially in the Middle East. Children are most susceptible to this deficiency during periods of rapid growth. Signs and symptoms Zinc deficiency produces hepatosplenomegaly, sparse hair growth, soft and misshapen nails, poor wound healing, anorexia, hypogeusesthesia (decreased taste acuity), dysgeusia (unpleasant taste),\\nhyposmia (decreased odor acuity), dysosmia (unpleasant odor in nasopharynx), severe iron deficiency anemia, bone deformities and, when chronic, hypogonadism, dwarfism, and hyperpigmentation. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Fasting serum zinc levels below 70 mcg/ dl confirm zinc deficiency and indicate altered phosphate metabolism, imbalance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and decreased pancreatic enzyme levels. Treatment Treatment consists of correcting the deficiency's underlying cause and administering zinc supplements, as necessary. Special considerations Advise the patient to take zinc supplements with milk or meals to prevent gastric distress and vomiting. PREVENTION Encourage a balanced diet that includes seafood, oatmeal, bran, meat, eggs, nuts, and dry yeast and the correct use of calcium and iron supplements. Obesity Obesity is an excess of body fat, generally 20% above ideal body weight. The prognosis for correction of obesity is poor: Fewer than 30% of patients succeed in losing 20 lb (9 kg), and only half\\nof these maintain the loss over a prolonged period. Causes and incidence Obesity results from excessive calorie intake and inadequate expenditure of energy. Theories to explain this condition include hypothalamic dysfunction of hunger and satiety centers, genetic predisposition, abnormal absorption of nutrients, and impaired action of GI and growth hormones and of hormonal regulators such as insulin. An inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the prevalence of obesity has been documented, especially in women. Obesity in parents increases the probability of obesity in children, from genetic or environmental factors, such as activity levels and learned patterns of P eating. Psychological factors, such as stress or emotional eating, may also contribute to obesity. Rates of obesity are climbing, and the percentage of children and adolescents who are obese has doubled in the last 20 years. Complications Respiratory difficulties Hypertension Cardiovascular disease Diabetes mellitus Renal disease Gallbladder disease Psychosocial difficulties Premature death Diagnosis Observation and comparison of height and weight to a standard table indicate obesity. Measurement of the thickness of subcutaneous fat folds with calipers provides an approximation of total body fat. Although this measurement is reliable and isn't subject to daily fluctuations, it has little meaning for the patient in monitoring subsequent weight loss. Treatment Successful management of obesity must decrease the patient's daily calorie intake while increasing his activity level. Effective treatment must be based on a balanced, low-calorie diet that eliminates foods high in fat or sugar. Lifelong maintenance of these improved eating and exercise patterns is necessary to achieve long-term benefits. The popular low-carbohydrate diets offer no long-term advantage; rapid early weight reduction is due to loss of water, not fat. These and other crash or fad diets have the overwhelming drawback that they don't teach the patient long-term modification of eating patterns and often lead to the \\u201cyo-yo syndrome\\u201d\\u2014episodes of repeated weight loss followed by weight gain. This can be more detrimental than the obesity itself because of the severe stress it can place on the body. Total fasting is an effective method of rapid weight reduction but requires close monitoring and supervision to minimize risks of ketonemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, and loss of lean\\nbody mass. Prolonged fasting and very-low-calorie diets have been associated with sudden death, possibly resulting from cardiac arrhythmias caused by electrolyte abnormalities. These methods also neglect patient re- education, which is necessary for long-term weight maintenance. Treatment may also include hypnosis and behavior modification techniques, which promote fundamental changes in eating habits and activity patterns. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial for some patients, because weight reduction may lead to depression or even psychosis. Antidepressants are also helpful in weight\\nloss. Amphetamines and amphetamine congeners have been used to enhance compliance with a prescribed diet by temporarily suppressing the appetite and creating a feeling of well-being. However, because their value in long-term weight control is questionable, and they have significant potential for dependence and abuse, their use is generally avoided. If these drugs are used at all, they should be prescribed only for short-term therapy and should be monitored carefully. As a last resort, morbid obesity, which is indicated by body weight that's 50% to 100% higher than ideal, body weight that's 100\\npounds higher than ideal, or a body mass index greater than 39, may be treated surgically with a variety of restrictive procedures. The two most popular bariatric surgeries are vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass surgery. These procedures decrease the volume of food that the stomach can hold or bypass the stomach, with the goal of producing satiety with small intake. Bypassing the stomach also induces diarrhea when concentrated sweets are ingested. These techniques cause fewer complications than jejunoileal bypass, which induces a permanent malabsorption syndrome. Extended liquid diets are necessary adjuncts to surgery. Psychological counseling is also recommended. Special considerations P Obtain an accurate diet history to identify the patient's eating patterns and the importance of food to his\\nlifestyle. Ask the patient to keep a careful record of what, where, and\\nwhen he eats to help identify situations that normally provoke overeating. Explain the prescribed diet carefully, and encourage compliance to improve health status. To increase calorie expenditure, promote increased physical activity, including an exercise program. Recommend varying activity levels according to the patient's general condition and\\ncardiovascular status. Watch carefully for signs of dependence or\\nabuse if the patient is taking appetitesuppressing drugs; also watch for adverse effects, such as insomnia, excitability, dry mouth, and GI disturbances. Teach the grossly obese patient the importance of good skin care to prevent breakdown in moist skin folds. Recommend the regular use of powder to keep skin dry. The patient having gastric bypass surgery should receive psychological and nutritional counseling before and after\\nthe surgery to assist with dietary and lifestyle changes. PREVENTION Teach parents to avoid overfeeding their infants and to familiarize themselves with actual nutritional needs and optimum growth rates. Discourage parents from using food to reward or console their children, from emphasizing the importance of \\u201cclean plates,\\u201d and from allowing eating to prevent hunger rather than to satisfy it. Encourage physical activity and exercise, especially in children and young adults, to establish lifelong patterns. Suggest low-calorie snacks such as raw vegetables. Protein-calorie malnutrition One of the most prevalent and serious depletion disorders, protein- calorie malnutrition (PCM) occurs as marasmus (protein-calorie deficiency), characterized by growth failure and wasting, and as kwashiorkor (protein deficiency), characterized by tissue edema and damage. Both forms vary from mild to severe and may be fatal, depending on the accompanying stress (particularly sepsis or injury) and duration of deprivation. PCM increases the risk of death from pneumonia, chickenpox, or measles. Causes and incidence Both kwashiorkor (edematous PCM) and marasmus (nonedematous PCM) are common in underdeveloped countries and in areas in which dietary amino acid content is insufficient to satisfy growth requirements. Kwashiorkor typically occurs at about age 1, after infants\\nare weaned from breast milk to a protein-deficient diet of starchy gruels or sugar water, but it can develop at any time during the formative years. Marasmus affects infants ages 6 to 18 months as a result of breast- feeding failure, or a debilitating condition such as chronic diarrhea. In industrialized countries, PCM may occur secondary to chronic metabolic disease that decreases protein and calorie intake or absorption, or trauma that increases protein and calorie requirements. ELDER TIP In the United States, PCM is estimated to occur to some extent in 50% of elderly people in nursing homes. Those who aren't allowed anything by mouth for an extended period are at high risk of developing PCM. Conditions that increase protein-calorie requirements include severe burns and injuries,\\nsystemic infections, and cancer (accounts for the largest group of hospitalized patients with PCM). Conditions that cause defective utilization of nutrients include malabsorption syndrome, short-bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. Signs and symptoms Children with chronic PCM are small for their chronological age and tend to be physically inactive, mentally apathetic, and susceptible to frequent infections. Anorexia and diarrhea\\nare common. P In acute PCM, children are small, gaunt, and emaciated, with no adipose tissue. Skin is dry and \\u201cbaggy,\\u201d and hair is sparse and dull brown or reddish-yellow. Temperature is low; pulse rate and respirations are slowed. Such children are weak, irritable, and usually hungry, although they may have anorexia, with nausea and vomiting. Unlike marasmus, chronic kwashiorkor allows the patient to grow in height, but adipose tissue diminishes as fat metabolizes to meet energy demands. Edema often masks severe muscle wasting; dry, peeling skin and hepatomegaly are common. Patients with secondary PCM show signs similar to marasmus, primarily loss of adipose tissue and lean body mass, lethargy, and edema. Severe secondary PCM may cause loss\\nof immunocompetence. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Clinical appearance, dietary history, and anthropometry confirm PCM. If the patient doesn't suffer from fluid retention, weight change over time is the best index of nutritional status. The following factors support the diagnosis: height and weight less than 80% of standard for the patient's age and sex, and below-normal arm circumference and triceps skinfold serum albumin level less than 2.8 g/dl (normal: 3.3 to 4.3 g/dl) urinary creatinine (24-hour) level used to\\nshow lean body mass status by relating creatinine excretion to height and ideal body weight, to yield creatinine-height index. Treatment The aim of treatment is to provide sufficient proteins, calories, and other nutrients for nutritional rehabilitation and maintenance. When treating severe PCM, restoring fluid and electrolyte balance parentally is the initial concern. A patient who shows normal absorption may receive enteral nutrition after anorexia has subsided. When possible, the preferred treatment is oral feeding. Foods are introduced slowly. Carbohydrates are given first to supply energy, and then high-quality protein foods, especially milk, and protein-calorie supplements, are given. A patient who's unwilling or unable to eat may require supplementary feedings through a nasogastric tube or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which is given through a central venous catheter because of its higher osmolality. Peripheral parenteral nutrition, which has a lower osmolality than TPN and can be given through a peripheral I.V. line, is an alternative to TPN, but it's given\\nless commonly. Accompanying infection must also be treated, preferably with antibiotics that don't inhibit protein synthesis. Cautious realimentation is essential to prevent complications from overloading the compromised metabolic system. Special considerations Encourage the patient with PCM to consume as much nutritious food and beverage as possible. (It's often helpful to\\n\\u201ccheer him on\\u201d as he eats.) Assist the patient with eating if necessary. Cooperate closely with the dietitian to monitor intake, and provide acceptable meals and snacks. If TPN is necessary, observe strict sterile technique when handling catheters, tubes, and solutions and during dressing changes. PREVENTION Watch for PCM in patients who have been hospitalized for a prolonged period, have had no oral intake for several days, or have cachectic disease. To help eradicate PCM\\nin developing countries, encourage prolonged breast-feeding, educate mothers about their children's needs, and provide supplementary foods, as needed. ELDER TIP P If the older patient is anorectic, consider asking family members and other visitors to bring in special foods from home that may improve the patient's appetite. In addition, encouraging the family to collaborate on feeding a dependent patient can\\nhelp promote his recovery, enhance his feelings of well-being, and stimulate him to eat more. METABOLIC DISORDERS Galactosemia Galactosemia is any disorder of galactose metabolism. It produces symptoms ranging from cataracts and liver damage to mental retardation and occurs in two forms: classic galactosemia and galactokinase-deficiency galactosemia. Although a galactose-free diet relieves most symptoms, galactosemia-induced mental impairment is irreversible; some residual vision impairment may also persist. Causes and incidence Both forms of galactosemia are inherited as autosomal recessive defects and occur in about 1 in 60,000 births in the United States. Up to 1.25% of the population is heterozygous for the classic galactosemia gene. Classic galactosemia results from a defect in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase. (See Metabolic pathway in galactosemia .) Galactokinasedeficiency galactosemia, the rarer form of this disorder, stems from a deficiency of the enzyme galactokinase. In both forms of galactosemia, the inability to normally metabolize the sugar galactose (which is mainly formed by digestion of the disaccharide lactose that's present in milk) causes galactose accumulation. Complications Ovarian dysfunction Cataracts Abnormal speech Cognitive impairment Motor delay Growth retardation Signs and symptoms In children who are homozygous for the classic galactosemia gene, signs are evident at birth or begin within a few days\\nafter milk ingestion, and include failure to thrive, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other clinical effects include liver damage (which causes jaundice, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, and ascites), splenomegaly, galactosuria, proteinuria, and aminoaciduria. Cataracts may also be present at birth or develop later. Pseudotumor cerebri may occur. Continued ingestion of galactose- or lactose-containing foods may cause mental retardation, malnourishment, progressive hepatic failure, and death\\u2014from the stillunknown process of galactose metabolites accumulating in body tissues. Although treatment may prevent\\nmental impairment, galactosemia can produce a short attention span, difficulty with spatial and mathematical relationships, and apathetic, withdrawn behavior. Cataracts may be the only sign of galactokinase deficiency, resulting from the accumulation of galactitol, a metabolic by-product of galactose, in the lens. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase in red blood cells (RBCs) confirms classic galactosemia; decreased RBC levels of galactokinase confirm galactokinase deficiency. Prenatal diagnosis may be made by direct measurement of galactose-1- phosphate uridyl transferase. Related laboratory results include increased galactose levels in blood (normal value in children is less than 20 mg/dl) and urine (must use galactose oxidase to avoid confusion with other reducing\\nsugars). Galactose measurements in blood and urine must be interpreted carefully because some children who consume large amounts of milk have elevated plasma galactose concentrations and galactosuria but aren't galactosemic. Also, neonates excrete galactose in their urine for about a\\nweek after birth; premature infants, even longer. METABOLIC PATHWAY IN GALACTOSEMIA Other test results include: P DIET FOR GALACTOSEMIA A patient with galactosemia must follow a lactose-free diet. It's important for him to carefully read food labels to avoid milk\\nand milk products, including dry milk products. He may eat these foods: fish and animal products (except brains and mussels) fresh fruits and vegetables (except peas and lima beans) only bread and rolls made from cracked wheat. He should avoid these foods: dairy products puddings, cookies, cakes, pies food coloring instant potatoes canned and frozen foods (if lactose is listed as an ingredient). liver biopsy\\u2014typical acinar formation liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase levels)\\u2014elevated urinalysis\\u2014albumin in urine ophthalmoscopy\\u2014punctate lesions in the fetal lens nucleus (with treatment, cataracts regress) amniocentesis\\u2014prenatal diagnosis of galactosemia (recommended for heterozygous and homozygous parents). Treatment Elimination of galactose and lactose from the diet causes\\nmost effects to subside. The infant is fed soy formula, meat-base formula, protein hydrolysate formula, or another lactose-free formula. The infant gains weight; liver anomalies, nausea, vomiting, galactosemia, proteinuria, and aminoaciduria disappear; and cataracts regress. As the child grows, a balanced, galactose-free diet must be maintained. A pregnant woman who's heterozygous or homozygous for galactosemia should also follow a galactose-restricted diet. Such a diet\\nsupports normal growth and development and may delay symptoms in the neonate. Special considerations To eliminate galactose and lactose from an\\ninfant's diet, replace cow's milk formula or breast milk with a meat-base or soybean formula. Teach the parents about dietary restrictions and stress the importance of compliance. (See Diet for galactosemia .) Warn them to read medication labels carefully and avoid giving any medication that contains lactose fillers. If the child has a learning disability, help parents secure educational assistance. Refer parents who want to have other children for genetic counseling. In some states, screening of\\nall neonates for galactosemia is required by law. Instruct the parents to contact support groups, such as Parents of Galactosemic Children, for further information and support if appropriate. Glycogen storage diseases Glycogen storage diseases consist of at least eight distinct errors of metabolism, all inherited, that alter the synthesis or degradation of glycogen, the form in which glucose is stored in the body. Normally, muscle and liver cells store glycogen. Muscle glycogen is used in muscle contraction; liver glycogen can be converted into free\\nglucose, which can then diffuse out of the liver cells to increase blood glucose levels. Glycogen storage diseases manifest as dysfunctions\\nof the liver, heart, or musculoskeletal system. Symptoms vary from mild\\nand easily controlled hypoglycemia to severe organ involvement that may\\nlead to heart failure and respiratory failure. Causes and incidence P Almost all glycogen storage diseases (Types I through V and Type VII) are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits. The transmission mode of Type VI is unknown; Type VIII may be an X-linked trait. The most common glycogen storage disease is Type I\\u2014von Gierke's, or hepatorenal glycogen storage disease\\u2014which results from a deficiency of the liver enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. This enzyme converts glucose- 6-phosphate into free glucose and is necessary for the release of stored glycogen and glucose into the bloodstream, to relieve hypoglycemia. Infants may die of acidosis before age 2; if they survive past this age, with proper treatment, they\\nmay grow normally and live to adulthood, with only minimal hepatomegaly. However, there's a danger of adenomatous liver nodules, which may be premalignant. Complications Heat intolerance Easy bruising Slowed growth Incomplete sexual development Hepatic ademonas Multiple organ failure Signs and symptoms Primary clinical features of the liver glycogen storage diseases (Types I, III, IV, VI, and VIII) are hepatomegaly and rapid onset of hypoglycemia and ketosis when food is withheld. Symptoms of the\\nmuscle glycogen storage diseases (Types II, V, and VII) include poor muscle tone; Type II may result in death from heart failure. (See Rare forms of glycogen storage disease, pages 566 and 567.) In addition, Type I may produce these symptoms: infants\\u2014acidosis, hyperlipidemia, GI bleeding, coma children\\u2014low resistance to infection and, without proper treatment, short stature adolescents\\u2014gouty arthritis and nephropathy; chronic tophaceous gout; bleeding (especially epistaxis); small superficial vessels visible in skin due to impaired platelet function; fat deposits in cheeks, buttocks, and subcutaneous tissues; poor muscle tone; enlarged kidneys; xanthomas over extensor surfaces of arms and legs; steatorrhea; multiple, bilateral, yellow lesions in fundi; and osteoporosis, probably secondary to negative calcium balance.\\nCorrect treatment of glycogen storage disease should prevent all of these effects. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Liver biopsy confirms the diagnosis by showing normal glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase enzyme activities but reduced or absent glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Glycogen structure is normal but amounts are elevated. Spectroscopy may be used to show abnormal muscle metabolism with the use of magnetic resonance imaging in specialized centers. Laboratory studies of plasma demonstrate low glucose levels but high levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and uric acid. Serum analysis reveals high pyruvic acid levels and high lactic acid levels. Prenatal diagnoses are available for\\nTypes II, III, and IV. Injection of glucagon or epinephrine increases pyruvic and lactic acid levels but doesn't increase blood glucose levels. Glucose tolerance test curve typically shows depletional\\nhypoglycemia and reduced insulin output. Intrauterine diagnosis is possible. Treatment For Type I, treatment aims to maintain glucose homeostasis and prevent secondary consequences of hypoglycemia through frequent feedings and constant nocturnal nasogastric (NG) drip with Polycose, dextrose, or P Vivonex. Treatment includes a low-fat diet, with normal amounts of protein and calories; carbohydrates should contain glucose or glucose polymers only. Therapy for Type III includes frequent feedings and a high-protein diet. Type IV requires a high-protein, high-calorie diet; bed rest; diuretics; sodium restriction; and paracentesis, if necessary,\\nto relieve ascites. Types V and VII require no treatment except avoidance of strenuous exercise. No treatment is necessary for Types VI and VIII; no effective treatment exists for Type II. Special considerations When managing Type I disease: Advise the patient or his parents to include carbohydrate foods containing mainly starch in his diet and to sweeten foods with glucose only. Before discharge, teach the patient or his\\nfamily member how to pass an NG tube, use a pump with alarm capacity, monitor blood glucose levels with glucose reagent strips, and recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia.

When managing other types, do the following. Type II: Explain test procedures, such as electromyography and EEG, thoroughly. P Type III: Instruct the patient to eat a high-protein diet (eggs, nuts, fish, meat, poultry, and cheese). Type IV: Watch\\nfor signs of hepatic failure (nausea, vomiting, irregular bowel function, clay-colored stools, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, edema, and changes in mental status,\\nprogressing to coma). When caring for patients with Types II, III, and IV glycogen storage disease, offer the patient and his parents reassurance and emotional support. Recommend and arrange for genetic counseling, if appropriate. Types V through VIII: Care for these patients is minimal. Explain the disorder to the patient\\nand his family, and help them accept the limitations imposed by his particular type of glycogen storage disease. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is an abnormally low glucose level in the bloodstream. It occurs when glucose burns up too rapidly, when the glucose release rate falls behind tissue demands, or when excessive insulin enters the bloodstream. Hypoglycemia is classified as reactive or fasting. Reactive hypoglycemia results from the reaction to the disposition of meals or the administration of excessive insulin. Fasting hypoglycemia causes discomfort during long periods of abstinence from food, for example, in the early morning before breakfast. Although hypoglycemia is\\na specific endocrine imbalance, its symptoms are often vague and depend\\non how quickly the patient's glucose levels drop. If not corrected, severe hypoglycemia may result in coma and irreversible brain damage. Causes and incidence Reactive hypoglycemia may take several forms. In a diabetic patient, it may result from administration of too much insulin or, less commonly, too much oral antidiabetic medication. In a mildly diabetic patient (or one in the early stages of diabetes mellitus), reactive hypoglycemia may result from delayed and excessive insulin production after carbohydrate ingestion. Similarly, a nondiabetic patient may develop reactive hypoglycemia from a sharp increase in insulin output after a meal. Sometimes called postprandial hypoglycemia, this type of reactive hypoglycemia usually disappears when the patient eats something sweet. In some patients, reactive hypoglycemia has no known cause (idiopathic reactive) or may result from gastric dumping syndrome and from impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting hypoglycemia usually results from an excess of insulin or insulin- like substance or from a decrease in counterregulatory hormones. It can be exogenous, resulting from such external factors as alcohol or drug ingestion, or endogenous, resulting from organic problems. Endogenous hypoglycemia may result from tumors or liver disease. Insulinomas, small islet cell tumors in the pancreas, secrete excessive amounts of insulin, which inhibit hepatic glucose production. They're generally benign (in 90% of patients). Extrapancreatic tumors, though uncommon, can also cause hypoglycemia by increasing glucose utilization and inhibiting glucose output. Such tumors occur primarily in the mesenchyma, liver, adrenal cortex, GI system, and lymphatic system. They may be benign or malignant. Among nonendo-crine causes of fasting hypoglycemia are severe liver diseases, including hepatitis, cancer, cirrhosis, and liver congestion associated with heart failure. All of these conditions reduce the uptake and release of glycogen from the liver. Some endocrine causes include adrenocortical insufficiency, which contributes to hypoglycemia by reducing the production of cortisol\\nand cortisone needed for gluconeogenesis; and pituitary insufficiency, which reduces corticotropin and growth hormone levels. Hypoglycemia is at least as common in neonates and children as it is in adults and affects 1 out of 1,000 people. Usually, infants develop hypoglycemia because of an increased number of cells per\\nunit of body weight and because of increased demands on stored liver glycogen to support respirations, thermoregulation, and muscular activity. In full- term neonates, hypoglycemia may occur 24 to 72 hours after birth and is usually transient. In neonates who are premature or small for gestational age, onset of hypoglycemia is much more rapid (it can occur as soon as 6 hours after birth) because of their small, immature livers, which produce much less glycogen. Maternal disorders that can produce hypoglycemia in neonates within 24 hours after birth include diabetes mellitus, toxemia, erythroblastosis, and glycogen storage disease. Complication Permanent brain damage Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia include fatigue, malaise, nervousness, irritability, trembling, tension, headache, hunger, cold sweats, and rapid heart rate. These same clinical\\neffects usually characterize fasting hypoglycemia. In addition, fasting\\nhypoglycemia may also cause central nervous system (CNS) disturbances; for example, blurry or double vision, confusion, motor weakness, hemiplegia, seizures, or coma. In infants and children, signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are vague. A neonate's refusal to feed may be the primary clue to underlying hypoglycemia. Associated CNS effects include tremors,\\ntwitching, weak or high-pitched cry, sweating, limpness, seizures, and coma. Diagnosis A blood glucose monitor or glucose reagent strips provide\\nquick screening methods for determining the blood glucose level. A reading less than 50 mg/dl indicates the need for a venous blood sample.\\n(See Diagnosing hypoglycemia. ) CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Laboratory testing confirms the diagnosis by showing decreased blood glucose levels. The following values indicate hypoglycemia: Full-term infants \\u2013 less than 30 mg/dl before feeding \\u2013 less than 40 mg/dl after feeding Preterm infants \\u2013 less than 20 mg/dl before feeding \\u2013 less than 30 mg/dl after feeding P DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPOGLYCEMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist with treatment of the patient with hypoglycemia. P Children and adults \\u2013 less than 40 mg/dl before meal \\u2013 less than 50 mg/dl after meal. In addition, a 5-hour glucose tolerance test may be administered to provoke reactive hypoglycemia. Following a 12-hour fast,\\nlaboratory testing to detect plasma insulin and plasma glucose levels may identify fasting hypoglycemia. Treatment Effective treatment of reactive hypoglycemia requires dietary modification to help delay glucose absorption and gastric emptying. Usually this includes small, frequent meals; ingestion of complex carbohydrates, fiber, and fat; and avoidance of simple sugars, alcohol, and fruit drinks. The patient may also receive anticholinergic drugs to slow gastric emptying and intestinal motility and to inhibit vagal stimulation of insulin release. For fasting hypoglycemia, surgery and drug therapy are usually required. In patients with insulinoma, tumor removal is the treatment of choice. Drug therapy may include nondiuretic thiazides such\\nas diazoxide to inhibit insulin secretion; streptozocin; and hormones, such as glucocorticoids and long-acting glycogen. Therapy for neonates who have hypoglycemia or who are at risk of developing it includes preventive measures. A hypertonic solution of 10% dextrose, calculated at 5 to 10 ml/kg of body weight administered I.V. over 10 minutes and followed by 4 to 8 mg/ kg/minute for maintenance, should correct a severe hypoglycemic state in neonates.\\nTo reduce the chance of hypoglycemia in high-risk neonates, they should\\nreceive feedings (either breast milk or a solution of 5% to 10% glucose\\nand water) as soon after birth as possible. Special considerations Watch for and report signs of hypoglycemia, such as poor feeding, in high-risk neonates. Monitor infusion of hypertonic glucose in the neonate to avoid hyperglycemia, circulatory overload, and cellular dehydration. Terminate glucose solutions gradually to prevent hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinemia. Explain the purpose and procedure for any diagnostic tests. Collect blood samples at the appropriate times, as ordered. Monitor the effects of drug therapy and watch for the development of any adverse effects. Teach the patient or his family which foods to include in his diet (complex carbohydrates, fiber, fat) and which foods to avoid (simple sugars, alcohol). Refer the patient and his\\nfamily for dietary counseling as appropriate. Hereditary fructose intolerance Hereditary fructose intolerance is an inability to metabolize fructose. After fructose is eliminated from the diet, symptoms subside within weeks. Older children and adults with hereditary\\nfructose intolerance have normal intelligence and apparently normal liver and kidney function. Causes and incidence Transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, hereditary fructose intolerance results from a deficiency in the enzyme fructose-1- phosphate aldolase. The enzyme operates at only 1% to 10% of its normal biological activity, thus preventing rapid uptake of fructose\\nby the liver after ingestion of fruit or foods containing cane sugar. In some European countries, hereditary fructose intolerance may have an incidence as high as 1 in 20,000 people. Signs and symptoms Typically, clinical features of hereditary fructose intolerance appear shortly after dietary introduction of foods containing fructose or sucrose. Symptoms are more severe in infants than\\nin older people and include hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, pallor, excessive sweating, P cyanosis, and tremor. In neonates and young children, continuous ingestion of foods containing fructose may result in failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, hepatomegaly, vomiting, dehydration, hypophosphatemia, albuminuria, aminoaciduria, seizures, coma, febrile episodes, substernal\\npain, and anemia. Diagnosis A dietary history often suggests hereditary fructose intolerance. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A fructose tolerance test (using glucose oxidase or paper chromatography to measure glucose levels) usually confirms the diagnosis. However, liver biopsy showing a deficiency in fructose-1-phosphate aldolase may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Supportive values may include decreased serum inorganic phosphorus levels. Urine studies may show fructosuria and albuminuria. Treatment Treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance consists of exclusion of fructose and sucrose (cane sugar or table sugar) from the diet. Otherwise, treatment is supportive as the patient's progress is monitored. Special considerations Tell the patient to avoid fruits containing fructose and vegetables containing sucrose (sugar beets, sweet potatoes, and peas), because sucrose is digested to glucose and fructose in the intestine. Fruits containing the least amount of fructose include strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, oranges, and grapefruits; others low in fructose are cherries, pears, bananas, grapes, and apples. Refer the patient and his family for genetic and dietary counseling as appropriate. Hyperlipoproteinemia Hyperlipoproteinemia occurs as five distinct metabolic disorders, all of which may be inherited. Types I and III are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits; Types II, IV, and V are transmitted as autosomal dominant traits. (See Types of hyperlipoproteinemia, page 572. )\\nAbout one in five persons with elevated plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels has hyperlipoproteinemia. It's marked by increased plasma concentrations of one or more lipoproteins. Hyperlipoproteinemia may also occur secondary to other conditions, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, or renal disease. Causes and incidence This disorder affects lipid transport in serum and produces varied clinical changes, from relatively mild symptoms that can\\nbe corrected by dietary management to potentially fatal pancreatitis. Complications Coronary artery disease Pancreatitis Signs and symptoms Type I: recurrent attacks of severe abdominal pain similar to pancreatitis, usually preceded by fat intake; abdominal spasm, rigidity, or rebound tenderness; hepatosplenomegaly, with liver or spleen tenderness; papular\\nor eruptive xanthomas (pinkish-yellow cutaneous deposits of fat) over pressure points and extensor surfaces; lipemia retinalis (reddish-white retinal vessels); malaise; anorexia; and fever Type II: tendinous xanthomas (firm masses) on the Achilles tendons and tendons of\\nthe hands and feet, tuberous xanthomas, xanthelasma, juvenile corneal arcus (opaque ring surrounding the corneal periphery), accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary artery disease, and recurrent polyarthritis and tenosynovitis P Type III: peripheral vascular disease manifested by claudication or tuboeruptive xanthomas (soft, inflamed, pedunculated lesions) over the elbows and knees; palmar xanthomas on the hands, particularly the fingertips; premature atherosclerosis Type IV: predisposition to atherosclerosis and early coronary artery disease, exacerbated by excessive calorie intake, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension Type V: abdominal pain (most common), pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, eruptive xanthomas on extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, lipemia retinalis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Treatment The first goal is to identify and treat any underlying problem such as diabetes. If no underlying problem exists, the primary treatment of Types II, III, and IV is dietary management, especially restriction of cholesterol intake, possibly supplemented by drug therapy (cholestyramine, clofibrate, niacin) to lower plasma triglyceride or cholesterol level when diet alone is ineffective. TYPES OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA Type Causes and incidence Diagnostic findings I (Frederickson's hyperlipoproteinemia, fat- induced hyperlipemia, idiopathic familial) \\u25aa Deficient or abnormal lipoprotein lipase, resulting in decreased or absent post- heparin lipolytic activity \\u25aa Relatively rare \\u25aa Present at birth \\u25aa\\nChylomicrons (very-low- density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein), in plasma 14 hours or more\\nafter last meal \\u25aa Highly elevated serum chylomicrons and triglyceride levels; slightly elevated serum cholesterol levels \\u25aa Lower serum lipoprotein lipase levels \\u25aa Leukocytosis II (familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia, essential familial hypercholesterolemia) \\u25aa\\nDeficient cell surface receptor that regulates LDL degradation and cholesterol synthesis, resulting in increased levels of plasma LDL over joints and pressure points \\u25aa Onset between ages 10 and 30 \\u25aa Increased plasma concentrations of LDL \\u25aa Increased serum LDL and cholesterol levels \\u25aa Amniocentesis shows increased LDL levels III (familial broadbeta disease, dysbetalipoproteinemia, remnant removal disease, xanthoma tuberosum) \\u25aa Unknown underlying defect results in deficient conversion of triglyceriderich VLDL to LDL \\u25aa Uncommon; usually occurs after age 20 but can occur earlier in men \\u25aa Abnormal serum beta- lipoprotein \\u25aa Elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels \\u25aa Slightly elevated glucose tolerance \\u25aa Hyperuricemia IV (endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia) \\u25aa Usually occurs secondary to obesity, alcoholism, diabetes, or emotional disorders \\u25aa Relatively common, especially in middle-age men \\u25aa Elevated VLDL levels \\u25aa Abnormal levels of triglycerides in plasma; variable increase in serum \\u25aa Normal or slightly elevated serum cholesterol levels \\u25aa Mildly abnormal glucose tolerance \\u25aa Family history \\u25aa Early coronary artery disease V P (mixed hypertriglyceridemia, mixed hyperlipidemia) \\u25aa Defective triglyceride clearance causes pancreatitis; usually secondary to another disorder, such as obesity or nephrosis \\u25aa Uncommon; onset usually occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood \\u25aa Chylomicrons in plasma \\u25aa Elevated plasma VLDL levels \\u25aa Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels Type I hyperlipoproteinemia requires long-term weight reduction, with fat intake restricted to less than 20 g/day. A 20- to 40-g/day medium- chain triglyceride diet may be ordered to supplement calorie intake. The patient should also avoid alcoholic beverages, to decrease plasma triglyceride levels. The prognosis is good with treatment; without treatment, death can result from pancreatitis. For Type II, dietary management to restore normal lipid levels and decrease the risk of atherosclerosis includes restriction of cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg/ day for adults and less than 150\\nmg/day for children; triglycerides must be restricted to less than 100 mg/day for children and adults. Diet should also be high in polyunsaturated fats. In familial hypercholesterolemia, nicotinic acid with a bile acid usually normalizes low-density lipoprotein levels. For severely affected children, a portacaval shunt is a last resort to reduce plasma cholesterol levels. The prognosis remains poor regardless of treatment; in homozygotes, myocardial infarction usually causes death\\nbefore age 30. For Type III, dietary management includes restriction of cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg/day; carbohydrates must also be restricted, while polyunsaturated fats are increased. Clofibrate and niacin help lower blood lipid levels. Weight reduction is helpful. With strict adherence to prescribed diet, the prognosis is good. For Type IV, weight reduction may normalize blood lipid levels without additional treatment. Long-term dietary management includes restricted cholesterol intake, increased polyunsaturated fats, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages. Clofibrate and niacin may lower plasma lipid levels. The prognosis remains uncertain, however, because of predisposition to premature coronary artery disease. The most effective treatment for Type V is weight reduction and long- term maintenance of a low-fat diet. Alcoholic beverages must be avoided. Niacin, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, and a 20- to\\n40-g/day medium- chain triglyceride diet may prove helpful. The prognosis is uncertain because of the risk of pancreatitis. Increased fat intake may cause recurrent bouts of illness, possibly leading to pseudocyst formation, hemorrhage, and death. USING BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS Before giving the patient a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, to lower cholesterol levels, make certain he isn't taking a drug whose absorption is affected by bile acid sequestrants. For example, bile acid sequestrants decrease the absorption of diuretics\\nsuch as chlorothiazide. Other drugs affected besides diuretics include: beta-adrenergic blockers digitoxin fat-soluble vitamins folic acid thiazides thyroxine warfarin. Special considerations Nursing care for hyperlipoproteinemia emphasizes careful monitoring for adverse drug effects and teaching the importance of long-term dietary management. Administer cholestyramine before meals or before bedtime. This drug must not be given with other medications. (See Using bile acid sequestrants .)\\nWatch for adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, steatorrhea, rashes, and hyperchloremic acidosis. Also watch for malabsorption of other medications and fat-soluble vitamins. P 4 Give clofibrate as ordered. Watch for adverse effects, such as cholelithiasis, cardiac arrhythmias, intermittent claudication, thromboembolism, nausea, weight gain (from fluid retention), and myositis. ALERT Don't administer niacin to patients with active peptic ulcers or hepatic disease. Use with caution in patients with diabetes. In other patients, watch for adverse effects, such as flushing, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, and exacerbation of inactive peptic ulcers. Urge the patient to adhere to the ordered diet (usually 1,000 to 1,500 calories/day) and to avoid excess sugar and\\nalcoholic beverages, to minimize his intake of saturated fats (higher in meats, coconut oil), and to increase his intake of polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oils). Instruct the patient, for the 2 weeks preceding serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride tests, to maintain a steady weight and to adhere strictly to the prescribed diet. He should also fast for 12 hours preceding the test. Instruct women with elevated serum lipid levels to avoid hormonal contraceptives or drugs that contain estrogen. Gaucher's disease Gaucher's disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, causes an abnormal accumulation of glucocerebrosides in reticuloendothelial cells. It occurs in three forms: Type I (adult); Type II (infantile); and Type III (juvenile). Type II can prove fatal within 9 months of onset, usually from pulmonary involvement. Causes and incidence Gaucher's disease results from an autosomal recessive inheritance, which causes decreased activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency leads to an accumulation of glucosylceramide in the storage compartments (lysosomes)\\nof certain body cells. Glucosylceramide buildup occurs in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow, eventually leading to decreased production of red blood cells (anemia) and thinning of the bones (osteopenia). There are three forms of Gaucher's disease, classified by\\nage of onset and the presence or absence of neurologic involvement. Type I, characterized by lack of neurologic involvement, is the most common form affecting both children and adults and is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, affecting anywhere from 1 of 500 to 1,000 births. Type II usually presents in infancy with severe neurologic involvement, resulting in seizures and central nervous system damage. Type II also presents with spleen and bone marrow damage. Type III typically has mild neurologic involvement and runs a slower, more favorable course. The incidence of Types II and III is 1 of 50,000 to 100,000 births. The juvenile form can begin in childhood, typically in the teenage years, and cause spleen, bone marrow, and neurologic damage. Complications Neurologic impairment Portal hypertension Pathological fractures Anemia Respiratory failure (Type II) Signs and symptoms The key signs of all types of Gaucher's disease are hepatosplenomegaly and bone lesions. In Type I, bone lesions lead to thinning of cortices, pathologic fractures, collapsed hip joints and, eventually, vertebral compression. Severe episodic pain may develop in the legs, arms, and back but usually not until adolescence. (The adult form of Gaucher's disease is generally diagnosed while the patient is in\\nhis teens; the word \\u201cadult\\u201d is used loosely here.) Other clinical effects of Type I are fever, P abdominal distention (from hypotonicity of the large bowel), respiratory problems (pneumonia or, rarely, cor pulmonale), easy bruising and bleeding, anemia and, rarely, pancytopenia. Older patients may develop a yellow pallor and brown-yellow pigmentation on the face and legs. In Type II, motor dysfunction and spasticity occur at age\\n6 to 7 months. Other signs of the infantile form of Gaucher's disease include abdominal distention, strabismus, muscle hypertonicity, retroflexion of the head, neck rigidity, dysphagia, laryngeal stridor, hyperreflexia, seizures, respiratory distress, and easy bruising and bleeding. Clinical effects of Type III after infancy include seizures, hypertonicity, strabismus, poor coordination and mental ability and, possibly, easy bruising and bleeding. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Bone marrow aspiration showing Gaucher's cells and direct assay of glucocerebrosidase activity, which can be performed on venous blood, confirms this diagnosis. Supportive laboratory results include increased serum acid phosphatase level, decreased platelets and serum iron level and, in\\nType III, abnormal EEG after infancy. Treatment Treatment is mainly supportive and consists of vitamins, supplemental iron or liver extract to prevent anemia caused by iron deficiency and to alleviate other hematologic problems, blood transfusions for anemia, splenectomy for thrombocytopenia, and strong analgesics for bone pain. Injections of a replacement synthetic enzyme have proven helpful. Gene therapy is an experimental approach. An oral treatment with N-butyl deoxynojirimycin (OGT 918), which inhibits glucocerebrosidase formation, is being evaluated. Clinical trials have shown improvement in the key clinical features of Gaucher's disease, including liver and spleen size and, to a lesser degree, blood counts. Special considerations In the patient confined to bed, prevent pathologic fractures by turning him carefully. If he is ambulatory, make\\nsure that he's assisted when getting out of bed or walking. Observe closely for changes in pulmonary status. Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures to the patient or his parents. Help the patient accept the limitations imposed by this disorder. Recommend genetic counseling for patients with a family history of Gaucher's disease. Prenatal testing can determine if a fetus has the syndrome. Porphyrias Porphyrias are metabolic disorders that affect the biosynthesis of heme (a component of hemoglobin) and cause excessive production and excretion of porphyrins or their precursors. Porphyrins, which are present in all protoplasm, figure prominently in energy storage and utilization. Classification of porphyrias depends on the site of excessive porphyrin production; they may be erythropoietic (erythroid cells in bone marrow), hepatic (in the liver), or erythrohepatic (in bone marrow and liver). (See Types of porphyria, pages 576 and 577.)\\nAn acute episode of intermittent hepatic porphyria may cause fatal respiratory paralysis. In the other forms of porphyrias, the prognosis is good with proper treatment. PREVENTION PREVENTING PORPHYRIA Precipitating factors may lead to signs and symptoms of porphyria. Encourage the patient to avoid: crash dieting fasting specific drugs such as alcohol, barbiturates, and estrogens P stress infection. Helpful hints Stress management techniques may help because emotional stress may also precipitate an attack. Reduce infection risk with proper hand washing and avoiding people with known infection. Genetic counseling may also be of benefit to prospective parents with a family history of porphyria. Causes and incidence Porphyrias are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, except for G\\u00fcnther's disease (autosomal recessive trait) and toxic-acquired porphyria (usually from ingestion of or exposure to lead). Menstruation often precipitates acute porphyria in premenopausal women. (See Preventing porphyria. ) TYPES OF PORPHYRIA Porphyria Signs and symptoms Treatment Erythropoietic porphyria G\\u00fcnther's disease \\u25aa Usual onset before age 5 \\u25aa\\nRed urine (earliest, most characteristic sign); severe cutaneous photosensitivity, leading to vesicular or bullous eruptions on exposed areas and, eventually, scarring and ulceration \\u25aa Hypertrichosis \\u25aa Brown-stained or redstained teeth \\u25aa Splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia \\u25aa Oral beta-carotene to prevent photosensitivity reactions \\u25aa Anti-inflammatory ointments \\u25aa Prednisone to reverse anemia \\u25aa Packed red cells to inhibit erythropoiesis and excreted porphyrins \\u25aa Hemin for recurrent attacks \\u25aa Splenectomy for hemolytic anemia \\u25aa Topical dihydroxyacetone and lawsone sunscreen filter Erythrohepatic porphyria Protoporphyria \\u25aa Usually affects children \\u25aa Occurs most often in males \\u25aa Photosensitive dermatitis \\u25aa Hemolytic anemia \\u25aa Chronic hepatic disease \\u25aa Avoidance of causative factors \\u25aa Beta-carotene to reduce photosensitivity Toxic-acquired porphyria \\u25aa Usually affects children \\u25aa Significant mortality \\u25aa Acute colicky pain \\u25aa Anorexia, nausea, vomiting \\u25aa Neuromuscular weakness \\u25aa Behavioral changes \\u25aa Seizures, coma \\u25aa Chlorpromazine I.V. to relieve pain and GI symptoms \\u25aa Avoidance of lead exposure Hepatic porphyria Acute intermittent porphyria \\u25aa Most common form \\u25aa Affects females most often, usually \\u25aa Colicky abdominal pain with fever, general malaise, and hypertension \\u25aa Peripheral neuritis, behavioral changes, possibly leading to frank psychosis \\u25aa Possible respiratory paralysis \\u25aa Chlorpromazine I.V. to relieve abdominal pain and control psychic abnormalities between ages 15 and 40 \\u25aa Avoidance of barbiturates, infections, alcohol, and fasting \\u25aa Hemin for recurrent attacks \\u25aa High-carbohydrate diet Variegate porphyria \\u25aa Usual onset between ages 30 and 50 \\u25aa Occurs almost exclusively among South African whites \\u25aa Affects males and females equally \\u25aa Skin lesions, extremely fragile skin in exposed areas \\u25aa Hypertrichosis \\u25aa Hyperpigmentation \\u25aa Abdominal pain during acute attack \\u25aa Neuropsychiatric manifestations \\u25aa High-carbohydrate diet \\u25aa Avoidance of sunlight, or wearing protective clothing when avoidance isn't possible \\u25aa Hemin for recurrent attacks Porphyria cutanea tarda \\u25aa Most frequent in men ages 40 to 60 \\u25aa Highest incidence in South Africans \\u25aa Facial pigmentation \\u25aa Red-brown urine \\u25aa Photosensitive dermatitis \\u25aa Hypertrichosis \\u25aa Avoidance of precipitating factors, such as alcohol and estrogens \\u25aa Phlebotomy at 2- week intervals to lower serum iron level Hereditary coproporphyria \\u25aa Rare \\u25aa Affects males and females \\u25aa Asymptomatic or mild neurologic, abdominal, or psychiatric symptoms \\u25aa High-carbohydrate diet P equally \\u25aa Avoidance of barbiturates \\u25aa Hemin for recurrent attacks Complications Neurologic and hepatic dysfunction (hepatic) Cholelithiasis Coma Flaccid paralysis, respiratory paralysis, and death (acute intermittent) Hemolytic anemia (erythropoietic) Signs and symptoms Porphyrias are generally marked by photosensitivity, acute abdominal pain, and neuropathy. Hepatic porphyrias may produce a complex syndrome marked by distinct neurologic and hepatic dysfunction: Neurologic symptoms include chronic brain syndrome, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic effects, tachycardia, labile hypertension, severe colicky lower abdominal pain, and constipation. During an acute attack, fever, leukocytosis, and fluid and electrolyte imbalance may occur. Structural hepatic effects include fatty infiltration of the liver, hepatic siderosis, and focal hepatocellular necrosis. Skin lesions may cause itching and burning, erythema, and altered pigmentation and edema in areas exposed to light. Some chronic skin changes include milia (white papules on the hands' dorsal aspects) and hirsutism on the upper cheeks and periorbital\\nareas. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS P Generally, diagnosis requires screening tests for porphyrins or their precursors (such as aminolevulinic acid [ALA] and porphobilinogen [PBG]) in urine, stool, blood or, occasionally, skin biopsy. A urinary lead level of 0.2 mg/L confirms toxic-acquired porphyria. Other laboratory values may include increased serum iron levels in porphyria cutanea tarda; leukocytosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels in acute intermittent porphyria. DRUGS THAT AGGRAVATE PORPHYRIA Make sure the patient with porphyria doesn't receive any of the following drugs, which are known to precipitate signs and symptoms of porphyria: Alcohol Barbiturates Carbamazepine Carisoprodol Chloramphenicol Chlordiazepoxide Danazol Diazepam Ergot alkaloids Estrogens Griseofulvin Imipramine Meprobamate Methsuximide Methyldopa Pentazocine Phenytoin Progesterones Sulfonamides Tolbutamide Treatment Treatment for porphyrias includes avoiding overexposure to the sun and using beta-carotene to reduce photosensitivity, as well as support for acute and long-term management. Hemin (an enzyme-inhibitor derived from processed red blood cells) is given to control recurrent attacks of acute intermittent porphyria, G\\u00fcnther's disease, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria. A high-carbohydrate diet decreases urinary excretion of ALA and PBG, with restricted fluid intake to inhibit release of antidiuretic hormone. Special considerations Warn the patient to avoid excessive sun exposure, use a sunscreen when outdoors, and take a beta-carotene supplement to reduce photosensitivity. Encourage a high-carbohydrate diet. Administer beta-carotene and hemin, as ordered. Advise the patient to avoid drugs that may precipitate signs and symptoms of porphyrias. (See Drugs that aggravate porphyria. ) Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome\\u2014also called syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, dysmetabolic syndrome, and multiple metabolic syndrome \\u2014 is a cluster of conditions characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood glucose (type 2 diabetes mellitus), insulin resistance, high blood cholesterol and triglycerides, and high blood pressure. More than 22% of people in the United States meet three or more of these criteria, raising P their risk of heart disease and stroke and placing them at high risk for dying of myocardial infarction. In the normal digestion process, the intestines break down food into its basic components, one of which is glucose. Glucose provides energy for cellular activity, while excess glucose is stored in\\ncells for future use. Insulin, a hormone secreted in the pancreas, guides glucose into storage cells. However, in people with metabolic syndrome, glucose is insulin- resistant and doesn't respond to insulin's attempt to guide it into storage cells. Excess insulin is then required to overcome this resistance. This excess in quantity and force of insulin causes damage to the lining of the arteries, promotes fat storage deposits, and prevents fat breakdown. This series of events can lead to diabetes, blood clots, and coronary events. Causes and incidence Abdominal obesity is a strong predictor of metabolic syndrome because abdominal fat tends to be more resistant to insulin than fat in other areas. This increases the release of free fatty acid into the portal system, leading to increased apolipoprotein B, increased\\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL), decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased triglyceride levels. As a result, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor because a hallmark for metabolic syndrome is a fasting glucose level greater than 110 mg/dl. People with diabetes develop atherosclerotic heart disease at\\na younger age than other people. They're also at increased risk of macrovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease). Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. Insulin resistance and dyslipidemia are also risk factors\\nbecause insulin resistance leads to hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, damaged endothelium, and cardiovascular disease. Insulin is also responsible for reducing the amount of free fatty acids in the liver. However, people with insulin resistance have an increased amount of free fatty acids reaching the liver, resulting in high triglycerides and LDLs and producing an abnormal endothelium and atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is a risk factor because the combination of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and abdominal obesity leads to hypertension and its harmful cardiovascular effects. Moreover, insulin resistance promotes salt sensitivity in people with high blood pressure. Research also indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition to metabolic syndrome. Complications Coronary artery disease Diabetes mellitus Hyperlipidemia Signs and symptoms Assessment commonly reveals a history of hypertension, abdominal obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and a family history of metabolic syndrome. Physical findings include abdominal obesity (evidenced by a waist of more than 40\\u2033 [101.6 cm] in men and 35\\u2033 [88.9 cm] in women), blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or higher, and a fasting blood glucose level that's 100 mg/dl or higher. The patient may feel tired, especially after eating, and may have difficulty losing weight. If left untreated, such complications as coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and premature death may develop. Diagnosis Blood studies commonly indicate elevated blood glucose levels, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated serum uric acid. Use of lipid profile studies reveal elevated LDL levels, low HDL levels, and elevated triglycerides. Further diagnostic procedures are nonspecific, but may be performed to detect hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Treatment P Lifestyle modification, focusing on weight reduction and exercise, is an important part of the treatment regimen. Modest weight reduction through diet and exercise considerably improves hemoglobin A 1c levels, reduces insulin resistance, improves blood lipid levels, and decreases blood pressure\\u2014all elements of metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, losing an average of 7% of body weight reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%. To improve cardiovascular health, a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low-fat dairy products combined with regular exercise is recommended. Moreover, nutrient-dense,\\nlow-energy foods should replace low-nutrient, high-calorie foods. Meal replacements and shakes may also reduce risk factors for metabolic syndrome and improve weight loss. (See Therapeutic lifestyle-change diet, page 580.) A regular exercise program of moderate physical activity,\\nin addition to dietary modifications, promotes weight loss, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces blood glucose levels. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health, a person should exercise moderately for a minimum of 30 minutes on most (if not all) days of the week. The selected exercise program should improve cardiovascular conditioning, increase strength through resistance training, and improve flexibility. Medications may be used in the treatment of metabolic syndrome for patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 or greater in the presence of other risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) or for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or greater without other risk factors.\\nWeight loss drugs may also be added to lifestyle changes if the patient\\nhasn't achieved significant weight loss after 12 weeks. THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLE-CHANGE DIET The therapeutic lifestyle-change diet is low in saturated fats and cholesterol to reduce blood cholesterol levels and prevent development of heart disease and its complications. Nutrient Recommended intake Saturated fat * < 7% of total calories Polyunsaturated fat Up to 10% of total calories Monounsaturated fat Up to 20% of total calories Total fat 25% to 35% of total calories Carbohydrate ** 50% to 60% of total calories Fiber 20 to 30 gm/day Protein Approximately 15% of total calories Cholesterol < 200 mg/day Total calories *** Balance energy intake and expenditure to maintain desirable body weight and prevent weight gain * Trans fatty acids are another low-density lipoprotein-raising fat that should be minimized or avoided. ** Carbohydrates\\nshould be derived predominantly from foods rich in complex carbohydrates, including grains\\u2014especially whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. *** Daily expenditure should include at least moderate physical activity (contributing about 200 kcal/day). Source: The National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute. Available at: www.nhlbi.nih.gov/chd/lifestyles.htm. Pharmacologic treatment may also be indicated. Phentermine is used for short-term treatment of obesity in conjunction with diet and exercise. The only two drugs that have been approved for long-term weight loss are orlistat (Xenical) and sibutramine (Meridia). Orlistat works by decreasing the absorption of dietary fat by inhibiting\\npancreatic lipase, P which is needed for fat breakdown and absorption. However, because absorption of fat-soluble vitamins is reduced, the patient may require vitamin supplementation. Studies show that when obese patients take orlistat in conjunction with dieting, they achieve greater weight loss and serum glucose control than by dieting alone. Sibutramine promotes weight loss by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and increases the satietyproducing effects of serotonin. Further, it reduces the drop in metabolic rate that commonly occurs with weight loss. Surgical treatment of obesity, such as through gastric bypass procedures, produces a greater degree and duration of weight loss\\nthan other therapies and improves or resolves most of the factors of metabolic syndrome. Candidates for surgical intervention include patients with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 or those with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 with obesity-related medical conditions. Gastric bypass procedures produce permanent weight loss in the majority of patients. Special considerations Monitor the patient's blood pressure, blood glucose, blood cholesterol, and insulin levels. Because research indicates that longer lifestyle modification programs are associated with improved weight loss\\nmaintenance, encourage patients with metabolic syndrome to begin an exercise and weight loss program with a friend or family member. Assist him in exploring options and support his efforts. To improve compliance, schedule frequent follow-up appointments with the patient. At that time, review his food diaries and exercise logs. Be positive and promote his active participation and partnership in his treatment plan. A patient planning gastric bypass surgery should receive psychological and nutritional counseling before and after\\nthe surgery to assit with diet and lifestyle changes. HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCE Potassium imbalance Potassium, a cation that's the dominant cellular electrolyte, facilitates contraction of both skeletal and smooth muscles\\u2014including myocardial contraction\\u2014and figures prominently in nerve impulse conduction, acid- base balance, enzyme action, and cell membrane function. Because serum potassium level has such a narrow range\\n(3.5 to 5 mEq/L), a slight deviation in either direction can produce profound clinical consequences. Paradoxically, both hypokalemia (potassium deficiency) and hyperkalemia (potassium excess) can lead to muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis, because both create an ionic imbalance in neuromuscular tissue excitability. Both conditions also diminish excitability and conduction rate of the heart muscle, which may\\nlead to cardiac arrest. (See Clinical effects of potassium imbalance, page 582.) Causes and incidence Because many foods contain potassium, hypokalemia seldom results from a dietary deficiency. Instead, potassium loss may result from: excessive GI losses, such as diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, or chronic laxative abuse (Vomiting and gastric suction cause dehydration, resulting in hyperaldosteronism [sodium retention and potassium excretion occur].) trauma (injury, burns, or surgery), in which damaged cells release potassium, which enters serum or extracellular fluid, to be excreted in the urine chronic renal disease, with tubular potassium wasting certain drugs, especially potassium-wasting diuretics, steroids, and certain sodium-containing antibiotics (carbenicillin) acid-base imbalances, which cause potassium shifting into cells without true depletion in alkalosis prolonged potassium-free I.V. therapy hyperglycemia, causing osmotic diuresis and glycosuria Cushing's syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, excessive licorice ingestion, and severe serum magnesium deficiency. P Hyperkalemia results from the kidneys' inability to excrete excessive amounts of potassium infused I.V. or administered orally; from decreased urine output, renal dysfunction or failure; or the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene, by patients\\nwith renal disease. It may also result from any injuries or conditions that release cellular potassium or favor its retention, such as burns, crushing injuries, failing renal function, adrenal gland insufficiency, dehydration, or diabetic acidosis. Complications Muscle weakness Flaccid paralysis Cardiac arrest Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum potassium levels less than 3.5 mEq/L confirm hypokalemia; serum levels greater than 5 mEq/L confirm hyperkalemia. Additional tests may be necessary to determine the imbalance's underlying cause. Hypokalemia is also associated with hypomagnesemia, so further study of other electrolytes is warranted. Treatment For hypokalemia, replacement therapy with potassium chloride (I.V. or orally) is the primary treatment. When diuresis is necessary, spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may be administered concurrently with a potassium-wasting diuretic to minimize potassium loss. Hypokalemia can be prevented by giving a maintenance dose of potassium I.V. to patients who may not take anything by mouth and to others predisposed to potassium loss. CLINICAL EFFECTS OF POTASSIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypokalemia Hyperkalemia Acid-base balance \\u25aa Metabolic alkalosis \\u25aa Metabolic acidosis Cardiovascular \\u25aa\\nDizziness, hypotension, arrhythmias, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (flattened T waves, elevated U waves, depressed ST segment), cardiac arrest (with serum potassium levels < 2.5 mEq/L) \\u25aa\\nTachycardia and later bradycardia, ECG changes (tented and elevated T waves, widened QRS complex, prolonged PR interval, flattened or absent P\\nwaves, depressed ST segment), cardiac arrest (with levels > 7 mEq/L) Gastrointestinal \\u25aa Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal distention, paralytic ileus or decreased peristalsis \\u25aa Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps Genitourinary \\u25aa Polyuria \\u25aa Oliguria, anuria Musculoskeletal \\u25aa Muscle weakness and fatigue, leg cramps \\u25aa Muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis Neurologic \\u25aa Malaise, irritability, confusion, mental depression, speech changes, decreased reflexes, respiratory paralysis \\u25aa Hyperreflexia progressing to weakness, numbness, tingling, flaccid paralysis For hyperkalemia, rapid infusion of 10% calcium gluconate\\ndecreases myocardial irritability and temporarily prevents cardiac arrest but doesn't correct serum potassium excess; it's also contraindicated in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. As an emergency measure, sodium bicarbonate I.V. increases pH and causes potassium to shift back into the cells. Insulin and 10% to 50% glucose I.V. also move potassium back into cells. Infusions should be followed by dextrose 5% in water because infusion of 10% to 15% glucose will stimulate endogenous insulin secretion. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate with 70% sorbitol produces exchange of sodium ions for potassium ions in\\nthe intestine. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis also aids in removal\\nof excess potassium. P Special considerations For hypokalemia: Check serum potassium and other electrolyte levels in patients apt to develop potassium imbalance and in\\nthose requiring potassium replacement; they risk overcorrection to hyperkalemia. Assess intake and output carefully. Remember, the kidneys excrete 80% to 90% of ingested potassium. Never give supplementary potassium to a patient whose urine output is below 600 ml/day. Also, measure GI loss from suctioning or vomiting. Administer slow-release potassium or dilute oral potassium supplements in 4 oz (118 ml) or more of water or other fluid to reduce gastric and small-bowel irritation. Determine the patient's chloride level. As ordered, give a potassium chloride supplement if the level is low; potassium gluconate if it's normal. Give potassium I.V. only after it's diluted in solution (usually, 10 mEq/100 ml of fluid); potassium is very\\nirritating to vascular, subcutaneous, and fatty tissues and may cause phlebitis or tissue necrosis if it infiltrates. Infuse slowly (no more than 20 mEq/ L/hour through central administration or 10 mEq/hour through peripheral administration) to prevent hyperkalemia. ALERT Never administer by I.V. push or bolus; it may cause cardiac arrest. Carefully monitor patients receiving cardiac glycosides because hypokalemia enhances the action of these drugs and may produce signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and arrhythmias). To prevent hypokalemia, instruct patients (especially those predisposed to hypokalemia due to long-term diuretic therapy) to include in their diet foods rich in potassium\\u2014oranges, bananas, tomatoes, milk, dried fruits, apricots, peanuts and dark green,\\nleafy vegetables. ALERT Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and respond to any irregularities immediately. For hyperkalemia: As in hypokalemia, frequently monitor serum potassium and other electrolyte levels, and carefully record intake and output. Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or rectally (by retention enema) in patients with significant potassium elevations because of intravascular sodium shifting. Watch for\\nsigns of hypokalemia with prolonged use and for clinical effects of hypoglycemia (muscle weakness, syncope, hunger, diaphoresis) with repeated insulin and glucose treatment. Watch for signs of hyperkalemia in predisposed patients, especially those with poor urine output or those receiving potassium supplements orally or I.V. Administer no more than 10 to 20 mEq/L of potassium chloride per hour; check the I.V. infusion site for signs of phlebitis or infiltration of potassium into tissues. Also, before giving a blood transfusion, check to see how long ago the blood was donated; cell hemolysis in older blood releases potassium. Infuse only fresh blood for patients with average to high serum potassium levels. Watch for and report cardiac arrhythmias. Sodium imbalance Sodium is the major cation (90%) in extracellular fluid (ECF); potassium, the major cation in intracellular fluid. During repolarization, the sodium-potassium pump continually shifts sodium into\\nthe cells and potassium out of the cells; during depolarization, it does the reverse. Sodium cation functions include maintaining tonicity and concentration of ECF, acid-base balance (reabsorption of sodium ion and excretion of hydrogen ion), nerve conduction and neuromuscular function, glandular secretion, and water balance. Although the body requires only 2 to 4 g of sodium daily, most Americans consume 6 to 10 g\\ndaily (mostly sodium P chloride, as table salt), excreting excess sodium through the kidneys and skin. A low-sodium diet or excessive use of diuretics may induce hyponatremia (decreased serum sodium concentration); dehydration may induce hypernatremia (increased serum sodium concentration). Causes and incidence Hyponatremia can result from: excessive GI loss of water and electrolytes due to vomiting, suctioning, or diarrhea; excessive perspiration or fever; use of potent diuretics; or tap-water enemas (When such losses decrease circulating fluid volume, increased secretion\\nof antidiuretic hormone [ADH] promotes maximum water reabsorption, which further dilutes serum sodium. These factors are especially likely to cause hyponatremia when combined with excessive intake of free water.) excessive drinking of water, infusion of I.V. dextrose in water without other solutes, malnutrition or starvation, or a low-sodium diet, usually in combination with one of the\\nother causes trauma, surgery (wound drainage), or burns, which cause sodium to shift into damaged cells CLINICAL EFFECTS OF SODIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hyponatremia Hypernatremia Cardiovascular \\u25aa Hypotension; tachycardia; with severe deficit, vasomotor collapse, thready pulse \\u25aa Hypertension, tachycardia, pitting edema, excessive weight gain Cutaneous \\u25aa Cold, clammy skin; decreased skin turgor \\u25aa Flushed skin; dry, sticky mucous membranes Gastrointestinal \\u25aa Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps \\u25aa Rough, dry tongue; intense thirst Genitourinary \\u25aa Oliguria or anuria \\u25aa Oliguria Neurologic \\u25aa Anxiety, headaches, muscle twitching and weakness, seizures \\u25aa Fever, agitation, restlessness, seizures Respiratory \\u25aa Cyanosis with severe deficiency \\u25aa Dyspnea, respiratory arrest, and death (from dramatic rise in osmotic pressure) adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease) or hypoaldosteronism cirrhosis of the liver with ascites syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), resulting from brain tumor, stroke, pulmonary disease, or neoplasm with ectopic ADH production. Certain drugs, such as chlorpropamide and clofibrate, may produce a SIADH-like syndrome. Causes of hypernatremia include: decreased water intake (When severe vomiting and diarrhea cause water loss that exceeds sodium loss, serum sodium levels rise, but overall extracellular fluid volume decreases.) excess adrenocortical hormones, as in Cushing's syndrome ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) salt intoxication (less common), which may be produced by excessive ingestion of table salt. Complications Seizures Coma Permanent neurologic damage Signs and symptoms Sodium imbalance has profound physiologic effects and can\\ninduce severe central nervous system, cardiovascular, and GI abnormalities. For example, hyponatremia may cause renal dysfunction or,\\nif serum sodium loss is abrupt or severe, seizures; hypernatremia may produce P pulmonary edema, circulatory disorders, and decreased level of consciousness. (See Clinical effects of sodium imbalance .) Diagnosis Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level less than\\n135 mEq/L; hypernatremia, as a serum sodium level greater than 145 mEq/L. However, additional laboratory studies are necessary to determine etiology and to differentiate between a true deficit and an apparent deficit due to sodium shift or to hypervolemia or hypovolemia. In true hyponatremia, supportive values include urine sodium greater than 100 mEq/24 hours, with low serum osmolality; in true hypernatremia, urine sodium level is less than 40 mEq/24 hours, with high serum osmolality. (See Diagnosing hyponatremia. ) DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPONATREMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist in treating a patient with hyponatremia. P Treatment Therapy for mild hyponatremia usually consists of restricted free-water intake when it's due to hemodilution, SIADH, or such conditions as heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal failure. If fluid restriction alone fails to normalize serum sodium levels, demeclocycline or lithium, which blocks ADH action in the renal tubules, can be used to promote water excretion. In extremely rare instances of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, when serum sodium levels fall below 110 mEq/L, treatment may include infusion of 3% or 5% saline solution. Treatment with saline infusion requires careful monitoring of venous pressure to prevent potentially fatal circulatory overload. The aim of treatment of secondary hyponatremia is to correct the underlying disorder. Primary treatment of hypernatremia is administration of salt-free solutions (such as dextrose in water) to return serum sodium levels to normal, followed by infusion of half-normal saline solution to\\nprevent hyponatremia. Other measures include a sodium-restricted diet and discontinuation of drugs that promote sodium retention. Special considerations When managing the patient with hyponatremia: Watch for and report extremely low serum sodium and accompanying serum chloride levels. Monitor urine specific gravity and other laboratory results. Record fluid intake and output accurately, and weigh the patient daily. During administration of isosmolar or hyperosmolar saline solution, watch closely for signs of hypervolemia (dyspnea, crackles, engorged jugular or hand veins). Report conditions that may cause excessive sodium loss (diaphoresis or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, and severe burns). Refer the patient on maintenance dosage of diuretics to a dietitian for instruction about dietary sodium intake. PREVENTION To prevent hyponatremia, administer isosmolar solutions. When managing the patient with hypernatremia: Measure serum sodium levels at least every\\n6 hours until stabilized. Monitor vital signs for changes, especially for rising pulse rate. Watch for signs of hypervolemia, especially in the patient receiving I.V. fluids. Record fluid intake and output accurately, checking for body fluid loss. Weigh the patient daily. Obtain a drug history to check for drugs that promote sodium retention. Explain the importance of sodium restriction and teach the patient how to plan a low-sodium diet. Closely\\nmonitor the serum sodium levels of high-risk patients. Calcium imbalance Calcium plays an indispensable role in cell permeability,\\nbone and teeth formation, blood coagulation, transmission of nerve impulses, and normal muscle contraction. Nearly all (99%) of the body's calcium is found in the bones. The remaining 1% exists in the blood, with 50% of the remainder bound to plasma proteins and 40% ionized or free. The ionized calcium in the serum is critical to healthy neurologic\\nfunction. The parathyroid glands regulate ionized calcium and determine\\nits resorption into bone, absorption from the GI mucosa, and excretion in urine and feces. Severe calcium imbalance requires emergency treatment because a deficiency (hypocalcemia) can lead to tetany and seizures; an excess (hypercalcemia), to cardiac arrhythmias and coma. (See Clinical effects of calcium imbalance. ) Causes and incidence Common causes of hypocalcemia include: inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, in which inadequate levels of vitamin D inhibit intestinal absorption of calcium P hypoparathyroidism as a result of injury, disease, or surgery that decreases or eliminates secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is needed for calcium absorption and normal serum calcium levels malabsorption or loss of calcium from the GI tract, caused by increased intestinal motility from severe diarrhea or laxative abuse; can also result from inadequate levels of vitamin D or PTH, or a reduction in gastric acidity, decreasing the solubility of calcium salts CLINICAL EFFECTS OF CALCIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypocalcemia Hypercalcemia Cardiovascular \\u25aa Arrhythmias, hypotension \\u25aa Signs of heart block, cardiac arrest in systole, hypertension Gastrointestinal \\u25aa Increased GI motility, diarrhea \\u25aa Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, polydipsia Musculoskeletal \\u25aa\\nParesthesia (tingling and numbness of the fingers), tetany or painful tonic muscle spasms, facial spasms, abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, spasmodic contractions \\u25aa Weakness, muscle flaccidity, bone pain, pathologic fractures Neurologic \\u25aa Anxiety, irritability, twitching around mouth, laryngospasm, seizures, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign \\u25aa Drowsiness, lethargy, headaches, depression or apathy, irritability, confusion Other \\u25aa Blood-clotting abnormalities \\u25aa Renal polyuria, flank pain and, eventually, azotemia severe infections or burns, in which diseased and burned tissue traps calcium from the extracellular fluid overcorrection of acidosis, resulting in alkalosis, which causes decreased ionized calcium and induces symptoms of hypocalcemia pancreatic insufficiency, which may cause malabsorption of calcium and subsequent calcium loss in feces. In pancreatitis, participation of calcium ions in saponification contributes to calcium loss renal failure, resulting in excessive excretion of calcium secondary to increased retention of phosphate hypomagnesemia, which causes decreased PTH secretion and blocks the peripheral action of that hormone. Causes of hypercalcemia include the following: hyperparathyroidism, which increases serum\\ncalcium levels by promoting calcium absorption from the intestine, resorption from bone, and reabsorption from the kidneys hypervitaminosis D, which can promote increased absorption of calcium from the intestine tumors, which raise serum calcium levels by destroying bone or by releasing PTH or a PTH-like substance, osteoclastactivating factor, prostaglandins and, perhaps, a vitamin D-like sterol multiple fractures and prolonged immobilization, which release bone calcium and raise the serum calcium level multiple myeloma, which promotes loss of calcium from bone. Other causes include milk-alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, thiazide diuretics, and loss of serum albumin secondary to renal disease. Complications Laryngeal spasm, tetany, seizures and possibly respiratory arrest (hypocalcemia) coma and cardiac arrest (hypercalcemia) P TROUSSEAU'S SIGN To check for Trousseau's sign, apply a blood pressure cuff to the patient's arm. A carpopedal spasm that causes thumb adduction and phalangeal extension, as shown, confirms tetany. Signs and symptoms Calcium deficit causes nerve fiber irritability and repetitive muscle spasms. Consequently, characteristic symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral paresthesia, twitching, carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures and, possibly, cardiac arrhythmias. Chvostek's sign and\\nTrousseau's sign are reliable indicators of hypocalcemia. (See Trousseau's sign. Also see Chvostek's sign. ) Clinical effects of hypercalcemia include muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone, lethargy, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, polydipsia, and polyuria. Severe hypercalcemia (serum levels that exceed 15 mg/dl) may produce cardiac arrhythmias and, eventually, coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum calcium level less than 8.5 mg/ dl confirms hypocalcemia; a level more than 10.5 mg/dl confirms hypercalcemia. (However, because approximately one- half of serum calcium\\nis bound to albumin, changes in serum protein must be considered when interpreting serum calcium levels. A common conversion formula is calcium corrected = calcium actual + 0.8 \\u00d7 [4.0\\n- albumin level]. Ionized calcium levels are 4.65 to 5.28 mg/dl and are\\na measure of the fraction of serum calcium in ionized form.) The Sulkowitch urine test shows increased calcium precipitation in hypercalcemia. In hypocalcemia, an electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals lengthened QT interval, prolonged ST segment, and arrhythmias; in hypercalcemia, shortened QT interval and heart block. (See Diagnosing hypercalcemia, pages 590 and 591.) Treatment Treatment varies and requires correction of the acute imbalance, followed by maintenance therapy and correction of the underlying cause. Mild hypocalcemia may require nothing more than an adjustment in diet to allow adequate intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein, possibly with oral calcium supplements. Acute hypocalcemia is an emergency that needs immediate correction by I.V. administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. Chronic hypocalcemia also requires vitamin D supplements to facilitate GI absorption of calcium. To correct mild deficiency states, the amounts of vitamin D in most multivitamin preparations are adequate. For severe deficiency, vitamin D\\nis used in four forms: ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2 ), cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ), calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol, a synthetic form of vitamin D 2 . Treatment of hypercalcemia primarily eliminates excess serum calcium through hydration with normal saline solution, which promotes calcium excretion in the urine. Loop diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and P furosemide, also promote calcium excretion. (Thiazide diuretics are contraindicated in hypercalcemia because they inhibit calcium excretion.) Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and hydrocortisone, are helpful in treating sarcoidosis, hypervitaminosis D,\\nand certain tumors. Plicamycin can also lower serum calcium levels and is especially effective against hypercalcemia secondary to certain tumors. Calcitonin may also be helpful in certain instances. Sodium phosphate solution administered orally or by retention enema promotes calcium deposition in bone and inhibits its absorption from the GI tract. Special considerations Watch for hypocalcemia in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood; in those with chronic diarrhea, severe infections, and insufficient dietary intake of calcium and protein (especially in elderly patients); and in those who are hyperventilating. Check serum calcium level every 12 to 24 hours, and report a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dl immediately. When giving calcium supplements, frequently check the pH level because a pH lower than 7.45 inhibits calcium ionization. Check for Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs. Administer calcium gluconate slow I.V. in 5% dextrose in water ( never in saline solution, which encourages renal calcium loss). Don't add calcium gluconate I.V. to solutions containing bicarbonate; it will precipitate. When administering calcium solutions, watch for anorexia, nausea, and vomiting\\u2014possible signs of overcorrection to hypercalcemia. Never infuse more than 1g/hour, except in an emergency. Use a volume-control device to ensure proper flow rate. If the patient is receiving calcium chloride, watch for abdominal discomfort. ALERT Don't confuse calcium chloride with calcium gluconate in administration; 1 gm of calcium chloride has three times the calcium as 1 gm of calcium gluconate. Monitor the patient closely for a possible\\ndrug interaction if he's receiving cardiac glycosides with large doses of oral calcium supplements; watch for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, yellow vision, and cardiac arrhythmias). Administer oral calcium supplements 1 to 11/2 hours after meals or with milk. Provide a quiet, stress-free environment for the patient with tetany. Observe seizure precautions for patients with severe hypocalcemia. PREVENTION To prevent hypocalcemia, advise all patients\\u2014especially elderly patients\\u2014to eat foods rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, such as fortified milk and cheese. Explain how important calcium is for normal bone formation and blood coagulation. Discourage chronic use of laxatives. Also, warn hypocalcemic patients not to overuse antacids, because these may aggravate the condition. CHVOSTEK'S SIGN To check for Chvostek's sign, tap the facial nerve above the mandibular angle, adjacent to the earlobe. A facial muscle spasm that causes the patient's upper lip to twitch, as shown, confirms tetany. P If the patient has hypercalcemia: Check serum calcium level frequently. Watch for cardiac arrhythmias if serum calcium levels exceed their normal values of 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dl. Increase fluid intake to dilute calcium in serum and urine, and to prevent renal damage and dehydration.\\nWatch for signs of heart failure in patients receiving normal saline diuresis. Administer loop diuretics (not thiazide diuretics), as ordered. Monitor intake and output, and check urine for renal calculi and acidity. Provide acid-ash drinks, such as cranberry or\\nprune juice, because calcium salts are more soluble in acid than in alkali. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPERCALCEMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist with treatment of the patient with hypercalcemia. P P 2 Check ECG and vital signs frequently. In the patient receiving cardiac glycosides, watch for signs of toxicity, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia (often with arrhythmia). Ambulate the patient as soon as possible. Handle the patient with chronic hypercalcemia gently to prevent pathologic fractures. If the patient is bedridden, reposition him frequently and encourage range-of- motion exercises to promote circulation and prevent urinary stasis and calcium loss from bone. To prevent recurrence, suggest a lowcalcium diet, with increased fluid intake. Chloride imbalance Hypochloremia and hyperchloremia are, respectively, conditions of deficient or excessive serum levels of the chloride anion.\\nA predominantly extracellular anion, chloride accounts for two-thirds of all serum anions. Secreted by stomach mucosa as hydrochloric acid, it provides an acid medium that aids digestion and activation of enzymes. Chloride also participates in maintaining acid-base and body water balances, influences the osmolality or tonicity of extracellular fluid (ECF), plays a role in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in red blood cells, and helps activate salivary amylase (which, in turn, activates the digestive process). Causes and incidence Hypochloremia may result from: decreased chloride intake or absorption, as in low dietary sodium intake, sodium deficiency, potassium deficiency, metabolic alkalosis; prolonged use of mercurial diuretics; or administration of dextrose I.V. without electrolytes excessive chloride loss resulting from prolonged diarrhea or diaphoresis; loss of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions due to vomiting, gastric suctioning, or gastric surgery. Hyperchloremia may result from: excessive chloride intake or absorption \\u2014as in hyperingestion of ammonium chloride, or ureterointestinal anastomosis \\u2014allowing reabsorption of chloride by the bowel hemoconcentration from dehydration compensatory mechanisms for other metabolic abnormalities, as in metabolic acidosis, brain stem injury causing neurogenic hyperventilation, and hyperparathyroidism. Complications Depressed respirations leading to respiratory arrest (hypochloremia) Coma (hyperchloremia) Signs and symptoms Hypochloremia is usually associated with hyponatremia and\\nits characteristic muscle weakness and twitching because renal chloride loss always accompanies sodium loss, and sodium reabsorption isn't possible without chloride. However, if chloride depletion results from metabolic alkalosis secondary to loss of gastric secretions, chloride is lost independently from sodium; typical symptoms are muscle hypertonicity, tetany, and shallow, depressed breathing. Because of the natural affinity of sodium and chloride ions, hyperchloremia usually produces clinical effects associated with hypernatremia and resulting ECF volume excess (agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, pitting edema, dyspnea). Hyperchloremia associated with metabolic acidosis is due to excretion of base bicarbonate by the kidneys, and induces deep, rapid breathing; weakness; diminished cognitive ability; and, ultimately, coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum chloride level below 98 mEq/L confirms hypochloremia. (Supportive values in metabolic alkalosis include serum pH above 7.45 and serum carbon dioxide [CO 2 ] level above 32 mEq/L.) A serum chloride level above 108 mEq/L confirms hyperchloremia; with P metabolic acidosis, serum pH is below 7.35 and serum CO 2 level is below 22 mEq/L. Treatment Hypochloremia therapy aims to correct the condition that causes excessive chloride loss and to give oral replacement such as salty broth. When oral therapy isn't possible, or when emergency measures are necessary, treatment may\\ninclude normal saline solution I.V. (if hypovolemia is present) or chloride-containing drugs, such as ammonium chloride, to increase serum chloride levels, and potassium chloride for metabolic alkalosis. For severe hyperchloremic acidosis, treatment consists of sodium bicarbonate\\nI.V. to raise the serum bicarbonate level and permit renal excretion of\\nthe chloride anion, because bicarbonate and chloride compete for combination with sodium. For mild hyperchloremia, Ringer's lactate solution is administered; it converts to bicarbonate in the liver, thus increasing base bicarbonate to correct acidosis. In either kind of chloride imbalance, treatment must correct the underlying disorder. Special considerations When managing the patient with hypochloremia: Check serum chloride level frequently, particularly during I.V. therapy. Watch for signs of hyperchloremia or hypochloremia. Be alert for respiratory difficulty. To prevent hypochloremia, monitor laboratory results (serum electrolyte levels and blood gas values) and fluid intake and output of patients who are vulnerable to chloride imbalance, particularly those recovering from gastric surgery. Record and report excessive or continuous loss of gastric secretions. Also report prolonged infusion of dextrose in water without saline. When managing the patient with hyperchloremia: Check serum electrolyte levels every 3 to 6\\nhours. If the patient is receiving high doses of sodium bicarbonate, watch for signs of overcorrection (metabolic alkalosis, respiratory depression) or lingering signs of hyperchloremia, which indicate inadequate treatment. PREVENTION To prevent hyperchloremia, check laboratory results for elevated serum chloride levels or potassium imbalance if the patient is receiving I.V. solutions containing sodium chloride, and monitor fluid intake and output. Also, watch for signs of metabolic acidosis. When administering I.V. fluids containing Ringer's lactate solution, monitor flow rate according to the patient's age, physical condition, and bicarbonate level. Report any irregularities promptly. Magnesium imbalance Magnesium is the second most common cation in intracellular fluid. Although its major function is to enhance neuromuscular integration, it also stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, thus regulating intracellular fluid calcium levels. Therefore, magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) may result in transient\\nhypoparathyroidism or interference with the peripheral action of PTH. Magnesium may also regulate skeletal muscles through its influence on calcium utilization by depressing acetylcholine release at synaptic junctions. In addition, magnesium activates many enzymes for proper carbohydrate and protein metabolism, aids in cell metabolism and the transport of sodium and potassium across cell membranes, and influences sodium, potassium, calcium, and protein levels. About one-third of magnesium taken into the body is absorbed through the small intestine and is eventually excreted in the urine; the remaining unabsorbed magnesium is excreted in the stool. Because many common foods contain magnesium, a dietary deficiency is rare. Hypomagnesemia generally follows impaired absorption, too-rapid excretion, or inadequate intake during total parenteral nutrition. It frequently coexists with other electrolyte imbalances, especially low P calcium and potassium levels. Magnesium excess (hypermagnesemia) is common in patients with renal failure and excessive intake of magnesium-containing antacids. Causes and incidence Hypomagnesemia usually results from impaired absorption of magnesium in the intestines or excessive excretion in urine or stool.\\nPossible causes include: decreased magnesium intake or absorption, as in malabsorption syndrome, chronic diarrhea, or postoperative complications after bowel resection; chronic alcoholism; prolonged diuretic therapy, nasogastric suctioning, or administration of parenteral fluids without magnesium salts; and starvation or malnutrition excessive loss of magnesium, as in severe dehydration and diabetic acidosis; hyperaldosteronism and hypoparathyroidism, which result in hypokalemia and hypocalcemia; hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia; excessive release of adrenocortical hormones; and diuretic therapy. Hypermagnesemia results from the kidneys' inability to excrete magnesium that was either absorbed from the intestines or infused. Common causes of hypermagnesemia include: chronic renal insufficiency use of laxatives (magnesium sulfate, milk of magnesia, and magnesium citrate solutions), especially with renal insufficiency overuse of magnesium-containing antacids severe dehydration (resulting oliguria can cause magnesium retention) overcorrection of hypomagnesemia. Complications Cardiac arrhythmias, hypoparathyroidism, seizures, confusion and coma (hypomagnesemia) Complete heart block and respiratory paralysis (hypermagnesemia) Signs and symptoms Hypomagnesemia causes neuromuscular irritability and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypermagnesemia causes central nervous system and respiratory depression, in addition to neuromuscular and cardiac effects. (See Signs and symptoms of magnesium imbalance .) Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum magnesium level less than 1.5 mEq/ L confirms hypomagnesemia; a level greater than 2.5 mEq/L confirms hypermagnesemia. Low levels of other serum electrolytes (especially potassium and calcium) often coexist with hypomagnesemia. In fact, unresponsiveness to correct treatment for hypokalemia strongly suggests hypomagnesemia. Similarly, elevated levels of other serum electrolytes are associated with hypermagnesemia. Treatment Therapy for magnesium imbalance aims to identify and correct the underlying cause. Treatment of mild hypomagnesemia consists of daily magnesium supplements I.M. or orally; of severe hypomagnesemia, magnesium sulfate I.V. (10 to 40 mEq/L diluted in I.V. fluid). Magnesium\\nintoxication (a possible adverse effect) requires calcium gluconate I.V. Therapy for hypermagnesemia includes increased fluid intake and loop diuretics (such as furosemide) with impaired renal function; calcium gluconate (10%), a magnesium antagonist, for temporary\\nrelief of symptoms in an emergency; and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if renal function fails or if excess magnesium can't be eliminated. Special considerations P For patients with hypomagnesemia: Monitor serum electrolyte levels (including magnesium, calcium, and potassium) daily for mild deficits and every 6 to 12 hours during replacement therapy. Measure intake and output frequently. (Urine output shouldn't fall below 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/day in patients with healthy body weight; in heavier patients, less than 50 ml/hour is a cause for concern.) Remember, the kidneys excrete excess magnesium, and hypermagnesemia could occur with renal insufficiency. ALERT Monitor vital signs during I.V. therapy. Infuse magnesium replacement slowly and watch for bradycardia, heart block, and decreased respiratory rate. Have calcium gluconate I.V.\\navailable to reverse hypermagnesemia from overcorrection. In patients with torsade de pointes, elevated magnesium levels are therapeutic. Advise patients to eat foods high in magnesium, such as fish and green vegetables. Watch for and report signs of hypomagnesemia in patients with predisposing diseases or conditions, especially those not permitted anything by mouth or who receive I.V. fluids without magnesium. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MAGNESIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypomagnesemia Hypermagnesemia Cardiovascular \\u25aa Arrhythmias (such as torsade de pointes), vasomotor changes (vasodilation and hypotension) and, occasionally, hypertension \\u25aa Bradycardia, weak pulse, hypotension, heart block, cardiac arrest (common with serum levels of 25 mEq/L) Neurologic \\u25aa Confusion, delusions, hallucinations, seizures \\u25aa Drowsiness, flushing, lethargy, confusion, diminished sensorium Neuromuscular \\u25aa Hyperirritability, tetany, leg and foot cramps, Chvostek's sign (facial muscle spasms induced by tapping the branches of the facial nerve) \\u25aa Diminished reflexes, muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, respiratory muscle paralysis that may cause respiratory insufficiency For patients with hypermagnesemia: Frequently assess level of consciousness, muscle activity, and vital signs. Keep accurate intake and output records. Provide sufficient fluids for adequate hydration and maintenance of renal function. Report abnormal serum electrolyte levels immediately. Monitor and report electrocardiogram changes (peaked T waves, increased PR intervals, widened QRS complex). Watch patients receiving cardiac glycosides and calcium gluconate simultaneously, because calcium excess enhances digoxin action, predisposing the patient to digoxin toxicity. Advise patients, particularly elderly patients and patients with compromised renal function, not to abuse laxatives and antacids containing magnesium. Watch for signs of hypermagnesemia in predisposed patients. Observe closely for respiratory distress if magnesium serum levels rise above 10 mEq/L. Phosphorus imbalance Phosphorus exists primarily in inorganic combination with\\ncalcium in teeth and bones. In extracellular fluid, the phosphate ion supports several metabolic functions: utilization of B vitamins, acid-base homeostasis, bone formation, nerve and muscle activity, cell division, transmission of hereditary traits, and metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate is inversely regulated by calcium levels\\u2014an increase in phosphorus causes a P decrease in calcium. An imbalance causes hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia. Incidence of hypophosphatemia varies with the underlying cause; hyperphosphatemia occurs most often in\\nchildren, who tend to consume more phosphorus-rich foods and beverages than adults, and in children and adults with renal insufficiency. The prognosis for both conditions depends on the underlying cause. Causes and incidence Hypophosphatemia is usually the result of inadequate dietary intake; it's often related to malnutrition resulting from a prolonged catabolic state or chronic alcoholism. It may also stem from intestinal malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, hyperparathyroidism with resultant hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or deficiency of vitamin D, which is necessary for intestinal phosphorus absorption. Other causes include chronic use of antacids containing aluminum hydroxide, use of parenteral nutrition solution with inadequate phosphate content, renal tubular defects, tissue damage in which phosphorus is released by injured cells, and diabetic acidosis. FOODS HIGH IN PHOSPHORUS Food Portion Amount (mg) Almonds 2/3 cup 475 Beef liver (fried) 31/2 oz 476 Broccoli (cooked) 2/3 cup 62 Carbonated beverages 12 oz Up to 500 Milk (whole) 8 oz 93 Turkey (roasted) 31/2 oz 251 Hyperphosphatemia is generally secondary to hypocalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, hypoparathyroidism, or renal failure (often due to stress or injury). It may also result from overuse of laxatives with phosphates or phosphate enemas. Complications Hypophosphatemia \\u2014 heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and coma Hyperphosphatemia \\u2014 soft-tissue complications Signs and symptoms Hypophosphatemia produces anorexia, muscle weakness, tremor, paresthesia and, when persistent, osteomalacia, causing bone pain. Impaired red blood cell functions may occur in hypophosphatemia due to alterations in oxyhemoglobin dissociation, which may result in peripheral hypoxia. Hyperphosphatemia usually remains asymptomatic unless it results in hypocalcemia, with tetany and seizures. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum phosphorus levels less than 1.7 mEq/ L or 2.5 mg/dl confirm hypophosphatemia. Urine phosphorus levels above 1.3 g/24 hours support this diagnosis. Serum phosphorus levels above 2.6 mEq/L or 4.5 mg/dl confirm hyperphosphatemia. Supportive values include decreased levels of serum calcium (less than 9\\nmg/dl) and urine phosphorus (less than 0.9 g/24 hours). Treatment Treatment aims to correct the underlying cause of phosphorus imbalance. Until this is done, management of hypophosphatemia consists of phosphorus replacement with a high-phosphorus diet and oral administration of phosphate salt tablets or capsules. (See Foods high in phosphorus .)\\nSevere hypophosphatemia requires I.V. infusion of P potassium phosphate. Severe hyperphosphatemia may require peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis\\nto lower the serum phosphorus level. Special considerations Carefully monitor serum electrolyte, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Report any changes immediately. To manage hypophosphatemia: Record intake and output accurately. Administer potassium phosphate slow I.V. to prevent overcorrection to hyperphosphatemia. Assess renal function and be alert for hypocalcemia when giving phosphate supplements. If phosphate salt tablets cause nausea, use capsules instead. To prevent recurrence, advise the patient to follow a high-phosphorus diet containing milk and milk products, kidney, liver, turkey, and dried fruits. To manage hyperphosphatemia: Monitor intake and output. If urine output\\nfalls below 25 ml/hour or 600 ml/day, notify the physician immediately,\\nbecause decreased output can seriously affect renal clearance of excess\\nserum phosphorus. Watch for signs of hypocalcemia, such as muscle twitching and tetany, which often accompany hyperphosphatemia. To prevent recurrence, advise the patient to eat foods with low phosphorus content such as vegetables. Obtain dietary consultation if the condition results from chronic renal insufficiency. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), also known as dilutional hyponatremia, is marked by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which disturbs fluid and electrolyte balance. Such disturbances result from the inability to excrete dilute urine, free water retention, extracellular fluid volume expansion, and hyponatremia. SIADH occurs secondary to diseases that affect the osmoreceptors (supraoptic nucleus)\\nof the hypothalamus. The prognosis depends on the underlying disorder and response to treatment. Causes and incidence The most common cause of SIADH (80% of patients) is oat cell carcinoma of the lung, which secretes excessive ADH or vasopressor-like substances. Other neoplastic diseases, such as pancreatic and prostatic cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and thymoma, may also trigger SIADH. Less common causes include: central nervous system disorders: brain tumor or abscess, stroke, head injury, Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 syndrome, and lupus erythematosus pulmonary disorders: pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung abscess, and positive-pressure ventilation drugs: chlorpropamide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, carbamazepine, clofibrate, and morphine miscellaneous conditions: myxedema and psychosis. Complications Water intoxification Cerebral edema Severe hyponatremia Coma Signs and symptoms SIADH may produce weight gain despite anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; muscle weakness; restlessness; and, possibly, coma and seizures. Edema is rare unless water overload exceeds 4 L because much of the free water excess is within cellular boundaries. Diagnosis P A complete medical history revealing positive water balance may suggest SIADH. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum osmolality less than 280 mOsm/kg of water and a serum sodium level below 123 mEq/L confirm the diagnosis (normal urine osmolality is 11/2 times serum values). Supportive laboratory values include high urine sodium secretion (more than 20 mEq/L) without diuretics and high urine osmolality. In addition, diagnostic studies show normal renal function and no evidence of dehydration. Treatment Treatment for SIADH is symptomatic and begins with restricted water intake (500 to 1,000 ml/day). Some patients who continue to have symptoms are given a high-salt, high-protein diet or urea supplements to enhance water excretion. They may also receive demeclocycline or lithium to help block the renal response to ADH. With severe water intoxication, administration of 200 to 300 ml of 5% saline may be necessary to raise the serum sodium level. When possible, treatment should include correction of the underlying cause of SIADH. If\\nSIADH is due to cancer, success in alleviating water retention may be obtained by surgical resection, irradiation, or chemotherapy. Special considerations Closely monitor and record intake and output, vital signs, and daily weight. Watch for hyponatremia. Observe the patient for restlessness, irritability, seizures, heart failure, and unresponsiveness due to hyponatremia and water intoxication. To prevent water intoxication, explain to the patient and his family why he must restrict his intake. Metabolic acidosis Metabolic acidosis is a physiologic state of excess acid accumulation and deficient base bicarbonate produced by an underlying pathologic disorder. Symptoms result from the body's attempts to correct\\nthe acidotic condition through compensatory mechanisms in the lungs, kidneys, and cells. Metabolic acidosis is more prevalent among children, who are vulnerable to acid-base imbalance because their metabolic rates\\nare faster and their ratios of water to total-body weight are lower. Severe or untreated metabolic acidosis can be fatal. Causes and incidence Metabolic acidosis usually results from excessive fat burning in the absence of usable carbohydrates. This can be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or a low-carbohydrate, highfat diet\\u2014all of which produce more keto acids than\\nthe metabolic process can handle. Other causes include: anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism: a decrease in tissue oxygenation or perfusion (as occurs with pump failure\\nafter myocardial infarction, or with pulmonary or hepatic disease, shock, or anemia) forces a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, causing a corresponding rise in lactic acid level renal insufficiency and failure (renal acidosis): underexcretion of metabolized acids or inability to conserve base diarrhea and intestinal malabsorption: loss of sodium bicarbonate from the intestines, causing the bicarbonate buffer system to shift to the acidic side. For example, ureteroenterostomy and Crohn's disease can also induce metabolic acidosis. Less often, metabolic acidosis results from salicylate intoxication (overuse of aspirin), exogenous poisoning, or Addison's disease with an increased excretion of sodium and chloride, and retention of potassium ions. Complications Coma Arrhythmias Cardiac arrest Signs and symptoms In mild acidosis, the underlying disease's symptoms may obscure any direct clinical evidence. Metabolic acidosis typically begins with headache and lethargy, progressing to drowsiness, central nervous system depression, Kussmaul's respirations (as the lungs attempt\\nto compensate by \\u201cblowing off\\u201d carbon dioxide), stupor and, if the condition is severe and goes untreated, coma and death. Associated GI distress usually produces anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and may lead to dehydration. Underlying diabetes mellitus may cause fruity breath from catabolism of fats and excretion of accumulated acetone through the lungs. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Arterial pH below 7.35 confirms metabolic acidosis. In severe acidotic states, pH may fall to 7.10, and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide may be normal or below 34 mm Hg as compensatory mechanisms take hold. Bicarbonate may be below 22 mEq/L. A metabolic panel can help reveal the cause and severity of metabolic acidosis. A complete blood count can be done to help assess\\npossible causes as well. Supportive findings include: urine pH: below 4.5 in the absence of renal disease serum potassium levels: above 5.5 mEq/ L from chemical buffering glucose levels: above 150 mg/dl in diabetes serum ketone bodies: elevated levels in diabetes mellitus serum osmolarity: increased levels, as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic acidosis or dehydration plasma lactic acid: elevated levels in lactic acidosis P anion gap: greater than 14 mEq/L indicating metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, alcohol poisoning). (See Anion gap. ) Treatment In metabolic acidosis, treatment consists of administration of sodium bicarbonate I.V. for severe cases, evaluation and correction of electrolyte imbalances and, ultimately, correction of the underlying cause. For example, in diabetic ketoacidosis, a low-dose continuous I.V. infusion of insulin is recommended. ANION GAP The anion gap is the difference between concentrations of\\nserum cations and anions \\u2014determined by measuring one cation (sodium) and two anions (chloride and bicarbonate). The normal concentration of sodium is 140 mEq/L; of chloride, 102 mEq/L; and of bicarbonate, 26 mEq/L. Thus, the anion gap between measured cations (actually sodium alone) and measured anions is about 12 mEq/L (140 minus 128). Concentrations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium ( unmeasured cations), or proteins, phosphate, sulfate, and organic acids ( unmeasured anions) aren't needed to measure the anion gap. Added together, the concentration of unmeasured cations would be about 11 mEq/L; of unmeasured anions, about 23 mEq/L. Thus, the normal anion gap between unmeasured cations and anions is about 12 mEq/L (23 minus 11)\\u2014plus or minus 2 mEq/L for normal variation. An anion gap over 14 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. It may result from accumulation of excess organic acids or from retention of hydrogen ions,\\nwhich chemically bond with bicarbonate and decrease bicarbonate levels. Special considerations Keep sodium bicarbonate ampules handy for emergency administration. Monitor vital signs, laboratory results, and level of consciousness frequently because changes can occur rapidly. In diabetic acidosis, watch for secondary changes due to hypovolemia, such as decreasing blood pressure. Record intake and output accurately to monitor renal function. Watch for signs of excessive serum potassium\\u2014weakness, flaccid paralysis, and arrhythmias, possibly leading\\nto cardiac arrest. After treatment, check for overcorrection to hypokalemia. Because metabolic acidosis commonly causes\\nvomiting, position the patient to prevent aspiration. Prepare for possible seizures with seizure precautions. Provide good oral hygiene. Use sodium bicarbonate washes to neutralize mouth acids, and lubricate the patient's lips with lemon and glycerin swabs as indicated. PREVENTION Carefully observe patients receiving\\nI.V. therapy or who have intestinal tubes in place as well as those suffering from shock, hyperthyroidism, hepatic disease, circulatory failure, or dehydration. Teach the patient with diabetes how to routinely test urine for glucose and acetone, and encourage strict adherence to insulin or oral hypoglycemic therapy. Metabolic alkalosis A clinical state marked by decreased amounts of acid or increased amounts of base bicarbonate, metabolic alkalosis causes metabolic, respiratory, and renal responses, producing characteristic symptoms (most notably hypoventilation). This condition is always secondary to an underlying cause. With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, prognosis is good; however, untreated metabolic alkalosis may\\nlead to coma and death. P Causes and incidence Metabolic alkalosis results from loss of acid, retention of base, or renal mechanisms associated with decreased serum levels of potassium and chloride. Causes of critical acid loss include vomiting, nasogastric (NG) tube drainage or lavage without adequate electrolyte replacement, fistulas, and the use of steroids and certain diuretics (furosemide, thiazides, and ethacrynic acid). Hyperadrenocorticism is another cause of severe acid loss. Cushing's disease, primary hyperaldosteronism, and Bartter's syndrome, for example, all lead to retention of sodium and chloride, and\\nurinary loss of potassium and hydrogen. Excessive base retention can result from excessive intake\\nof bicarbonate of soda or other antacids (usually for treatment of gastritis or peptic ulcer), excessive intake of absorbable alkali (as in\\nmilk-alkali syndrome, often seen in patients with peptic ulcers), administration of excessive amounts of I.V. fluids with high concentrations of bicarbonate or lactate, or respiratory insufficiency\\u2014all of which cause chronic hypercapnia from high levels of\\nplasma bicarbonate. Complications Coma Atrioventricular arrhythmias Signs and symptoms Clinical features of metabolic alkalosis result from the body's attempt to correct the acid-base imbalance, primarily through hypoventilation. Other manifestations include irritability, picking at bedclothes (carphology), twitching, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (which aggravates alkalosis). Cardiovascular abnormalities (such as atrial tachycardia) and respiratory disturbances (such as cyanosis and apnea) also occur. In the alkalotic patient, diminished peripheral blood flow during repeated blood pressure checks may provoke carpopedal spasm in the hand\\u2014a possible sign of impending tetany (Trousseau's sign). Uncorrected metabolic alkalosis may progress to seizures and coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Blood pH level greater than 7.45 and\\nbicarbonate levels above 29 mEq/L confirm the diagnosis. A partial pressure of carbon dioxide above 45 mm Hg indicates attempts at respiratory compensation. Serum electrolyte studies show low potassium, calcium, and chloride levels. Other characteristic findings include: Urine pH is usually about 7.0. Urinalysis reveals alkalinity after the renal compensatory mechanism begins to excrete bicarbonate. Electrocardiogram may show low T wave, merging with a U wave (secondary to hypocalcemia from metabolic alkalosis), and atrial or sinus tachycardia. Treatment Treatment aims to correct the underlying cause of metabolic alkalosis. Therapy for severe alkalosis may include cautious administration of ammonium chloride I.V. or hydrochloric acid to release\\nhydrogen chloride and restore concentration of extracellular fluid and chloride levels. Potassium chloride and normal saline solution (except in the presence of heart failure) are usually sufficient to replace losses from gastric drainage. Electrolyte replacement with potassium chloride and discontinuing diuretics correct metabolic alkalosis resulting from potent diuretic therapy. Oral or I.V. acetazolamide, which enhances renal bicarbonate excretion, may be prescribed to correct metabolic alkalosis without rapid volume expansion. Because acetazolamide also enhances potassium excretion, potassium may have to be administered before giving\\nthis drug. P Special considerations Structure the care plan around cautious I.V. therapy, keen observation, and strict monitoring of the patient's status. Dilute potassium when giving I.V. containing potassium salts. Monitor the infusion rate to prevent damage to blood vessels; watch for signs of phlebitis. When administering ammonium chloride 0.9%, limit the infusion rate to 1 L in 4 hours; faster administration may cause hemolysis of red blood cells. Avoid overdosage because it may cause overcorrection to metabolic acidosis. Don't give ammonium chloride with signs of hepatic or renal disease; instead, use hydrochloric acid. Watch closely for signs of muscle weakness, tetany, or decreased activity. Monitor vital signs frequently and record intake and output to evaluate respiratory, fluid, and electrolyte status. Remember, respiratory rate usually decreases in an effort to compensate for alkalosis. Hypotension and tachycardia may indicate electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalemia. Observe seizure precautions. PREVENTION To prevent metabolic alkalosis, warn\\npatients against overusing alkaline agents. Irrigate NG tubes with isotonic saline solution instead of plain water to prevent loss of gastric electrolytes. Monitor I.V. fluid concentrations of bicarbonate or lactate. Teach patients with ulcers to recognize signs of milk-alkali\\nsyndrome: a distaste for milk, anorexia, weakness, and lethargy.

              "{'__intro__': \" Introduction Metabolism is the physiologic process that allows cells to transform food into energy and continually rebuild body cells. Metabolism has two phases: catabolism and anabolism. In catabolism, the energyproducing phase of metabolism, the body breaks down large food molecules into smaller ones; in anabolism, the tissue-building phase, the body converts small molecules into larger ones (such as antibodies to keep the body capable of fighting infection). Both phases are accomplished by means of a chemical process using energy. A wide range of nutrients is metabolized to meet the body's needs. (See Essential nutrients and their functions .) ELDER TIP A person's protein, vitamin, and mineral requirements usually remain the same as he ages, although calorie needs decline. Diminished activity may lower energy requirements\\nby almost 200 calories per day for men and women ages 51 to 75, 400 calories per day for women older than age 75, and 500 calories per day for men older than age 75. Carbohydrates: Primary energy source The body gets most of its energy by metabolizing carbohydrates, especially glucose. Glucose catabolism proceeds in three phases: Glycolysis, a series of chemical reactions, converts glucose molecules into pyruvic or lactic acid. The citric acid cycle removes ionized hydrogen atoms from pyruvic acid and produces carbon dioxide. Oxidative phosphorylation traps energy from the hydrogen electrons and combines the hydrogen ions\\nand electrons with oxygen to form water and the common form of biologic\\nenergy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other essential processes in carbohydrate metabolism include glycogenesis— the formation of glycogen, a storage form of glucose— which occurs when cells become saturated with glucose-6-phosphate (an intermediate product of glycolysis); glycogenolysis, the reverse process, which converts glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate in muscle cells and liberates free glucose in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, or “new” glucose formation from protein amino acids or fat glycerols. A complex interplay of hormonal and neural controls regulates glucose metabolism. Hormone secretions of five endocrine glands dominate this regulatory function: Alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete glucagon, which increases the blood glucose level by stimulating\\nphosphorylase activity to accelerate liver glycogenolysis. Beta cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete the glucose-regulating hormone insulin, which assists in glucose\\ntransport across cell membranes and storage of excess glucose as fat. The adrenal medulla, as a physiologic response to stress, secretes epinephrine, which stimulates liver and muscle glycogenolysis to increase the blood glucose level. Corticotropin and glucocorticoids also increase blood glucose levels. Glucocorticoids accelerate gluconeogenesis by promoting the flow of amino acids to the liver, where\\nthey're synthesized into glucose. Human growth hormone (hGH) limits the fat storage and favors fat catabolism; consequently, it inhibits carbohydrate catabolism and thus raises blood glucose levels. P Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormone have mixed effects on carbohydrate metabolism and may raise or lower blood glucose levels. Fats: Catabolism and anabolism The breaking up of triglycerides— lipolysis —yields fatty acids and glycerol. Betaoxidation breaks down fatty acids\\ninto acetyl coenzyme A, which can then enter the citric acid cycle; glycerol can also undergo gluconeogenesis or enter the glycolytic pathways to produce energy. Conversely, lipogenesis is the chemical formation of fat from excess carbohydrates and proteins\\nor from the fatty acids and glycerol products of lipolysis. Adipose tissue is the primary storage site for excess fat and thus is the greatest source of energy reserve. Certain unsaturated fatty acids are necessary for synthesis of vital body compounds. Because the body can't produce these essential fatty acids, they must be provided through diet. Insulin, hGH, catecholamines, corticotropin, and glucocorticoids control fat metabolism in an inverse relationship with carbohydrate metabolism; large amounts of carbohydrates promote fat storage, and deficiency of available carbohydrates promotes fat breakdown for energy needs. ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS Nutrients are required for the body to work properly and avoid disease. Nutrients Functions Carbohydrates ▪ Energy source Fats and essential fatty acids ▪ Energy source; essential for growth, normal skin, and membranes Proteins and amino acids ▪ Synthesis of all body proteins, growth, and tissue maintenance Water-soluble vitamins: ▪ Ascorbic acid (C) ▪ Collagen synthesis, wound healing, antioxidation ▪ Thiamine (B 1 ) ▪ Coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism ▪ Riboflavin (B 2 ) ▪ Coenzyme in energy metabolism ▪ Niacin ▪ Coenzyme in carbohydrate, fat, energy metabolism, and tissue metabolism ▪ Vitamin B 12 ▪ Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid synthesis; erythrocyte formation ▪ Folic acid ▪ Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism; heme and hemoglobin formation; DNA synthesis; lowering homocysteine levels Fats soluble vitamins: ▪ Vitamin A ▪ Vision in dim light, mucosal epithelium integrity, tooth development, endocrine function ▪ Vitamin D ▪ Regulation of calcium and phosphate absorption and metabolism; renal phosphate clearance ▪ Vitamin E ▪ Antioxidation; essential for muscle, liver, and red blood cell integrity ▪ Vitamin K ▪ Blood clotting (catalyzes synthesis of prothrombin by liver) Proteins: Anabolism The primary process in protein metabolism is anabolism. Catabolism is relegated to a supporting role in protein metabolism —a reversal of the roles played by these two processes in carbohydrate and fat metabolisms. By synthesizing proteins— the tissue-building foods—the body derives substances essential for life (such as plasma proteins) and can reproduce, control cell growth, and repair itself. However, when carbohydrates or fats are unavailable as energy sources, or when energy P demands are exceedingly high, protein catabolism converts protein into an available energy source. Protein metabolism consists of many processes, including: Deamination — a\\ncatabolic and energyproducing process occurring in the liver with the splitting off of the amino acid to form ammonia and a keto acid Transamination — anabolic conversion of keto acids to amino acids Urea formation — a catabolic process occurring in the liver, producing urea, the end product of protein catabolism. The male hormone testosterone and hGH stimulate protein anabolism; corticotropin prompts secretion of glucocorticoids, which, in\\nturn, facilitate protein catabolism. Normally, the rate of protein anabolism equals the rate of protein catabolism —a condition known as nitrogen balance (because ingested nitrogen equals nitrogen waste excreted in urine, feces, and sweat). When excessive catabolism causes the amount of nitrogen excreted to exceed the amount ingested, a state of negative nitrogen balance exists—usually the result of starvation and cachexia or surgical stress. Fluid and electrolyte balance A critical component of metabolism is fluid and electrolyte balance. Water is an essential body substance and constitutes almost 60% of an adult's body weight and more than 75% of a neonate's body weight. In both older and obese adults, the ratio of water to body weight drops; children and lean people have a higher proportion of water in their bodies. Body fluids can be classified as intracellular (or cellular) or extracellular. Intracellular fluid constitutes about 40% of\\ntotal body weight and 60% of all body fluid; it contains large quantities of potassium and phosphates but very little sodium and chloride. Conversely, extracellular fluid (ECF) contains mostly sodium and chloride but very little potassium and phosphates. Incorporating interstitial, cerebrospinal, intraocular, and GI fluids and plasma, ECF supplies cells with nutrients and other substances needed for cellular function. The many components of body fluids have the important function\\nof preserving osmotic pressure and acid-base and anion-cation balance. Homeostasis is a stable state—the equilibrium of chemical\\nand physical properties of body fluid. Body fluids contain two kinds of\\ndissolved substances: those that dissociate in solution (electrolytes) and those that don't. For example, glucose, when dissolved in water, doesn't break down into smaller particles; but sodium chloride dissociates in solution into sodium cations (+) and chloride anions (-).\\nThe composition of these electrolytes in body fluids is electrically balanced so the positively charged ions (cations: sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) equal the negatively charged ions (anions: chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, phosphate, proteinate, and carbonic and other organic acids). Although these particles are present in relatively\\nlow concentrations, any deviation from their normal levels can have profound physiologic effects. ELDER TIP Institutionalized older people are at particularly high risk for dehydration because of their diminished thirst perception and any combination of physical, cognitive, speech, mobility, and visual impairment. In homeostasis—an ever-changing but balanced state—water and electrolytes and other solutes move continually between cellular and extracellular compartments. Such motion is made possible by semiper- meable membranes that allow diffusion, filtration, and active transport. Diffusion refers to the movement of particles or molecules from an area of greater concentration to one of lesser concentration. Normally, particles move randomly and constantly until the concentrations within given solutions are equal. Diffusion also depends on permeability, electrical gradient, and pressure gradient. Particles, however, can't diffuse against any of these gradients without energy and\\na carrier substance (active transport). ATP is released from cells to aid particles needing energy to pass through the cell membrane. The diffusion of water from a solution of low concentration to one of high concentration is called osmosis. The pressure that develops when a selectively permeable cell membrane separates solutions of different strengths of concentrations is known as osmotic pressure, expressed in P terms of osmols or milliosmols (mOsm). Osmotic activity is described in terms of osmolality — the osmotic pull exerted by all particles per unit of water, expressed in mOsm/ kg of water—or osmolarity, when expressed in mOsm/L of solution. The normal range of body fluid osmolality is 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. Solutions of 50 mOsm above or below the high and low points of this normal range exert little or no osmotic effect (isosmolality). A solution below 240 mOsm contains a lower particle concentration than plasma (hypoosmolar) while a solution over 340 mOsm has a higher particle concentration than plasma (hyperosmolar). Rapid I.V. administration of isosmolar solutions to patients who are debilitated, are very old or very young, or have cardiac or renal insufficiency could lead to ECF volume overload and induce pulmonary edema and heart failure because particulate concentration is the same as plasma, so fluid shifting into and out of cells will occur. Continuous I.V. administration of hypoosmolar solutions decreases serum osmolality and leads to excess intracellular fluid volume (water intoxication), whereas continuous I.V. administration of hyperosmolar solutions results in intracellular dehydration, increased serum osmolality and, eventually, ECF volume deficit due to excessive urinary excretion. These states occur because of fluid diffusion and the\\ncell's attempt to balance the particulate concentrations inside and outside the cell. Regulation of pH Primarily through the complex chemical regulation of carbonic acid by the lungs and of base bicarbonate by the kidneys, the body maintains the hydrogen ion concentration to keep the ECF pH between\\n7.35 and 7.45. Nutritional deficiency or excess, disease, injury, or metabolic disturbance can interfere with normal homeostatic mechanisms and raise pH (acidosis) or lower it (alkalosis). Assessing homeostasis The goal of metabolism and homeostasis is to maintain the\\ncomplex environment of ECF—the plasma—which nourishes and supports every body cell. This special environment is subject to multiple interlocking influences and readily reflects any disturbance in nutrition, chemical or fluid content, and osmotic pressure. Such disturbances can be detected by various laboratory tests. For example, measurements of albumin, prealbumin, and other blood proteins; electrolyte concentration; enzyme and antibody levels; and urine and blood chemistry levels (lipoproteins, glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, and creatinine-height index) accurately reflect the state of metabolism, homeostasis, and nutrition throughout the body. (See Laboratory tests: Assessing nutritional status, page 546.)\\nResults of such laboratory tests, of course, supplement the information\\nobtained from dietary history and physical examination—which offer gross clinical information about the quality, quantity, and efficiency of metabolic processes. To support clinical information, anthropometry, height-weight ratio, and skin-fold thickness determinations specifically\\ndefine tissue nutritional status. The following measures can help you maintain your patient's homeostasis. Obtain a complete dietary history and nutritional assessment to determine if carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamin, mineral, and water intake are adequate for energy production and for tissue repair and growth. Remember that during periods of rapid tissue synthesis (growth, pregnancy, healing), protein needs increase. Consult a dietitian about any patient who may be malnourished because of malabsorption syndromes, renal or hepatic\\ndisease, clear- liquid diets, or who may possibly receive nothing by mouth for more than 5 days. Planned meals that provide adequate carbohydrates, fats, and protein are necessary for convalescence. Supplementary carbohydrates are often needed to spare protein and achieve a positive nitrogen balance. Accurately record intake and output to assess fluid balance (this includes intake of oral liquids or I.V. solutions, and urine, gastric, and stool output). Weigh the patient daily—at the same time, with the same-type clothing, and on the same scale. Remember, a weight loss of 2.2 lb (1 kg) is equivalent to the loss of 1 L of fluid. P Observe the patient closely for insensible\\nwater or unmeasured fluid losses (such as through diaphoresis). Remember, fluid loss from the skin and lungs (normally 900 ml/ day) can reach as high as 2,000 ml/day from hyperventilation or tachypnea, thus increasing insensible water losses. ELDER TIP Teach elderly patients and others vulnerable to fluid imbalances the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake. LABORATORY TESTS: ASSESSING NUTRITIONAL STATUS Blood and urine tests provide the most precise data about\\nnutritional status, often revealing nutritional problems before they're\\nclinically apparent. The list below explains some common tests and what\\ntheir results mean. Serum vitamins and minerals Vitamin and mineral deficiencies commonly screened for include A, B, B 12 , folic acid, ascorbic acid, beta carotene, riboflavin and, sometimes, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, and other minerals. Serum nutrients Glucose levels help assess suspected diabetes or hypoglycemia. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels help differentiate the\\ntype of hyperlipoproteinemia. Nitrogen balance A negative nitrogen balance indicates inadequate intake of protein or calories. Hemoglobin and hematocrit Decreased levels can occur in protein-calorie malnutrition, iron deficiency, overhydration, hemorrhage, and hemolytic disease; elevated levels in dehydration, polycythemia, and folate and B 12 deficiency. Serum albumin Reduced levels may indicate overhydration or visceral protein depletion because of GI disease, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome. Elevated levels occur in dehydration. Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing One or more positive responses, in 24 to 48 hours, to intradermally injected common recall antigens indicates intact cell-mediated immunity. Negative, delayed, or absent response may indicate protein-calorie malnutrition but may also be seen in patients on steroids or with cancer, as well as patients with shock or sepsis. Creatinine-height index (CHI) This calculated value reflects muscle mass and estimates muscle protein depletion. Reduced CHI may indicate protein-calorie malnutrition or impaired renal function. Serum prealbumin This carrier protein for thyroxine is a sensitive indicator of visceral protein. Total lymphocyte count This provides an indication of immune status. Counts are low in malnutrition and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Recognize I.V. solutions that are hyposmolar, such as 0.45% NaCl (half- normal saline solution). Isosmolar solutions include normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 5% dextrose in 0.2% NaCl, Ringer's solutions, and 5% dextrose in water. (The latter acts like a hypotonic solution because dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving only free water.) Hyperosmolar solutions include 5% dextrose in normal saline solution, 10% dextrose in water, and 5% dextrose in Ringer's lactate solution. P When continuously administering hypoosmolar solutions, watch for signs of water intoxication: headaches,\\nbehavior changes (confusion or disorientation), nausea, vomiting, rising blood pressure, and falling pulse rate. When continuously administering hyperosmolar solutions, be alert for signs of hypovolemia: thirst, dry mucous membranes, slightly falling blood pressure, rising pulse rate and\\nrespirations, low-grade fever (99° F [37.2° C]), and elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and BUN levels. Administer fluid cautiously, especially to\\nthe patient with cardiopulmonary or renal disease, and watch for signs of overhydration: constant and irritating cough, dyspnea, moist crackles, rising central venous pressure, and pitting edema (late sign). When the patient is in an upright position, neck and hand vein engorgement is a sign of fluid overload. ELDER TIP Many older patients take drugs to treat a variety of conditions. Remember that drugs can affect the patient's nutritional status by altering nutrient absorption, metabolism, utilization, or excretion. Likewise, various foods, beverages, and mineral or vitamin supplements can affect the absorption and effectiveness of drugs. Be aware of these potential interactions when evaluating the patient's medication regimen and nutritional status. NUTRITIONAL IMBALANCE Vitamin A deficiency A fat-soluble vitamin absorbed in the GI tract, vitamin A\\nmaintains epithelial tissue and retinal function. Consequently, deficiency of this vitamin may result in night blindness, decreased color adjustment, keratinization of epithelial tissue, and poor bone growth. Healthy adults have adequate vitamin A reserves to last up to a year; children often don't. Causes and incidence Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intake of foods high in vitamin A (liver, kidney, butter, milk, cream, cheese, and fortified margarine) or carotene, a precursor of vitamin A found in dark green leafy vegetables and yellow or orange fruits and vegetables. (Six mg of beta-carotene is equal to 1 mg of vitamin A.) The\\nrecommended daily allowance for vitamin A is 1 mg for adult males and 0.8 mg for adult females. Less common causes include: malabsorption due to celiac disease, sprue, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis, or habitual use of mineral oil as a laxative massive urinary excretion caused by cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, nephritis, or urinary tract infection decreased storage and transport of vitamin A due to hepatic disease. Each year, more than 80,000 people worldwide—mostly children in underdeveloped countries—lose their sight from severe vitamin A deficiency. This condition is rare in the United States, although many disadvantaged children have substandard levels of vitamin A. With therapy, the chance of reversing symptoms of night blindness and\\nmilder conjunctival changes is excellent. When corneal damage is present, emergency treatment is necessary. Complication Corneal damage Signs and symptoms Typically, the first symptom of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (nyctalopia), which usually becomes apparent when the patient enters a dark place or is caught in the glare of oncoming headlights while driving at night. This condition can progress to xerophthalmia, or drying of the P 8 conjunctivas, with development of gray plaques (Bitot's spots); if unchecked, perforation, scarring, and blindness may result. Keratinization of epithelial tissue causes dry, scaly skin; follicular hyperkeratosis; and shrinking and hardening of the mucous membranes, possibly leading to infections of the eyes and the\\nrespiratory or genitourinary tract. An infant with severe vitamin A deficiency shows signs of failure to thrive and apathy, along with dry skin and corneal changes, which can lead to ulceration and rapid destruction of the cornea. Diagnosis Dietary history and typical ocular lesions suggest vitamin A deficiency. Carotene levels less than 40 mcg/dl also suggest vitamin A deficiency, but they vary with seasonal ingestion of fruits and vegetables. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum level of vitamin A that falls below 10 mcg/dl confirms the diagnosis. Levels between 10 and 19 mcg/dl are also considered low but the patient isn't likely to have developed significant symptoms. RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE OF B-COMPLEX VITAMINS Vitamin Men (23 to 50) Women (23 to 50) Infants Children (1 to 10) B 1 * 1.4 mg 1 mg 0.4 mg 0.7 to 1.2 mg B 2 * 1.6 mg 1.2 mg 0.5 mg 0.8 to 1.4 mg Niacin * 18 mg 13 mg 5 to 8 mg 9 to 16 mg B 6 2.2 mg 2 mg 0.4 mg 0.9 to 1.6 mg B 12 3 mcg 3 mcg 0.3 mcg 2 to 3 mcg * requirements per 1,000 kilocalories of dietary intake Treatment Mild conjunctival changes or night blindness requires vitamin A replacement in the form of cod liver oil or halibut liver oil.\\nAcute deficiency requires aqueous vitamin A solution I.M., especially when corneal changes have occurred. Therapy for underlying biliary obstruction consists of administration of bile salts; for pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatin. Dry skin responds well to cream-based or petroleum-based products. In patients with chronic malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and in those with low dietary intake, prevention of vitamin A deficiency requires aqueous I.V. supplements or an oral water-miscible preparation. Special considerations Administer oral vitamin A supplements with\\nor after meals or parenterally, as indicated. Watch for signs of hypercarotenemia (orange coloration of the skin and eyes) and hypervitaminosis A (rash, hair loss, anorexia, transient hydrocephalus, and vomiting in children; bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, diplopia, and irritability in adults). If these signs occur, discontinue supplements and notify the physician immediately. (Hypercarotenemia is relatively harmless; hypervitaminosis A may be toxic.) PREVENTION Because vitamin A deficiency usually\\nresults from dietary insufficiency, provide nutritional counseling. Tell the patient that vitamin A comes from animal sources, such as eggs,\\nmeat, milk, cheese, cream, liver, kidney, and cod and halibut fish oil,\\nbut that healthier choices, such as carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and most dark green, leafy vegetables are good sources of beta- carotene,\\nvitamin A's precursor form. Instruct the patient that the more intense the color of a fruit or vegetable, P the higher its beta-carotene content.\\nProvide referrals to appropriate community agencies if necessary. Vitamin B deficiencies Vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble vitamins essential to normal metabolism, cell growth, and blood formation. (See Recommended daily allowance of B-complex vitamins. ) The most common deficiencies involve thiamine (B 1 ), riboflavin (B 2 ), niacin, pyridoxine (B 6 ), and cobalamin (B 12 ). Causes and incidence Thiamine deficiency results from malabsorption or inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B 1 . It also results from alcoholism, prolonged diarrhea, or from increased requirement, which can occur in pregnancy, lactation, and hyperthyroidism. Beriberi, a serious thiamine- deficiency disease, is most prevalent in Asians, who subsist mainly on diets of unenriched rice and wheat. Although this disease is uncommon in the United States, alcoholics may develop cardiac (wet) beriberi with high-output heart failure, neuropathy, and cerebral disturbances. In times of stress (pregnancy, for example), malnourished young adults may develop beriberi; infantile beriberi may appear in infants on low-protein diets or in those breast-fed by thiamine-deficient mothers. Riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) results from a diet deficient in milk, meat, fish, legumes, and green, leafy vegetables. Alcoholism or prolonged diarrhea may also induce riboflavin deficiency. Exposure of milk to sunlight or treatment of legumes with baking soda can destroy riboflavin. Niacin deficiency, in its advanced form, produces pellagra, which affects the skin, central nervous system (CNS), and GI tract. (See Recognizing pellagra. )\\nAlthough this deficiency is now seldom found in the United States, it was once common among Southerners who subsisted mainly on corn and consumed minimal animal protein. (Corn is low in niacin and in available\\ntryptophan, the amino acid from which the body synthesizes niacin.) Niacin deficiency is still common in parts of Egypt, Romania, Africa, Serbia, and Montenegro, where corn is the dominant staple food. Niacin deficiency can also occur secondary to carcinoid syndrome or Hartnup disease. Pyridoxine deficiency usually results from destruction of\\npyridoxine in infant formulas by autoclaving. A frank deficiency is uncommon in adults, except in patients taking pyridoxine antagonists, such as isoniazid and penicillamine. Cobalamin deficiency most commonly results from an absence of intrinsic factor in gastric secretions, or an absence of receptor sites after ileal resection. Other causes include malabsorption\\nsyndromes associated with sprue, intestinal worm infestation, regional ileitis, and gluten enteropathy, and a diet low in animal protein. RECOGNIZING PELLAGRA This patient with pellagra shows dark, scaly, advanced dermatitis. In advanced niacin deficiency, such dermatitis usually occurs on areas exposed to the sun. Signs and symptoms P Thiamine deficiency causes polyneuritis and, possibly, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. In infants (infantile beriberi), this deficiency produces edema, irritability, abdominal pain, pallor, vomiting, loss of voice and, possibly, seizures.\\nIn wet beriberi, severe edema starts in the legs and moves up through the body; dry beriberi causes multiple neurologic symptoms and an emaciated appearance. Thiamine deficiency may also cause cardiomegaly, palpitations, tachycardia, dyspnea, and circulatory collapse. Constipation and indigestion are common; ataxia, nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia are also possible. Riboflavin deficiency characteristically causes cheilosis\\n(cracking of the lips and corners of the mouth), sore throat, and glossitis. It may also cause seborrheic dermatitis in the nasolabial folds, scrotum, and vulva and, possibly, generalized dermatitis involving the arms, legs, and trunk. This deficiency can also affect the eyes, producing burning, itching, light sensitivity, tearing, and vascularization of the corneas. Late-stage riboflavin deficiency causes neuropathy, mild anemia and, in children, growth retardation. Niacin deficiency in its early stages produces fatigue, anorexia, muscle weakness, headache, indigestion, mild skin eruptions, weight loss, and backache. In advanced stages (pellagra), it produces dark, scaly dermatitis, especially on exposed body parts, that makes the\\npatient appear to be severely sunburned. The mouth, tongue, and lips become red and sore, which may interfere with eating. Common GI symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Associated CNS aberrations— confusion, disorientation, and neuritis—may become severe enough to induce hallucinations and paranoia. Because of this triad of symptoms, pellagra is sometimes called a “3-D” syndrome—dementia, dermatitis, and diarrhea. If not reversed by therapeutic doses of niacin, pellagra can be fatal. Pyridoxine deficiency in infants causes a wide range of symptoms: dermatitis, occasional cheilosis or glossitis unresponsive to riboflavin therapy, abdominal pain, vomiting, ataxia, and seizures. This\\ndeficiency can also lead to CNS disturbances. Cobalamin deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which produces anorexia, weight loss, abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, and glossitis; peripheral neuropathy; and, possibly, ataxia, spasticity, and hyperreflexia. Diagnosis The following values confirm vitamin B deficiency. Thiamine deficiency —commonly\\nmeasured as micrograms per deciliter in a 24-hour urine collection. Deficiency levels are age-related: 1 to 3 years, less than 120; 4 to 6 years, less than 85; 7 to 9 years, less than 70; 10 to12 years, less than 60; 13 to 15 years, less than 50; adults, less than 27; pregnant women, less than 23 (second trimester), less than 21 (third trimester). Riboflavin deficiency —measured\\nas micrograms per gram of creatinine in a 24-hour urine collection. Deficiency levels are age-related: 1 to 3 years, less than 150; 4 to 6 years, less than 100; 7 to 9 years, less than 85; 10 to 15 years, less than 70; adults, less than 27; pregnant women, less than 39 (second trimester); less than 30 (third trimester). Niacin deficiency —measured\\nby Nmethyl nicotinamide in a 24-hour urine collection as micrograms per\\ngram of creatinine. Deficiency levels are: adults, less than 0.5; first\\ntrimester of pregnancy, less than 0.5; second trimester, less than 0.6;\\nthird trimester, less than 0.8. Pyridoxine deficiency —xanthurenic\\nacid more than 50 mg/day in 24- hour urine collection after administration of 10 g of L-tryptophan; decreased levels of serum and red blood cell transaminases; reduced excretion of pyridoxic acid in urine. Cobalamin deficiency —cobalamin\\nserum levels less than 150 pg/ml. Tests to discover the deficiency's cause include gastric analysis and hemoglobin studies. In addition, the Schilling test measures absorption of radioactive cobalamin with and without intrinsic factor. Treatment Diet and supplementary vitamins can correct or prevent vitamin B deficiencies, as follows. Thiamine deficiency —a\\nhigh-protein diet, with adequate calorie intake, possibly supplemented by B-complex vitamins for early P symptoms. Thiamine-rich foods include pork, peas, wheat bran, oatmeal, and liver. Alcoholic beriberi may require thiamine supplements or thiamine hydrochloride as part of a B-complex concentrate. Riboflavin deficiency —supplemental\\nriboflavin in patients with intractable diarrhea or increased need for riboflavin related to growth, pregnancy, lactation, or wound healing. Good sources of riboflavin are meats, enriched flour, milk and dairy products, green, leafy vegetables, eggs, and cereal. Acute riboflavin deficiency requires daily oral doses of riboflavin alone or with other B-complex vitamins. Riboflavin phosphate can also be administered I.V. or I.M. Niacin deficiency —supplemental\\nB-complex vitamins and dietary enrichment in patients at risk because of marginal diets or alcoholism. Meats, fish, peanuts, brewer's yeast, enriched breads, and cereals are rich in niacin; milk and eggs, in tryptophan. Confirmed niacin deficiency requires daily doses of niacinamide orally or I.V. Pyridoxine deficiency —prophylactic\\npyridoxine therapy in infants and in children with a seizure disorder; supplemental B-complex vitamins in patients with anorexia, malabsorption, or those taking isoniazid or penicillamine. Some women who take hormonal contraceptives may have to supplement their diets with\\npyridoxine. Confirmed pyridoxine deficiencies require oral or parenteral pyridoxine. Children with convulsive seizures stemming from metabolic dysfunction may require daily doses of 200 to 600 mg pyridoxine. Cobalamin deficiency —parenteral\\ncobalamin in patients with reduced gastric secretion of hydrochloric acid, lack of intrinsic factor, some malabsorption syndromes, or ileum resections. Strict vegetarians may have to supplement their diets with oral vitamin B 12 . Depending on the deficiency's severity, supplementary cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamine is usually given parenterally for 5 to 10 days, followed by monthly or daily vitamin B 12 supplements. Special considerations An accurate dietary history provides a baseline for effective dietary counseling. Identify and observe patients who are at risk for vitamin B deficiencies —alcoholics, the elderly, pregnant women,\\noral hormonal contraceptive users (vitamins B 6 and B 12 ), and people on limited diets. Administer prescribed supplements. Make sure patients understand how important it is that they adhere strictly to their prescribed treatment for the rest of their lives. Watch for adverse effects from large doses of niacinamide, such as a flushed sensation or hot flashes, in patients with niacin deficiency. Remember, prolonged intake of niacin can cause hepatic dysfunction. Caution patients with Parkinson's disease receiving pyridoxine that this drug can impair response to levodopa therapy. Explain all tests and procedures. Reassure\\npatients that, with treatment, the prognosis is good. Refer patients to\\nappropriate assistance agencies if their diets are inadequate due to adverse socioeconomic conditions. PREVENTION Encourage the patient to follow a well-balanced diet. Vitamin B 12 injections can prevent anemia after surgeries known to cause B 12 deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency leads to scurvy or inadequate production of collagen, an extracellular substance that binds\\nthe cells of the teeth, bones, and capillaries. It's essential for wound healing and burn recovery. Vitamin C is also an important factor in metabolizing such amino acids as tyrosine and phenylalanine. It also acts as a reductant, activating enzymes in the body, as well as converting folic acid into useful components. Severe vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy, evident by hemorrhagic tendencies and abnormal osteoid and dentin formation. P Causes and incidence This deficiency's primary cause is a diet lacking in vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, spinach, and berries. Because the body can't store this water-soluble vitamin in large amounts, the supply needs to be replenished daily. Other causes include: destruction of vitamin C in foods by overexposure to air or by overcooking excessive ingestion of vitamin C during pregnancy, which causes the neonate to require large amounts of the vitamin after birth marginal intake of vitamin C during periods of physiologic stress— caused by infectious disease, for example—which can deplete tissue saturation of vitamin C. Historically common among sailors and others deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for long periods of time, vitamin C deficiency is uncommon today in the United States, except in alcoholics,\\npeople on restricted-residue diets, and infants weaned from breast milk\\nto cow's milk without a vitamin C supplement. SCURVY'S EFFECT ON GUMS AND LEGS In adults, scurvy causes swollen or bleeding gums and loose teeth. It also causes follicular hyperkeratosis, usually on the legs. Complication Scurvy Signs and symptoms Clinical features of vitamin C deficiency appear as capillaries become increasingly fragile. In an adult, it produces petechiae, ecchymoses, follicular hyperkeratosis (especially on the buttocks and legs), anemia, anorexia, limb and joint pain (especially in\\nthe knees), pallor, weakness, swollen or bleeding gums, loose teeth, lethargy, insomnia, poor wound healing, and ocular hemorrhages in the bulbar conjunctivae. (See Scurvy's effect on gums and legs .)\\nVitamin C deficiency can also cause beading, fractures of the costochondral junctions of the ribs or epiphysis, and such psychological\\ndisturbances as irritability, depression, hysteria, and hypochondriasis. In a child, vitamin C deficiency produces tender, painful\\nswelling in the legs, causing the child to lie with his legs partially flexed. Other P symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum ascorbic acid levels less than\\n0.2 mg/ dl and white blood cell ascorbic acid levels less than 30 mg/dl\\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. Dietary history revealing an inadequate intake of ascorbic acid suggests vitamin C deficiency. A capillary fragility test may be performed on the patient's forearm with a blood pressure cuff; it's positive if more than 10 petechiae form after 5 minutes of pressure. Treatment Because scurvy may be fatal, treatment begins immediately\\nto restore adequate vitamin C intake with daily doses of 100 to 200 mg synthetic vitamin C or orange juice in mild disease and with doses as high as 500 mg/day in severe disease. Symptoms usually subside in 2 to 3\\ndays; hemorrhages and bone disorders, in 2 to 3 weeks. Special considerations Administer ascorbic acid orally or by slow\\nI.V. infusion, as indicated. Avoid moving the patient unnecessarily to avoid irritating painful joints and muscles. Encourage him to drink orange juice. Explain the importance of supplemental ascorbic acid. Counsel the patient and his family about good dietary sources of vitamin C. Advise against taking too much vitamin C. Explain that excessive doses of ascorbic acid may cause nausea, diarrhea, and renal calculi formation and may also interfere with anticoagulant therapy. PREVENTION Patients unable or unwilling to consume foods rich in vitamin C or those facing surgery should take daily supplements of ascorbic acid. The recommended daily allowance is 60 mg/day. Vitamin C supplementation may also prevent this deficiency in\\nrecently weaned infants or those drinking formula not fortified with vitamin C. Vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D deficiency, commonly called rickets, causes failure of normal bone calcification, which occurs through several mechanisms: decreased calcium and phosphorus (the major components of bone) from the intestines, increased excretion of calcium from renal tubules, and increased parathyroid secretion resulting in increased release of calcium from the bone. The deficiency results in rickets in infants and young children and osteomalacia in adults. With treatment, the prognosis is good. However, in rickets, bone deformities usually persist, while in osteomalacia, such deformities may disappear. Causes and incidence Vitamin D deficiency results from inadequate dietary intake of preformed vitamin D, malabsorption of vitamin D, or too little\\nexposure to sunlight. Once a common childhood disease, rickets is now rare in the United States but occasionally appears in breast-fed infants who don't receive a vitamin D supplement or in infants receiving a formula with a nonfortified milk base. This deficiency may also occur in overcrowded urban areas in which smog limits sunlight penetration. Incidence is highest in black children who, because of their skin color,\\nabsorb less sunlight. (Solar ultraviolet rays irradiate 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of vitamin D, to form calciferol.) Osteomalacia, also uncommon in the United States, is most\\nprevalent in Asia, among young multiparas who eat a cereal diet and have minimal exposure to sunlight. Other causes include: vitamin D-resistant rickets (refractory rickets, familial hypophosphatemia) from an inherited impairment of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (from vitamin D insensitivity) conditions that lower absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, such as chronic pancreatitis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, gastric or small bowel resections, fistulas, colitis, and biliary obstruction hepatic or renal disease, which interferes\\nwith the formation of hydroxylated calciferol, necessary to initiate the formation of a calcium-binding protein in intestinal absorption sites malfunctioning parathyroid gland (decreased secretion of parathyroid hormone), which contributes to calcium deficiency (normally, vitamin D controls calcium and phosphorus absorption through the intestine) and interferes with activation of vitamin D in the kidneys. Complications Chronic skeletal pain Skeletal deformities Skeletal fractures Signs and symptoms Early indications of vitamin D deficiency are profuse sweating, restlessness, and irritability. Chronic deficiency induces numerous bone malformations due to softening of the bones: bowlegs, knock-knees, rachitic rosary (beading of ends of ribs), enlargement of wrists and ankles, pigeon breast, delayed closing of the fontanels, softening of the skull, and bulging of the forehead. (See Recognizing bowlegs, page 554.) Other rachitic features are poorly developed muscles (potbelly) and infantile tetany. Bone deformities may cause difficulty in walking and in climbing stairs, spontaneous multiple fractures, and lower back and leg pain. Diagnosis Physical examination, dietary history, and laboratory tests establish the diagnosis. Test results that suggest vitamin D deficiency include plasma calcium serum levels less than 7.5 mg/dl, serum inorganic phosphorus levels less than 3 mg/dl, serum citrate P levels less than 2.5 mg/dl, and alkaline phosphatase levels less than 4 Bodansky units/dl. RECOGNIZING BOWLEGS This infant with rickets shows characteristic bowing of the legs. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS X-rays confirm the diagnosis by showing characteristic bone deformities and abnormalities such as Looser's zones (pseudofractures). Treatment For osteomalacia and rickets—except when caused by malabsorption— treatment consists of oral doses of vitamin D or sources such as fish, liver, and processed milk. Exposure to sunlight is encouraged. For rickets refractory to vitamin D or in rickets accompanied by hepatic or renal disease, treatment includes 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1, 25- dihydroxycholecalciferol, or a synthetic analogue of active vitamin D. Replacement of deficient calcium\\nand phosphorus also helps to eliminate most symptoms of rickets. Positioning or bracing may be used to reduce or prevent deformities; some skeletal deformities may require corrective surgery. Special considerations Obtain a dietary history to assess the patient's current vitamin D intake. Encourage him to eat foods high in vitamin D—fortified milk, fish liver oils, herring, liver, and egg yolks—and get sufficient sun exposure. If deficiency is due to socioeconomic conditions, refer the patient to appropriate community agencies. If the patient must take vitamin D for a prolonged period, tell him to watch for signs of vitamin D toxicity (headache, nausea, constipation and, after prolonged use, renal calculi). PREVENTION Administer supplementary aqueous preparations of vitamin D for chronic fat malabsorption, hydroxylated cholecalciferol for refractory rickets, and supplemental vitamin D for breast-fed infants. Consider genetic counseling for a patient with a family history of inherited disorders that can cause rickets. Vitamin E deficiency Vitamin E (tocopherol) appears to act primarily as an antioxidant, preventing intracellular oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty\\nacids and other lipids. It protects body tissue from damage caused by unstable substances called free radicals, which can harm cells, tissues,\\nand organs and are believed to be one of the causes of aging's degenerative process. Vitamin E is also important in the formation of red blood cells (RBCs) and helps the body to use vitamin K. Vitamin E deficiency usually manifests as hemolytic anemia in low-birth-weight or premature neonates. With treatment, prognosis is good. Causes and incidence P Vitamin E deficiency in infants usually results from consuming formulas high in polyunsaturated fatty acids that are fortified with iron but not vitamin E. Such formulas increase the need for antioxidant vitamin E because the iron supplement catalyzes the oxidation of RBC lipids. A neonate has low tissue concentrations of vitamin E to begin with because only a small amount passes through the placenta; the mother retains most of it. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, deficiency develops in conditions associated with fat malabsorption, such as kwashiorkor, celiac disease, or cystic fibrosis. These conditions may induce megaloblastic or hemolytic anemia and creatinuria, all of which are reversible with vitamin E administration. Vitamin E deficiency is uncommon in adults but is possible in people whose diets are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which increase vitamin E requirements, and in people with vitamin E malabsorption, which impairs RBC survival. Complication Hemolytic anemia Signs and symptoms Vitamin E deficiency is difficult to recognize, but its early symptoms include edema and skin lesions in infants and muscle weakness or intermittent claudication in adults. In premature neonates, vitamin E deficiency produces hemolytic anemia, thrombocythemia, and erythematous papular skin eruption, followed by desquamation. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Dietary and medical histories suggest vitamin E deficiency. Serum alphatocopherol levels below 0.5 mg/dl in adults and below 0.2 mg/dl in infants confirm it. Creatinuria, increased creatine kinase levels, hemolytic anemia, and an elevated platelet count generally support the diagnosis. Treatment Replacement of vitamin E with a water-soluble supplement, either oral or parenteral, is the only appropriate treatment. Special considerations As indicated, prevent deficiency by providing vitamin E supplements for low-birth-weight neonates receiving formulas not fortified with vitamin E and for adults with vitamin E malabsorption. Many commercial multivitamin supplements are easily absorbed by patients with vitamin E malabsorption. If vitamin E deficiency is related to socioeconomic conditions, refer the patient to appropriate community agencies. PREVENTION Inform new mothers who plan to breast-feed that human milk provides adequate vitamin E. Encourage adult patients to eat foods high in vitamin E; good sources include vegetable oils (corn, safflower, soybean, cottonseed); whole grains; dark green, leafy vegetables; nuts; and legumes. Tell them that heavy consumption of\\npolyunsaturated fatty acids increases the need for vitamin E. Vitamin K deficiency Deficiency of vitamin K, an element necessary for formation of prothrombin and other clotting factors in the liver, produces abnormal bleeding. If the deficiency is corrected, the prognosis is excellent. Causes and incidence P Vitamin K deficiency is common among neonates in the first few days postpartum due to poor placental transfer of vitamin K and inadequate production of vitamin Kproducing intestinal flora. Its other causes include prolonged use of drugs, such as the anticoagulant warfarin and antibiotics that destroy normal intestinal bacteria; decreased flow of bile to the small intestine from obstruction of the bile duct or bile fistula; malabsorption of vitamin K due to sprue, pellagra, bowel resection, ileitis, or ulcerative colitis; chronic hepatic disease, with impaired response of hepatic ribosomes to vitamin K; and cystic fibrosis, with fat malabsorption. Vitamin K deficiency seldom results from insufficient dietary intake of this vitamin. Signs and symptoms The cardinal sign of vitamin K deficiency is an abnormal bleeding tendency, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time (PT); these\\nsigns disappear with vitamin K administration. Without treatment, bleeding may be severe and, possibly, fatal. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A PT that's 25% longer than the normal range of 10 to 20 seconds, measured by the Quick method, confirms the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency after other causes of prolonged PT (such as anticoagulant therapy or hepatic disease) have been ruled out. The international normalized ratio (normal value, 0.8 to 1.2) is the more common method of assessing PT adequacy. Repetition of testing in 24 hours (and regularly during treatment) monitors the therapy's effectiveness. Treatment Administration of vitamin K I.V. or I.M. corrects abnormal bleeding tendencies. Special considerations PREVENTION Administer vitamin K to neonates and patients with fat malabsorption or with prolonged diarrhea from colitis, ileitis, or long-term antibiotic drug therapy. If the deficiency has\\na dietary cause, help the patient and his family plan a diet that includes important sources of vitamin K, such as cauliflower, tomatoes, cheese, egg yolks, liver, and green, leafy vegetables. Warn against self-medication with or overuse of antibiotics, because these drugs destroy the intestinal bacteria needed to generate significant amounts of vitamin K. Hypervitaminoses A and D Hypervitaminosis A is excessive accumulation of vitamin A; hypervitaminosis D, of vitamin D. Although these are toxic conditions, they usually respond well to treatment. They're most prevalent in infants and children, usually as a result of accidental or misguided overdosage by parents. A related, benign condition called hypercarotenemia results from excessive consumption of carotene, a chemical precursor of vitamin A. Causes and incidence Vitamins A and D are fat-soluble vitamins that accumulate\\nin the body because they aren't dissolved and excreted in the urine. (See Important facts about vitamins A and D .)\\nIn most cases, hypervitaminoses A and D result from ingestion of excessive amounts of supplemental vitamin preparations. A single dose of\\nmore than 1 million units of vitamin A can cause acute toxicity; daily doses of 15,000 to 25,000 units taken over weeks or months have proven toxic in infants and children. For the same dose to produce toxicity in adults, ingestion over years is necessary. Doses of 100,000 international units of vitamin D daily for several P months can cause toxicity in adults. Individuals who are at risk include those with hyperparathyroidism, kidney disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or histoplasmosis. PEDIATRIC TIP In infants, giving 40,000 international units daily of vitamin D can cause toxicity in 1 to 4 months. Hypervitaminosis A may occur in patients receiving pharmacologic doses of vitamin A for dermatologic disorders. Hypervitaminosis D may occur in patients receiving high doses of the vitamin as treatment for hypoparathyroidism, rickets, and the osteodystrophy of chronic renal failure, and in infants who consume fortified milk and cereals plus a vitamin supplement. Concentrations of vitamin A in common foods are generally too low to pose a danger of excessive intake. However, a benign condition called hypercarotenemia results from excessive consumption of vegetables high in carotene (a protovitamin that the body converts into vitamin A), such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and dark green, leafy vegetables. Signs and symptoms Chronic hypervitaminosis A produces anorexia, irritability, headache, hair loss, malaise, itching, vertigo, bone pain,\\nbone fragility, and dry, peeling skin. It may also cause hepatosplenomegaly and emotional lability. Acute toxicity may also produce transient hydrocephalus and vomiting. (Hypercarotenemia produces\\nyellow or orange skin coloration.) Hypervitaminosis D causes anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia. Because vitamin D promotes calcium absorption, severe toxicity can lead to hypercalcemia, including calcification of soft tissues, as in the heart, aorta, and renal tubules. Lethargy, confusion, and coma may accompany severe hypercalcemia. IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT VITAMINS A AND D This table illustrates good sources of vitamins A and D, their recommended daily allowances, and the actions they produce. Vitamin Sources Recommended dietary allowance Action Vitamin A ▪ Carrots; sweet potatoes; dark green, leafy vegetables; butter; margarine; liver; egg yolk ▪ Children: 1,400 international units ▪ Adults: 4,000 to 5,000 international units ▪ Lactating women: 6,000 international units ▪ Produces retinal pigment and maintains epithelial tissue Vitamin D ▪ Ultraviolet light; fortified foods (especially milk) ▪ 400 international units daily ▪ Promotes absorption and regulates metabolism of calcium and phosphorus Diagnosis A thorough patient history suggests hypervitaminosis A. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum vitamin A level (over 90 mcg/dl) confirms hypervitaminosis A. Patient history and an elevated serum calcium level (over 10.5 mcg/dl) suggest hypervitaminosis D. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum vitamin D level confirms hypervitaminosis D. In children, X-rays showing calcification of tendons, ligaments, and subperiosteal tissues support this diagnosis. P CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An elevated serum carotene level (over 250 mcg/dl) confirms hypercarotenemia. Treatment Withholding vitamin supplements usually corrects hypervitaminosis A quickly and hypervitaminosis D gradually. Hypercalcemia may persist for weeks or months after the patient stops taking vitamin D. Treatment for severe hypervitaminosis D may include glucocorticoids to control hypercalcemia and prevent renal damage. In the acute stage, diuretics or other emergency measures for severe hypercalcemia may be necessary. Hypercarotenemia responds well to a diet\\nfree of high- carotene foods. Special considerations Keep the patient comfortable, and reassure him that symptoms will subside after he stops taking the vitamin. Make sure the patient or the parents of a child with these conditions understand that vitamins aren't innocuous. Explain the hazards associated with excessive vitamin intake. Point out that vitamin A and D requirements can easily be met with a diet containing dark green, leafy vegetables; fruits; and fortified milk or milk products. PREVENTION Monitor serum vitamin A levels in patients receiving doses above the recommended daily allowance and serum\\ncalcium levels in patients receiving pharmacologic doses of vitamin D. Iodine deficiency Iodine deficiency is the absence of sufficient levels of iodine to satisfy daily metabolic requirements. Because the thyroid gland uses most of the body's iodine stores, iodine deficiency is apt to cause hypothyroidism and thyroid gland hypertrophy (endemic goiter). Other effects of deficiency range from dental caries to cretinism in neonates born to iodine-deficient mothers. Iodine deficiency is most common in pregnant or lactating women due to their exaggerated metabolic need for this element. Iodine deficiency responds readily to treatment with iodine supplements. Causes and incidence Iodine deficiency usually results from insufficient intake of dietary sources of iodine, such as iodized table salt, seafood, and dark green, leafy vegetables. (Normal iodine requirements range from 35 mcg/ day for infants to 150 mcg/day for lactating women; the average adult needs 1 mcg/kg of body weight.) Iodine deficiency may also result from an increase in metabolic demands during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence. Complications Hypothyroidism Goiter Signs and symptoms Clinical features of iodine deficiency depend on the degree of hypothyroidism that develops (in addition to the development of a goiter). Mild deficiency may produce only mild, nonspecific symptoms, such as lassitude, fatigue, and loss of motivation. Severe deficiency usually generates the typically overt and unmistakable features of hypothyroidism: bradycardia; decreased pulse pressure and cardiac output; weakness; hoarseness; dry, flaky, inelastic skin; puffy face; thick tongue; delayed relaxation phase in deep tendon reflexes; poor memory; hearing loss; chills; anorexia; and nystagmus. In women, iodine deficiency may also cause menorrhagia and amenorrhea. Cretinism—hypothyroidism that develops in utero or in early infancy—is characterized by failure to thrive, neonatal jaundice, and hypothermia. By age 3 to 6 months, the infant may display spastic diplegia and signs and symptoms similar to those seen in infants with Down syndrome. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Abnormal laboratory test results include low thyroxine (T 4 ) levels with high radioactive iodine ( 131 I) uptake, low 24-hour urine iodine levels, and high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Radioiodine uptake test traces 131 I in the thyroid 24 hours after administration; triiodothyronine- resin or T 4 -resin uptake test shows values 25% below normal. Treatment Severe iodine deficiency requires administration of iodine supplements (potassium iodide [SSKI]). Mild deficiency may be corrected by increasing iodine intake through the use of iodized table salt and consumption of iodine-rich foods (seafood and green, leafy vegetables). Special considerations Administer SSKI preparation in milk or juice to reduce gastric irritation and mask its metallic taste. To prevent tooth discoloration, tell the patient to drink the solution through a straw. Store the solution in a light-resistant container. PREVENTION Recommend the use of iodized salt and consumption of iodine-rich foods for high-risk patients—especially adolescents and pregnant or lactating women. Advise pregnant women\\nthat severe iodine deficiency may produce cretinism in neonates, and instruct them to watch for early signs of iodine deficiency, such as P fatigue, lassitude, weakness, and decreased mental function. Zinc deficiency Zinc, an essential trace element that's present in the bones, teeth, hair, skin, testes, liver, and muscles, is also a vital component of many enzymes. Zinc promotes synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid and, ultimately, protein, and maintains normal blood concentrations of vitamin A by mobilizing it from the liver. The prognosis is good with correction of the deficiency. Causes and incidence Zinc deficiency usually results from excessive intake of foods (containing iron, calcium, vitamin D, and the fiber and phytates in cereals) that bind zinc to form insoluble chelates that prevent its absorption. Occasionally, it results from blood loss due to parasitism and low intake of foods containing zinc. Alcohol and corticosteroids increase renal excretion of zinc. Zinc deficiency is most common in people from underdeveloped countries, especially in the Middle East. Children are most susceptible to this deficiency during periods of rapid growth. Signs and symptoms Zinc deficiency produces hepatosplenomegaly, sparse hair growth, soft and misshapen nails, poor wound healing, anorexia, hypogeusesthesia (decreased taste acuity), dysgeusia (unpleasant taste),\\nhyposmia (decreased odor acuity), dysosmia (unpleasant odor in nasopharynx), severe iron deficiency anemia, bone deformities and, when chronic, hypogonadism, dwarfism, and hyperpigmentation. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Fasting serum zinc levels below 70 mcg/ dl confirm zinc deficiency and indicate altered phosphate metabolism, imbalance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and decreased pancreatic enzyme levels. Treatment Treatment consists of correcting the deficiency's underlying cause and administering zinc supplements, as necessary. Special considerations Advise the patient to take zinc supplements with milk or meals to prevent gastric distress and vomiting. PREVENTION Encourage a balanced diet that includes seafood, oatmeal, bran, meat, eggs, nuts, and dry yeast and the correct use of calcium and iron supplements. Obesity Obesity is an excess of body fat, generally 20% above ideal body weight. The prognosis for correction of obesity is poor: Fewer than 30% of patients succeed in losing 20 lb (9 kg), and only half\\nof these maintain the loss over a prolonged period. Causes and incidence Obesity results from excessive calorie intake and inadequate expenditure of energy. Theories to explain this condition include hypothalamic dysfunction of hunger and satiety centers, genetic predisposition, abnormal absorption of nutrients, and impaired action of GI and growth hormones and of hormonal regulators such as insulin. An inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the prevalence of obesity has been documented, especially in women. Obesity in parents increases the probability of obesity in children, from genetic or environmental factors, such as activity levels and learned patterns of P eating. Psychological factors, such as stress or emotional eating, may also contribute to obesity. Rates of obesity are climbing, and the percentage of children and adolescents who are obese has doubled in the last 20 years. Complications Respiratory difficulties Hypertension Cardiovascular disease Diabetes mellitus Renal disease Gallbladder disease Psychosocial difficulties Premature death Diagnosis Observation and comparison of height and weight to a standard table indicate obesity. Measurement of the thickness of subcutaneous fat folds with calipers provides an approximation of total body fat. Although this measurement is reliable and isn't subject to daily fluctuations, it has little meaning for the patient in monitoring subsequent weight loss. Treatment Successful management of obesity must decrease the patient's daily calorie intake while increasing his activity level. Effective treatment must be based on a balanced, low-calorie diet that eliminates foods high in fat or sugar. Lifelong maintenance of these improved eating and exercise patterns is necessary to achieve long-term benefits. The popular low-carbohydrate diets offer no long-term advantage; rapid early weight reduction is due to loss of water, not fat. These and other crash or fad diets have the overwhelming drawback that they don't teach the patient long-term modification of eating patterns and often lead to the “yo-yo syndrome”—episodes of repeated weight loss followed by weight gain. This can be more detrimental than the obesity itself because of the severe stress it can place on the body. Total fasting is an effective method of rapid weight reduction but requires close monitoring and supervision to minimize risks of ketonemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension, and loss of lean\\nbody mass. Prolonged fasting and very-low-calorie diets have been associated with sudden death, possibly resulting from cardiac arrhythmias caused by electrolyte abnormalities. These methods also neglect patient re- education, which is necessary for long-term weight maintenance. Treatment may also include hypnosis and behavior modification techniques, which promote fundamental changes in eating habits and activity patterns. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial for some patients, because weight reduction may lead to depression or even psychosis. Antidepressants are also helpful in weight\\nloss. Amphetamines and amphetamine congeners have been used to enhance compliance with a prescribed diet by temporarily suppressing the appetite and creating a feeling of well-being. However, because their value in long-term weight control is questionable, and they have significant potential for dependence and abuse, their use is generally avoided. If these drugs are used at all, they should be prescribed only for short-term therapy and should be monitored carefully. As a last resort, morbid obesity, which is indicated by body weight that's 50% to 100% higher than ideal, body weight that's 100\\npounds higher than ideal, or a body mass index greater than 39, may be treated surgically with a variety of restrictive procedures. The two most popular bariatric surgeries are vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass surgery. These procedures decrease the volume of food that the stomach can hold or bypass the stomach, with the goal of producing satiety with small intake. Bypassing the stomach also induces diarrhea when concentrated sweets are ingested. These techniques cause fewer complications than jejunoileal bypass, which induces a permanent malabsorption syndrome. Extended liquid diets are necessary adjuncts to surgery. Psychological counseling is also recommended. Special considerations P Obtain an accurate diet history to identify the patient's eating patterns and the importance of food to his\\nlifestyle. Ask the patient to keep a careful record of what, where, and\\nwhen he eats to help identify situations that normally provoke overeating. Explain the prescribed diet carefully, and encourage compliance to improve health status. To increase calorie expenditure, promote increased physical activity, including an exercise program. Recommend varying activity levels according to the patient's general condition and\\ncardiovascular status. Watch carefully for signs of dependence or\\nabuse if the patient is taking appetitesuppressing drugs; also watch for adverse effects, such as insomnia, excitability, dry mouth, and GI disturbances. Teach the grossly obese patient the importance of good skin care to prevent breakdown in moist skin folds. Recommend the regular use of powder to keep skin dry. The patient having gastric bypass surgery should receive psychological and nutritional counseling before and after\\nthe surgery to assist with dietary and lifestyle changes. PREVENTION Teach parents to avoid overfeeding their infants and to familiarize themselves with actual nutritional needs and optimum growth rates. Discourage parents from using food to reward or console their children, from emphasizing the importance of “clean plates,” and from allowing eating to prevent hunger rather than to satisfy it. Encourage physical activity and exercise, especially in children and young adults, to establish lifelong patterns. Suggest low-calorie snacks such as raw vegetables. Protein-calorie malnutrition One of the most prevalent and serious depletion disorders, protein- calorie malnutrition (PCM) occurs as marasmus (protein-calorie deficiency), characterized by growth failure and wasting, and as kwashiorkor (protein deficiency), characterized by tissue edema and damage. Both forms vary from mild to severe and may be fatal, depending on the accompanying stress (particularly sepsis or injury) and duration of deprivation. PCM increases the risk of death from pneumonia, chickenpox, or measles. Causes and incidence Both kwashiorkor (edematous PCM) and marasmus (nonedematous PCM) are common in underdeveloped countries and in areas in which dietary amino acid content is insufficient to satisfy growth requirements. Kwashiorkor typically occurs at about age 1, after infants\\nare weaned from breast milk to a protein-deficient diet of starchy gruels or sugar water, but it can develop at any time during the formative years. Marasmus affects infants ages 6 to 18 months as a result of breast- feeding failure, or a debilitating condition such as chronic diarrhea. In industrialized countries, PCM may occur secondary to chronic metabolic disease that decreases protein and calorie intake or absorption, or trauma that increases protein and calorie requirements. ELDER TIP In the United States, PCM is estimated to occur to some extent in 50% of elderly people in nursing homes. Those who aren't allowed anything by mouth for an extended period are at high risk of developing PCM. Conditions that increase protein-calorie requirements include severe burns and injuries,\\nsystemic infections, and cancer (accounts for the largest group of hospitalized patients with PCM). Conditions that cause defective utilization of nutrients include malabsorption syndrome, short-bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. Signs and symptoms Children with chronic PCM are small for their chronological age and tend to be physically inactive, mentally apathetic, and susceptible to frequent infections. Anorexia and diarrhea\\nare common. P In acute PCM, children are small, gaunt, and emaciated, with no adipose tissue. Skin is dry and “baggy,” and hair is sparse and dull brown or reddish-yellow. Temperature is low; pulse rate and respirations are slowed. Such children are weak, irritable, and usually hungry, although they may have anorexia, with nausea and vomiting. Unlike marasmus, chronic kwashiorkor allows the patient to grow in height, but adipose tissue diminishes as fat metabolizes to meet energy demands. Edema often masks severe muscle wasting; dry, peeling skin and hepatomegaly are common. Patients with secondary PCM show signs similar to marasmus, primarily loss of adipose tissue and lean body mass, lethargy, and edema. Severe secondary PCM may cause loss\\nof immunocompetence. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Clinical appearance, dietary history, and anthropometry confirm PCM. If the patient doesn't suffer from fluid retention, weight change over time is the best index of nutritional status. The following factors support the diagnosis: height and weight less than 80% of standard for the patient's age and sex, and below-normal arm circumference and triceps skinfold serum albumin level less than 2.8 g/dl (normal: 3.3 to 4.3 g/dl) urinary creatinine (24-hour) level used to\\nshow lean body mass status by relating creatinine excretion to height and ideal body weight, to yield creatinine-height index. Treatment The aim of treatment is to provide sufficient proteins, calories, and other nutrients for nutritional rehabilitation and maintenance. When treating severe PCM, restoring fluid and electrolyte balance parentally is the initial concern. A patient who shows normal absorption may receive enteral nutrition after anorexia has subsided. When possible, the preferred treatment is oral feeding. Foods are introduced slowly. Carbohydrates are given first to supply energy, and then high-quality protein foods, especially milk, and protein-calorie supplements, are given. A patient who's unwilling or unable to eat may require supplementary feedings through a nasogastric tube or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which is given through a central venous catheter because of its higher osmolality. Peripheral parenteral nutrition, which has a lower osmolality than TPN and can be given through a peripheral I.V. line, is an alternative to TPN, but it's given\\nless commonly. Accompanying infection must also be treated, preferably with antibiotics that don't inhibit protein synthesis. Cautious realimentation is essential to prevent complications from overloading the compromised metabolic system. Special considerations Encourage the patient with PCM to consume as much nutritious food and beverage as possible. (It's often helpful to\\n“cheer him on” as he eats.) Assist the patient with eating if necessary. Cooperate closely with the dietitian to monitor intake, and provide acceptable meals and snacks. If TPN is necessary, observe strict sterile technique when handling catheters, tubes, and solutions and during dressing changes. PREVENTION Watch for PCM in patients who have been hospitalized for a prolonged period, have had no oral intake for several days, or have cachectic disease. To help eradicate PCM\\nin developing countries, encourage prolonged breast-feeding, educate mothers about their children's needs, and provide supplementary foods, as needed. ELDER TIP P If the older patient is anorectic, consider asking family members and other visitors to bring in special foods from home that may improve the patient's appetite. In addition, encouraging the family to collaborate on feeding a dependent patient can\\nhelp promote his recovery, enhance his feelings of well-being, and stimulate him to eat more. METABOLIC DISORDERS Galactosemia Galactosemia is any disorder of galactose metabolism. It produces symptoms ranging from cataracts and liver damage to mental retardation and occurs in two forms: classic galactosemia and galactokinase-deficiency galactosemia. Although a galactose-free diet relieves most symptoms, galactosemia-induced mental impairment is irreversible; some residual vision impairment may also persist. Causes and incidence Both forms of galactosemia are inherited as autosomal recessive defects and occur in about 1 in 60,000 births in the United States. Up to 1.25% of the population is heterozygous for the classic galactosemia gene. Classic galactosemia results from a defect in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase. (See Metabolic pathway in galactosemia .) Galactokinasedeficiency galactosemia, the rarer form of this disorder, stems from a deficiency of the enzyme galactokinase. In both forms of galactosemia, the inability to normally metabolize the sugar galactose (which is mainly formed by digestion of the disaccharide lactose that's present in milk) causes galactose accumulation. Complications Ovarian dysfunction Cataracts Abnormal speech Cognitive impairment Motor delay Growth retardation Signs and symptoms In children who are homozygous for the classic galactosemia gene, signs are evident at birth or begin within a few days\\nafter milk ingestion, and include failure to thrive, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other clinical effects include liver damage (which causes jaundice, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, and ascites), splenomegaly, galactosuria, proteinuria, and aminoaciduria. Cataracts may also be present at birth or develop later. Pseudotumor cerebri may occur. Continued ingestion of galactose- or lactose-containing foods may cause mental retardation, malnourishment, progressive hepatic failure, and death—from the stillunknown process of galactose metabolites accumulating in body tissues. Although treatment may prevent\\nmental impairment, galactosemia can produce a short attention span, difficulty with spatial and mathematical relationships, and apathetic, withdrawn behavior. Cataracts may be the only sign of galactokinase deficiency, resulting from the accumulation of galactitol, a metabolic by-product of galactose, in the lens. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase in red blood cells (RBCs) confirms classic galactosemia; decreased RBC levels of galactokinase confirm galactokinase deficiency. Prenatal diagnosis may be made by direct measurement of galactose-1- phosphate uridyl transferase. Related laboratory results include increased galactose levels in blood (normal value in children is less than 20 mg/dl) and urine (must use galactose oxidase to avoid confusion with other reducing\\nsugars). Galactose measurements in blood and urine must be interpreted carefully because some children who consume large amounts of milk have elevated plasma galactose concentrations and galactosuria but aren't galactosemic. Also, neonates excrete galactose in their urine for about a\\nweek after birth; premature infants, even longer. METABOLIC PATHWAY IN GALACTOSEMIA Other test results include: P DIET FOR GALACTOSEMIA A patient with galactosemia must follow a lactose-free diet. It's important for him to carefully read food labels to avoid milk\\nand milk products, including dry milk products. He may eat these foods: fish and animal products (except brains and mussels) fresh fruits and vegetables (except peas and lima beans) only bread and rolls made from cracked wheat. He should avoid these foods: dairy products puddings, cookies, cakes, pies food coloring instant potatoes canned and frozen foods (if lactose is listed as an ingredient). liver biopsy—typical acinar formation liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase levels)—elevated urinalysis—albumin in urine ophthalmoscopy—punctate lesions in the fetal lens nucleus (with treatment, cataracts regress) amniocentesis—prenatal diagnosis of galactosemia (recommended for heterozygous and homozygous parents). Treatment Elimination of galactose and lactose from the diet causes\\nmost effects to subside. The infant is fed soy formula, meat-base formula, protein hydrolysate formula, or another lactose-free formula. The infant gains weight; liver anomalies, nausea, vomiting, galactosemia, proteinuria, and aminoaciduria disappear; and cataracts regress. As the child grows, a balanced, galactose-free diet must be maintained. A pregnant woman who's heterozygous or homozygous for galactosemia should also follow a galactose-restricted diet. Such a diet\\nsupports normal growth and development and may delay symptoms in the neonate. Special considerations To eliminate galactose and lactose from an\\ninfant's diet, replace cow's milk formula or breast milk with a meat-base or soybean formula. Teach the parents about dietary restrictions and stress the importance of compliance. (See Diet for galactosemia .) Warn them to read medication labels carefully and avoid giving any medication that contains lactose fillers. If the child has a learning disability, help parents secure educational assistance. Refer parents who want to have other children for genetic counseling. In some states, screening of\\nall neonates for galactosemia is required by law. Instruct the parents to contact support groups, such as Parents of Galactosemic Children, for further information and support if appropriate. Glycogen storage diseases Glycogen storage diseases consist of at least eight distinct errors of metabolism, all inherited, that alter the synthesis or degradation of glycogen, the form in which glucose is stored in the body. Normally, muscle and liver cells store glycogen. Muscle glycogen is used in muscle contraction; liver glycogen can be converted into free\\nglucose, which can then diffuse out of the liver cells to increase blood glucose levels. Glycogen storage diseases manifest as dysfunctions\\nof the liver, heart, or musculoskeletal system. Symptoms vary from mild\\nand easily controlled hypoglycemia to severe organ involvement that may\\nlead to heart failure and respiratory failure. Causes and incidence P Almost all glycogen storage diseases (Types I through V and Type VII) are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits. The transmission mode of Type VI is unknown; Type VIII may be an X-linked trait. The most common glycogen storage disease is Type I—von Gierke's, or hepatorenal glycogen storage disease—which results from a deficiency of the liver enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. This enzyme converts glucose- 6-phosphate into free glucose and is necessary for the release of stored glycogen and glucose into the bloodstream, to relieve hypoglycemia. Infants may die of acidosis before age 2; if they survive past this age, with proper treatment, they\\nmay grow normally and live to adulthood, with only minimal hepatomegaly. However, there's a danger of adenomatous liver nodules, which may be premalignant. Complications Heat intolerance Easy bruising Slowed growth Incomplete sexual development Hepatic ademonas Multiple organ failure Signs and symptoms Primary clinical features of the liver glycogen storage diseases (Types I, III, IV, VI, and VIII) are hepatomegaly and rapid onset of hypoglycemia and ketosis when food is withheld. Symptoms of the\\nmuscle glycogen storage diseases (Types II, V, and VII) include poor muscle tone; Type II may result in death from heart failure. (See Rare forms of glycogen storage disease, pages 566 and 567.) In addition, Type I may produce these symptoms: infants—acidosis, hyperlipidemia, GI bleeding, coma children—low resistance to infection and, without proper treatment, short stature adolescents—gouty arthritis and nephropathy; chronic tophaceous gout; bleeding (especially epistaxis); small superficial vessels visible in skin due to impaired platelet function; fat deposits in cheeks, buttocks, and subcutaneous tissues; poor muscle tone; enlarged kidneys; xanthomas over extensor surfaces of arms and legs; steatorrhea; multiple, bilateral, yellow lesions in fundi; and osteoporosis, probably secondary to negative calcium balance.\\nCorrect treatment of glycogen storage disease should prevent all of these effects. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Liver biopsy confirms the diagnosis by showing normal glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase enzyme activities but reduced or absent glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Glycogen structure is normal but amounts are elevated. Spectroscopy may be used to show abnormal muscle metabolism with the use of magnetic resonance imaging in specialized centers. Laboratory studies of plasma demonstrate low glucose levels but high levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and uric acid. Serum analysis reveals high pyruvic acid levels and high lactic acid levels. Prenatal diagnoses are available for\\nTypes II, III, and IV. Injection of glucagon or epinephrine increases pyruvic and lactic acid levels but doesn't increase blood glucose levels. Glucose tolerance test curve typically shows depletional\\nhypoglycemia and reduced insulin output. Intrauterine diagnosis is possible. Treatment For Type I, treatment aims to maintain glucose homeostasis and prevent secondary consequences of hypoglycemia through frequent feedings and constant nocturnal nasogastric (NG) drip with Polycose, dextrose, or P Vivonex. Treatment includes a low-fat diet, with normal amounts of protein and calories; carbohydrates should contain glucose or glucose polymers only. Therapy for Type III includes frequent feedings and a high-protein diet. Type IV requires a high-protein, high-calorie diet; bed rest; diuretics; sodium restriction; and paracentesis, if necessary,\\nto relieve ascites. Types V and VII require no treatment except avoidance of strenuous exercise. No treatment is necessary for Types VI and VIII; no effective treatment exists for Type II. Special considerations When managing Type I disease: Advise the patient or his parents to include carbohydrate foods containing mainly starch in his diet and to sweeten foods with glucose only. Before discharge, teach the patient or his\\nfamily member how to pass an NG tube, use a pump with alarm capacity, monitor blood glucose levels with glucose reagent strips, and recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia. RARE FORMS OF GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Type Clinical features Diagnostic test results II (Pompe's) Absence of alpha-1,4- glucosidase (acid maltase) ▪ Infants: cardiomegaly, profound hypotonia and, occasionally, endocardial fibroelastosis (usually fatal before age 1 due to cardiac or respiratory\\nfailure) ▪ Some infants and young children: muscle weakness and wasting, variable organ involvement (slower ▪ Muscle biopsy: increased concentration of glycogen with normal structure; alpha- 1,4-glucosidase deficiency ▪ Electrocardiogram (in infants): large QRS complexes in all leads; inverted T waves; shortened PR interval ▪ Electromyography (in adults): muscle fiber progression, usually fatal by age 19) ▪ Adults: muscle weakness without organomegaly (slowly progressive but not fatal) irritability; myotonic discharges ▪ Amniocentesis: alpha-1,4- glucosidase deficiency ▪ Placenta or umbilical cord examination: alpha-1,4- glucosidase deficiency III  (Cori's) Absence of debranching enzyme (amylo-1,6- glucosidase) ( Note: predominant cause of glycogen storage disease in Israel) ▪ Young children: massive hepatomegaly, which may disappear by puberty; growth retardation; moderate splenomegaly; hypoglycemia ▪ Adults: progressive myopathy ▪ Occasionally, moderate cardiomegaly, cirrhosis, muscle wasting, hypoglycemia ▪ Liver biopsy: deficient debranching activity; increased glycogen concentration ▪ Laboratory tests (in children only): elevated aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels; increased erythrocyte glycogen levels IV (Andersen's) Deficiency of branching enzyme (amylo-1,4-1,6- transglucosidase) ( Note: extremely rare) ▪ Infants: hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, muscle hypotonia; usually fatal before age 2 from progressive cirrhosis ▪ Liver biopsy: deficient branching enzyme activity; glycogen molecule has longer outer branches V (McArdle's) Deficiency of muscle phosphorylase ▪ Children: mild or no symptoms ▪ Adults: muscle cramps and pain during strenuous exercise, possibly resulting in myoglobinuria and renal failure ▪ Older patients: significant muscle weakness and wasting ▪ Serum lactate: no increase in venous levels in sample drawn from extremity after ischemic exercise ▪ Muscle biopsy: lack of phosphorylase activity; increased glycogen content VI (Hers') P Possible deficiency of hepatic phosphorylase ▪ Mild symptoms (similar to those of Type I), requiring no treatment ▪ Liver biopsy: decreased phosphorylase b activity, increased glycogen concentration VII Deficiency of muscle phosphofructokinase ▪ Muscle cramps during strenuous exercise, resulting in myoglobinuria and possible renal failure ▪ Reticulocytosis ▪ Serum lactate: no increase in venous levels in sample drawn from extremity after ischemic exercise ▪ Muscle biopsy: deficient phosphofructokinase; marked rise in glycogen concentration ▪ Blood studies: low erythrocyte phosphofructokinase activity; reduced half-life of red blood cells VIII Deficiency of hepatic phosphorylase kinase ▪ Mild hepatomegaly ▪ Mild hypoglycemia ▪ Liver biopsy: deficient phosphorylase b kinase activity; increased glycogen concentration ▪ Blood study: deficient phosphorylase b kinase in leukocytes Watch for and report signs of infection (fever, chills, myalgia) and of hepatic encephalopathy (mental confusion, stupor, asterixis, coma) due to increased blood ammonia levels. When managing other types, do the following. Type II: Explain test procedures, such as electromyography and EEG, thoroughly. P Type III: Instruct the patient to eat a high-protein diet (eggs, nuts, fish, meat, poultry, and cheese). Type IV: Watch\\nfor signs of hepatic failure (nausea, vomiting, irregular bowel function, clay-colored stools, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, edema, and changes in mental status,\\nprogressing to coma). When caring for patients with Types II, III, and IV glycogen storage disease, offer the patient and his parents reassurance and emotional support. Recommend and arrange for genetic counseling, if appropriate. Types V through VIII: Care for these patients is minimal. Explain the disorder to the patient\\nand his family, and help them accept the limitations imposed by his particular type of glycogen storage disease. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is an abnormally low glucose level in the bloodstream. It occurs when glucose burns up too rapidly, when the glucose release rate falls behind tissue demands, or when excessive insulin enters the bloodstream. Hypoglycemia is classified as reactive or fasting. Reactive hypoglycemia results from the reaction to the disposition of meals or the administration of excessive insulin. Fasting hypoglycemia causes discomfort during long periods of abstinence from food, for example, in the early morning before breakfast. Although hypoglycemia is\\na specific endocrine imbalance, its symptoms are often vague and depend\\non how quickly the patient's glucose levels drop. If not corrected, severe hypoglycemia may result in coma and irreversible brain damage. Causes and incidence Reactive hypoglycemia may take several forms. In a diabetic patient, it may result from administration of too much insulin or, less commonly, too much oral antidiabetic medication. In a mildly diabetic patient (or one in the early stages of diabetes mellitus), reactive hypoglycemia may result from delayed and excessive insulin production after carbohydrate ingestion. Similarly, a nondiabetic patient may develop reactive hypoglycemia from a sharp increase in insulin output after a meal. Sometimes called postprandial hypoglycemia, this type of reactive hypoglycemia usually disappears when the patient eats something sweet. In some patients, reactive hypoglycemia has no known cause (idiopathic reactive) or may result from gastric dumping syndrome and from impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting hypoglycemia usually results from an excess of insulin or insulin- like substance or from a decrease in counterregulatory hormones. It can be exogenous, resulting from such external factors as alcohol or drug ingestion, or endogenous, resulting from organic problems. Endogenous hypoglycemia may result from tumors or liver disease. Insulinomas, small islet cell tumors in the pancreas, secrete excessive amounts of insulin, which inhibit hepatic glucose production. They're generally benign (in 90% of patients). Extrapancreatic tumors, though uncommon, can also cause hypoglycemia by increasing glucose utilization and inhibiting glucose output. Such tumors occur primarily in the mesenchyma, liver, adrenal cortex, GI system, and lymphatic system. They may be benign or malignant. Among nonendo-crine causes of fasting hypoglycemia are severe liver diseases, including hepatitis, cancer, cirrhosis, and liver congestion associated with heart failure. All of these conditions reduce the uptake and release of glycogen from the liver. Some endocrine causes include adrenocortical insufficiency, which contributes to hypoglycemia by reducing the production of cortisol\\nand cortisone needed for gluconeogenesis; and pituitary insufficiency, which reduces corticotropin and growth hormone levels. Hypoglycemia is at least as common in neonates and children as it is in adults and affects 1 out of 1,000 people. Usually, infants develop hypoglycemia because of an increased number of cells per\\nunit of body weight and because of increased demands on stored liver glycogen to support respirations, thermoregulation, and muscular activity. In full- term neonates, hypoglycemia may occur 24 to 72 hours after birth and is usually transient. In neonates who are premature or small for gestational age, onset of hypoglycemia is much more rapid (it can occur as soon as 6 hours after birth) because of their small, immature livers, which produce much less glycogen. Maternal disorders that can produce hypoglycemia in neonates within 24 hours after birth include diabetes mellitus, toxemia, erythroblastosis, and glycogen storage disease. Complication Permanent brain damage Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia include fatigue, malaise, nervousness, irritability, trembling, tension, headache, hunger, cold sweats, and rapid heart rate. These same clinical\\neffects usually characterize fasting hypoglycemia. In addition, fasting\\nhypoglycemia may also cause central nervous system (CNS) disturbances; for example, blurry or double vision, confusion, motor weakness, hemiplegia, seizures, or coma. In infants and children, signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are vague. A neonate's refusal to feed may be the primary clue to underlying hypoglycemia. Associated CNS effects include tremors,\\ntwitching, weak or high-pitched cry, sweating, limpness, seizures, and coma. Diagnosis A blood glucose monitor or glucose reagent strips provide\\nquick screening methods for determining the blood glucose level. A reading less than 50 mg/dl indicates the need for a venous blood sample.\\n(See Diagnosing hypoglycemia. ) CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Laboratory testing confirms the diagnosis by showing decreased blood glucose levels. The following values indicate hypoglycemia: Full-term infants – less than 30 mg/dl before feeding – less than 40 mg/dl after feeding Preterm infants – less than 20 mg/dl before feeding – less than 30 mg/dl after feeding P DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPOGLYCEMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist with treatment of the patient with hypoglycemia. P Children and adults – less than 40 mg/dl before meal – less than 50 mg/dl after meal. In addition, a 5-hour glucose tolerance test may be administered to provoke reactive hypoglycemia. Following a 12-hour fast,\\nlaboratory testing to detect plasma insulin and plasma glucose levels may identify fasting hypoglycemia. Treatment Effective treatment of reactive hypoglycemia requires dietary modification to help delay glucose absorption and gastric emptying. Usually this includes small, frequent meals; ingestion of complex carbohydrates, fiber, and fat; and avoidance of simple sugars, alcohol, and fruit drinks. The patient may also receive anticholinergic drugs to slow gastric emptying and intestinal motility and to inhibit vagal stimulation of insulin release. For fasting hypoglycemia, surgery and drug therapy are usually required. In patients with insulinoma, tumor removal is the treatment of choice. Drug therapy may include nondiuretic thiazides such\\nas diazoxide to inhibit insulin secretion; streptozocin; and hormones, such as glucocorticoids and long-acting glycogen. Therapy for neonates who have hypoglycemia or who are at risk of developing it includes preventive measures. A hypertonic solution of 10% dextrose, calculated at 5 to 10 ml/kg of body weight administered I.V. over 10 minutes and followed by 4 to 8 mg/ kg/minute for maintenance, should correct a severe hypoglycemic state in neonates.\\nTo reduce the chance of hypoglycemia in high-risk neonates, they should\\nreceive feedings (either breast milk or a solution of 5% to 10% glucose\\nand water) as soon after birth as possible. Special considerations Watch for and report signs of hypoglycemia, such as poor feeding, in high-risk neonates. Monitor infusion of hypertonic glucose in the neonate to avoid hyperglycemia, circulatory overload, and cellular dehydration. Terminate glucose solutions gradually to prevent hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinemia. Explain the purpose and procedure for any diagnostic tests. Collect blood samples at the appropriate times, as ordered. Monitor the effects of drug therapy and watch for the development of any adverse effects. Teach the patient or his family which foods to include in his diet (complex carbohydrates, fiber, fat) and which foods to avoid (simple sugars, alcohol). Refer the patient and his\\nfamily for dietary counseling as appropriate. Hereditary fructose intolerance Hereditary fructose intolerance is an inability to metabolize fructose. After fructose is eliminated from the diet, symptoms subside within weeks. Older children and adults with hereditary\\nfructose intolerance have normal intelligence and apparently normal liver and kidney function. Causes and incidence Transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, hereditary fructose intolerance results from a deficiency in the enzyme fructose-1- phosphate aldolase. The enzyme operates at only 1% to 10% of its normal biological activity, thus preventing rapid uptake of fructose\\nby the liver after ingestion of fruit or foods containing cane sugar. In some European countries, hereditary fructose intolerance may have an incidence as high as 1 in 20,000 people. Signs and symptoms Typically, clinical features of hereditary fructose intolerance appear shortly after dietary introduction of foods containing fructose or sucrose. Symptoms are more severe in infants than\\nin older people and include hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, pallor, excessive sweating, P cyanosis, and tremor. In neonates and young children, continuous ingestion of foods containing fructose may result in failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, hepatomegaly, vomiting, dehydration, hypophosphatemia, albuminuria, aminoaciduria, seizures, coma, febrile episodes, substernal\\npain, and anemia. Diagnosis A dietary history often suggests hereditary fructose intolerance. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A fructose tolerance test (using glucose oxidase or paper chromatography to measure glucose levels) usually confirms the diagnosis. However, liver biopsy showing a deficiency in fructose-1-phosphate aldolase may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Supportive values may include decreased serum inorganic phosphorus levels. Urine studies may show fructosuria and albuminuria. Treatment Treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance consists of exclusion of fructose and sucrose (cane sugar or table sugar) from the diet. Otherwise, treatment is supportive as the patient's progress is monitored. Special considerations Tell the patient to avoid fruits containing fructose and vegetables containing sucrose (sugar beets, sweet potatoes, and peas), because sucrose is digested to glucose and fructose in the intestine. Fruits containing the least amount of fructose include strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, oranges, and grapefruits; others low in fructose are cherries, pears, bananas, grapes, and apples. Refer the patient and his family for genetic and dietary counseling as appropriate. Hyperlipoproteinemia Hyperlipoproteinemia occurs as five distinct metabolic disorders, all of which may be inherited. Types I and III are transmitted as autosomal recessive traits; Types II, IV, and V are transmitted as autosomal dominant traits. (See Types of hyperlipoproteinemia, page 572. )\\nAbout one in five persons with elevated plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels has hyperlipoproteinemia. It's marked by increased plasma concentrations of one or more lipoproteins. Hyperlipoproteinemia may also occur secondary to other conditions, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, or renal disease. Causes and incidence This disorder affects lipid transport in serum and produces varied clinical changes, from relatively mild symptoms that can\\nbe corrected by dietary management to potentially fatal pancreatitis. Complications Coronary artery disease Pancreatitis Signs and symptoms Type I: recurrent attacks of severe abdominal pain similar to pancreatitis, usually preceded by fat intake; abdominal spasm, rigidity, or rebound tenderness; hepatosplenomegaly, with liver or spleen tenderness; papular\\nor eruptive xanthomas (pinkish-yellow cutaneous deposits of fat) over pressure points and extensor surfaces; lipemia retinalis (reddish-white retinal vessels); malaise; anorexia; and fever Type II: tendinous xanthomas (firm masses) on the Achilles tendons and tendons of\\nthe hands and feet, tuberous xanthomas, xanthelasma, juvenile corneal arcus (opaque ring surrounding the corneal periphery), accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary artery disease, and recurrent polyarthritis and tenosynovitis P Type III: peripheral vascular disease manifested by claudication or tuboeruptive xanthomas (soft, inflamed, pedunculated lesions) over the elbows and knees; palmar xanthomas on the hands, particularly the fingertips; premature atherosclerosis Type IV: predisposition to atherosclerosis and early coronary artery disease, exacerbated by excessive calorie intake, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension Type V: abdominal pain (most common), pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, eruptive xanthomas on extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, lipemia retinalis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Treatment The first goal is to identify and treat any underlying problem such as diabetes. If no underlying problem exists, the primary treatment of Types II, III, and IV is dietary management, especially restriction of cholesterol intake, possibly supplemented by drug therapy (cholestyramine, clofibrate, niacin) to lower plasma triglyceride or cholesterol level when diet alone is ineffective. TYPES OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA Type Causes and incidence Diagnostic findings I (Frederickson's hyperlipoproteinemia, fat- induced hyperlipemia, idiopathic familial) ▪ Deficient or abnormal lipoprotein lipase, resulting in decreased or absent post- heparin lipolytic activity ▪ Relatively rare ▪ Present at birth ▪\\nChylomicrons (very-low- density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein), in plasma 14 hours or more\\nafter last meal ▪ Highly elevated serum chylomicrons and triglyceride levels; slightly elevated serum cholesterol levels ▪ Lower serum lipoprotein lipase levels ▪ Leukocytosis II (familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia, essential familial hypercholesterolemia) ▪\\nDeficient cell surface receptor that regulates LDL degradation and cholesterol synthesis, resulting in increased levels of plasma LDL over joints and pressure points ▪ Onset between ages 10 and 30 ▪ Increased plasma concentrations of LDL ▪ Increased serum LDL and cholesterol levels ▪ Amniocentesis shows increased LDL levels III (familial broadbeta disease, dysbetalipoproteinemia, remnant removal disease, xanthoma tuberosum) ▪ Unknown underlying defect results in deficient conversion of triglyceriderich VLDL to LDL ▪ Uncommon; usually occurs after age 20 but can occur earlier in men ▪ Abnormal serum beta- lipoprotein ▪ Elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels ▪ Slightly elevated glucose tolerance ▪ Hyperuricemia IV (endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia) ▪ Usually occurs secondary to obesity, alcoholism, diabetes, or emotional disorders ▪ Relatively common, especially in middle-age men ▪ Elevated VLDL levels ▪ Abnormal levels of triglycerides in plasma; variable increase in serum ▪ Normal or slightly elevated serum cholesterol levels ▪ Mildly abnormal glucose tolerance ▪ Family history ▪ Early coronary artery disease V P (mixed hypertriglyceridemia, mixed hyperlipidemia) ▪ Defective triglyceride clearance causes pancreatitis; usually secondary to another disorder, such as obesity or nephrosis ▪ Uncommon; onset usually occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood ▪ Chylomicrons in plasma ▪ Elevated plasma VLDL levels ▪ Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels Type I hyperlipoproteinemia requires long-term weight reduction, with fat intake restricted to less than 20 g/day. A 20- to 40-g/day medium- chain triglyceride diet may be ordered to supplement calorie intake. The patient should also avoid alcoholic beverages, to decrease plasma triglyceride levels. The prognosis is good with treatment; without treatment, death can result from pancreatitis. For Type II, dietary management to restore normal lipid levels and decrease the risk of atherosclerosis includes restriction of cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg/ day for adults and less than 150\\nmg/day for children; triglycerides must be restricted to less than 100 mg/day for children and adults. Diet should also be high in polyunsaturated fats. In familial hypercholesterolemia, nicotinic acid with a bile acid usually normalizes low-density lipoprotein levels. For severely affected children, a portacaval shunt is a last resort to reduce plasma cholesterol levels. The prognosis remains poor regardless of treatment; in homozygotes, myocardial infarction usually causes death\\nbefore age 30. For Type III, dietary management includes restriction of cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg/day; carbohydrates must also be restricted, while polyunsaturated fats are increased. Clofibrate and niacin help lower blood lipid levels. Weight reduction is helpful. With strict adherence to prescribed diet, the prognosis is good. For Type IV, weight reduction may normalize blood lipid levels without additional treatment. Long-term dietary management includes restricted cholesterol intake, increased polyunsaturated fats, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages. Clofibrate and niacin may lower plasma lipid levels. The prognosis remains uncertain, however, because of predisposition to premature coronary artery disease. The most effective treatment for Type V is weight reduction and long- term maintenance of a low-fat diet. Alcoholic beverages must be avoided. Niacin, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, and a 20- to\\n40-g/day medium- chain triglyceride diet may prove helpful. The prognosis is uncertain because of the risk of pancreatitis. Increased fat intake may cause recurrent bouts of illness, possibly leading to pseudocyst formation, hemorrhage, and death. USING BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS Before giving the patient a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, to lower cholesterol levels, make certain he isn't taking a drug whose absorption is affected by bile acid sequestrants. For example, bile acid sequestrants decrease the absorption of diuretics\\nsuch as chlorothiazide. Other drugs affected besides diuretics include: beta-adrenergic blockers digitoxin fat-soluble vitamins folic acid thiazides thyroxine warfarin. Special considerations Nursing care for hyperlipoproteinemia emphasizes careful monitoring for adverse drug effects and teaching the importance of long-term dietary management. Administer cholestyramine before meals or before bedtime. This drug must not be given with other medications. (See Using bile acid sequestrants .)\\nWatch for adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, steatorrhea, rashes, and hyperchloremic acidosis. Also watch for malabsorption of other medications and fat-soluble vitamins. P 4 Give clofibrate as ordered. Watch for adverse effects, such as cholelithiasis, cardiac arrhythmias, intermittent claudication, thromboembolism, nausea, weight gain (from fluid retention), and myositis. ALERT Don't administer niacin to patients with active peptic ulcers or hepatic disease. Use with caution in patients with diabetes. In other patients, watch for adverse effects, such as flushing, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, and exacerbation of inactive peptic ulcers. Urge the patient to adhere to the ordered diet (usually 1,000 to 1,500 calories/day) and to avoid excess sugar and\\nalcoholic beverages, to minimize his intake of saturated fats (higher in meats, coconut oil), and to increase his intake of polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oils). Instruct the patient, for the 2 weeks preceding serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride tests, to maintain a steady weight and to adhere strictly to the prescribed diet. He should also fast for 12 hours preceding the test. Instruct women with elevated serum lipid levels to avoid hormonal contraceptives or drugs that contain estrogen. Gaucher's disease Gaucher's disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, causes an abnormal accumulation of glucocerebrosides in reticuloendothelial cells. It occurs in three forms: Type I (adult); Type II (infantile); and Type III (juvenile). Type II can prove fatal within 9 months of onset, usually from pulmonary involvement. Causes and incidence Gaucher's disease results from an autosomal recessive inheritance, which causes decreased activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency leads to an accumulation of glucosylceramide in the storage compartments (lysosomes)\\nof certain body cells. Glucosylceramide buildup occurs in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow, eventually leading to decreased production of red blood cells (anemia) and thinning of the bones (osteopenia). There are three forms of Gaucher's disease, classified by\\nage of onset and the presence or absence of neurologic involvement. Type I, characterized by lack of neurologic involvement, is the most common form affecting both children and adults and is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, affecting anywhere from 1 of 500 to 1,000 births. Type II usually presents in infancy with severe neurologic involvement, resulting in seizures and central nervous system damage. Type II also presents with spleen and bone marrow damage. Type III typically has mild neurologic involvement and runs a slower, more favorable course. The incidence of Types II and III is 1 of 50,000 to 100,000 births. The juvenile form can begin in childhood, typically in the teenage years, and cause spleen, bone marrow, and neurologic damage. Complications Neurologic impairment Portal hypertension Pathological fractures Anemia Respiratory failure (Type II) Signs and symptoms The key signs of all types of Gaucher's disease are hepatosplenomegaly and bone lesions. In Type I, bone lesions lead to thinning of cortices, pathologic fractures, collapsed hip joints and, eventually, vertebral compression. Severe episodic pain may develop in the legs, arms, and back but usually not until adolescence. (The adult form of Gaucher's disease is generally diagnosed while the patient is in\\nhis teens; the word “adult” is used loosely here.) Other clinical effects of Type I are fever, P abdominal distention (from hypotonicity of the large bowel), respiratory problems (pneumonia or, rarely, cor pulmonale), easy bruising and bleeding, anemia and, rarely, pancytopenia. Older patients may develop a yellow pallor and brown-yellow pigmentation on the face and legs. In Type II, motor dysfunction and spasticity occur at age\\n6 to 7 months. Other signs of the infantile form of Gaucher's disease include abdominal distention, strabismus, muscle hypertonicity, retroflexion of the head, neck rigidity, dysphagia, laryngeal stridor, hyperreflexia, seizures, respiratory distress, and easy bruising and bleeding. Clinical effects of Type III after infancy include seizures, hypertonicity, strabismus, poor coordination and mental ability and, possibly, easy bruising and bleeding. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Bone marrow aspiration showing Gaucher's cells and direct assay of glucocerebrosidase activity, which can be performed on venous blood, confirms this diagnosis. Supportive laboratory results include increased serum acid phosphatase level, decreased platelets and serum iron level and, in\\nType III, abnormal EEG after infancy. Treatment Treatment is mainly supportive and consists of vitamins, supplemental iron or liver extract to prevent anemia caused by iron deficiency and to alleviate other hematologic problems, blood transfusions for anemia, splenectomy for thrombocytopenia, and strong analgesics for bone pain. Injections of a replacement synthetic enzyme have proven helpful. Gene therapy is an experimental approach. An oral treatment with N-butyl deoxynojirimycin (OGT 918), which inhibits glucocerebrosidase formation, is being evaluated. Clinical trials have shown improvement in the key clinical features of Gaucher's disease, including liver and spleen size and, to a lesser degree, blood counts. Special considerations In the patient confined to bed, prevent pathologic fractures by turning him carefully. If he is ambulatory, make\\nsure that he's assisted when getting out of bed or walking. Observe closely for changes in pulmonary status. Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures to the patient or his parents. Help the patient accept the limitations imposed by this disorder. Recommend genetic counseling for patients with a family history of Gaucher's disease. Prenatal testing can determine if a fetus has the syndrome. Porphyrias Porphyrias are metabolic disorders that affect the biosynthesis of heme (a component of hemoglobin) and cause excessive production and excretion of porphyrins or their precursors. Porphyrins, which are present in all protoplasm, figure prominently in energy storage and utilization. Classification of porphyrias depends on the site of excessive porphyrin production; they may be erythropoietic (erythroid cells in bone marrow), hepatic (in the liver), or erythrohepatic (in bone marrow and liver). (See Types of porphyria, pages 576 and 577.)\\nAn acute episode of intermittent hepatic porphyria may cause fatal respiratory paralysis. In the other forms of porphyrias, the prognosis is good with proper treatment. PREVENTION PREVENTING PORPHYRIA Precipitating factors may lead to signs and symptoms of porphyria. Encourage the patient to avoid: crash dieting fasting specific drugs such as alcohol, barbiturates, and estrogens P stress infection. Helpful hints Stress management techniques may help because emotional stress may also precipitate an attack. Reduce infection risk with proper hand washing and avoiding people with known infection. Genetic counseling may also be of benefit to prospective parents with a family history of porphyria. Causes and incidence Porphyrias are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, except for Günther's disease (autosomal recessive trait) and toxic-acquired porphyria (usually from ingestion of or exposure to lead). Menstruation often precipitates acute porphyria in premenopausal women. (See Preventing porphyria. ) TYPES OF PORPHYRIA Porphyria Signs and symptoms Treatment Erythropoietic porphyria Günther's disease ▪ Usual onset before age 5 ▪\\nRed urine (earliest, most characteristic sign); severe cutaneous photosensitivity, leading to vesicular or bullous eruptions on exposed areas and, eventually, scarring and ulceration ▪ Hypertrichosis ▪ Brown-stained or redstained teeth ▪ Splenomegaly, hemolytic anemia ▪ Oral beta-carotene to prevent photosensitivity reactions ▪ Anti-inflammatory ointments ▪ Prednisone to reverse anemia ▪ Packed red cells to inhibit erythropoiesis and excreted porphyrins ▪ Hemin for recurrent attacks ▪ Splenectomy for hemolytic anemia ▪ Topical dihydroxyacetone and lawsone sunscreen filter Erythrohepatic porphyria Protoporphyria ▪ Usually affects children ▪ Occurs most often in males ▪ Photosensitive dermatitis ▪ Hemolytic anemia ▪ Chronic hepatic disease ▪ Avoidance of causative factors ▪ Beta-carotene to reduce photosensitivity Toxic-acquired porphyria ▪ Usually affects children ▪ Significant mortality ▪ Acute colicky pain ▪ Anorexia, nausea, vomiting ▪ Neuromuscular weakness ▪ Behavioral changes ▪ Seizures, coma ▪ Chlorpromazine I.V. to relieve pain and GI symptoms ▪ Avoidance of lead exposure Hepatic porphyria Acute intermittent porphyria ▪ Most common form ▪ Affects females most often, usually ▪ Colicky abdominal pain with fever, general malaise, and hypertension ▪ Peripheral neuritis, behavioral changes, possibly leading to frank psychosis ▪ Possible respiratory paralysis ▪ Chlorpromazine I.V. to relieve abdominal pain and control psychic abnormalities between ages 15 and 40 ▪ Avoidance of barbiturates, infections, alcohol, and fasting ▪ Hemin for recurrent attacks ▪ High-carbohydrate diet Variegate porphyria ▪ Usual onset between ages 30 and 50 ▪ Occurs almost exclusively among South African whites ▪ Affects males and females equally ▪ Skin lesions, extremely fragile skin in exposed areas ▪ Hypertrichosis ▪ Hyperpigmentation ▪ Abdominal pain during acute attack ▪ Neuropsychiatric manifestations ▪ High-carbohydrate diet ▪ Avoidance of sunlight, or wearing protective clothing when avoidance isn't possible ▪ Hemin for recurrent attacks Porphyria cutanea tarda ▪ Most frequent in men ages 40 to 60 ▪ Highest incidence in South Africans ▪ Facial pigmentation ▪ Red-brown urine ▪ Photosensitive dermatitis ▪ Hypertrichosis ▪ Avoidance of precipitating factors, such as alcohol and estrogens ▪ Phlebotomy at 2- week intervals to lower serum iron level Hereditary coproporphyria ▪ Rare ▪ Affects males and females ▪ Asymptomatic or mild neurologic, abdominal, or psychiatric symptoms ▪ High-carbohydrate diet P equally ▪ Avoidance of barbiturates ▪ Hemin for recurrent attacks Complications Neurologic and hepatic dysfunction (hepatic) Cholelithiasis Coma Flaccid paralysis, respiratory paralysis, and death (acute intermittent) Hemolytic anemia (erythropoietic) Signs and symptoms Porphyrias are generally marked by photosensitivity, acute abdominal pain, and neuropathy. Hepatic porphyrias may produce a complex syndrome marked by distinct neurologic and hepatic dysfunction: Neurologic symptoms include chronic brain syndrome, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic effects, tachycardia, labile hypertension, severe colicky lower abdominal pain, and constipation. During an acute attack, fever, leukocytosis, and fluid and electrolyte imbalance may occur. Structural hepatic effects include fatty infiltration of the liver, hepatic siderosis, and focal hepatocellular necrosis. Skin lesions may cause itching and burning, erythema, and altered pigmentation and edema in areas exposed to light. Some chronic skin changes include milia (white papules on the hands' dorsal aspects) and hirsutism on the upper cheeks and periorbital\\nareas. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS P Generally, diagnosis requires screening tests for porphyrins or their precursors (such as aminolevulinic acid [ALA] and porphobilinogen [PBG]) in urine, stool, blood or, occasionally, skin biopsy. A urinary lead level of 0.2 mg/L confirms toxic-acquired porphyria. Other laboratory values may include increased serum iron levels in porphyria cutanea tarda; leukocytosis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels in acute intermittent porphyria. DRUGS THAT AGGRAVATE PORPHYRIA Make sure the patient with porphyria doesn't receive any of the following drugs, which are known to precipitate signs and symptoms of porphyria: Alcohol Barbiturates Carbamazepine Carisoprodol Chloramphenicol Chlordiazepoxide Danazol Diazepam Ergot alkaloids Estrogens Griseofulvin Imipramine Meprobamate Methsuximide Methyldopa Pentazocine Phenytoin Progesterones Sulfonamides Tolbutamide Treatment Treatment for porphyrias includes avoiding overexposure to the sun and using beta-carotene to reduce photosensitivity, as well as support for acute and long-term management. Hemin (an enzyme-inhibitor derived from processed red blood cells) is given to control recurrent attacks of acute intermittent porphyria, Günther's disease, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria. A high-carbohydrate diet decreases urinary excretion of ALA and PBG, with restricted fluid intake to inhibit release of antidiuretic hormone. Special considerations Warn the patient to avoid excessive sun exposure, use a sunscreen when outdoors, and take a beta-carotene supplement to reduce photosensitivity. Encourage a high-carbohydrate diet. Administer beta-carotene and hemin, as ordered. Advise the patient to avoid drugs that may precipitate signs and symptoms of porphyrias. (See Drugs that aggravate porphyria. ) Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome—also called syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, dysmetabolic syndrome, and multiple metabolic syndrome — is a cluster of conditions characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood glucose (type 2 diabetes mellitus), insulin resistance, high blood cholesterol and triglycerides, and high blood pressure. More than 22% of people in the United States meet three or more of these criteria, raising P their risk of heart disease and stroke and placing them at high risk for dying of myocardial infarction. In the normal digestion process, the intestines break down food into its basic components, one of which is glucose. Glucose provides energy for cellular activity, while excess glucose is stored in\\ncells for future use. Insulin, a hormone secreted in the pancreas, guides glucose into storage cells. However, in people with metabolic syndrome, glucose is insulin- resistant and doesn't respond to insulin's attempt to guide it into storage cells. Excess insulin is then required to overcome this resistance. This excess in quantity and force of insulin causes damage to the lining of the arteries, promotes fat storage deposits, and prevents fat breakdown. This series of events can lead to diabetes, blood clots, and coronary events. Causes and incidence Abdominal obesity is a strong predictor of metabolic syndrome because abdominal fat tends to be more resistant to insulin than fat in other areas. This increases the release of free fatty acid into the portal system, leading to increased apolipoprotein B, increased\\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL), decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased triglyceride levels. As a result, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor because a hallmark for metabolic syndrome is a fasting glucose level greater than 110 mg/dl. People with diabetes develop atherosclerotic heart disease at\\na younger age than other people. They're also at increased risk of macrovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease). Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. Insulin resistance and dyslipidemia are also risk factors\\nbecause insulin resistance leads to hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, damaged endothelium, and cardiovascular disease. Insulin is also responsible for reducing the amount of free fatty acids in the liver. However, people with insulin resistance have an increased amount of free fatty acids reaching the liver, resulting in high triglycerides and LDLs and producing an abnormal endothelium and atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is a risk factor because the combination of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and abdominal obesity leads to hypertension and its harmful cardiovascular effects. Moreover, insulin resistance promotes salt sensitivity in people with high blood pressure. Research also indicates that there may be a genetic predisposition to metabolic syndrome. Complications Coronary artery disease Diabetes mellitus Hyperlipidemia Signs and symptoms Assessment commonly reveals a history of hypertension, abdominal obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and a family history of metabolic syndrome. Physical findings include abdominal obesity (evidenced by a waist of more than 40″ [101.6 cm] in men and 35″ [88.9 cm] in women), blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg or higher, and a fasting blood glucose level that's 100 mg/dl or higher. The patient may feel tired, especially after eating, and may have difficulty losing weight. If left untreated, such complications as coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and premature death may develop. Diagnosis Blood studies commonly indicate elevated blood glucose levels, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated serum uric acid. Use of lipid profile studies reveal elevated LDL levels, low HDL levels, and elevated triglycerides. Further diagnostic procedures are nonspecific, but may be performed to detect hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Treatment P Lifestyle modification, focusing on weight reduction and exercise, is an important part of the treatment regimen. Modest weight reduction through diet and exercise considerably improves hemoglobin A 1c levels, reduces insulin resistance, improves blood lipid levels, and decreases blood pressure—all elements of metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, losing an average of 7% of body weight reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%. To improve cardiovascular health, a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low-fat dairy products combined with regular exercise is recommended. Moreover, nutrient-dense,\\nlow-energy foods should replace low-nutrient, high-calorie foods. Meal replacements and shakes may also reduce risk factors for metabolic syndrome and improve weight loss. (See Therapeutic lifestyle-change diet, page 580.) A regular exercise program of moderate physical activity,\\nin addition to dietary modifications, promotes weight loss, improves insulin sensitivity, and reduces blood glucose levels. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health, a person should exercise moderately for a minimum of 30 minutes on most (if not all) days of the week. The selected exercise program should improve cardiovascular conditioning, increase strength through resistance training, and improve flexibility. Medications may be used in the treatment of metabolic syndrome for patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 or greater in the presence of other risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) or for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or greater without other risk factors.\\nWeight loss drugs may also be added to lifestyle changes if the patient\\nhasn't achieved significant weight loss after 12 weeks. THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLE-CHANGE DIET The therapeutic lifestyle-change diet is low in saturated fats and cholesterol to reduce blood cholesterol levels and prevent development of heart disease and its complications. Nutrient Recommended intake Saturated fat * < 7% of total calories Polyunsaturated fat Up to 10% of total calories Monounsaturated fat Up to 20% of total calories Total fat 25% to 35% of total calories Carbohydrate ** 50% to 60% of total calories Fiber 20 to 30 gm/day Protein Approximately 15% of total calories Cholesterol < 200 mg/day Total calories *** Balance energy intake and expenditure to maintain desirable body weight and prevent weight gain * Trans fatty acids are another low-density lipoprotein-raising fat that should be minimized or avoided. ** Carbohydrates\\nshould be derived predominantly from foods rich in complex carbohydrates, including grains—especially whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. *** Daily expenditure should include at least moderate physical activity (contributing about 200 kcal/day). Source: The National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute. Available at: www.nhlbi.nih.gov/chd/lifestyles.htm. Pharmacologic treatment may also be indicated. Phentermine is used for short-term treatment of obesity in conjunction with diet and exercise. The only two drugs that have been approved for long-term weight loss are orlistat (Xenical) and sibutramine (Meridia). Orlistat works by decreasing the absorption of dietary fat by inhibiting\\npancreatic lipase, P which is needed for fat breakdown and absorption. However, because absorption of fat-soluble vitamins is reduced, the patient may require vitamin supplementation. Studies show that when obese patients take orlistat in conjunction with dieting, they achieve greater weight loss and serum glucose control than by dieting alone. Sibutramine promotes weight loss by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and increases the satietyproducing effects of serotonin. Further, it reduces the drop in metabolic rate that commonly occurs with weight loss. Surgical treatment of obesity, such as through gastric bypass procedures, produces a greater degree and duration of weight loss\\nthan other therapies and improves or resolves most of the factors of metabolic syndrome. Candidates for surgical intervention include patients with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 or those with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 with obesity-related medical conditions. Gastric bypass procedures produce permanent weight loss in the majority of patients. Special considerations Monitor the patient's blood pressure, blood glucose, blood cholesterol, and insulin levels. Because research indicates that longer lifestyle modification programs are associated with improved weight loss\\nmaintenance, encourage patients with metabolic syndrome to begin an exercise and weight loss program with a friend or family member. Assist him in exploring options and support his efforts. To improve compliance, schedule frequent follow-up appointments with the patient. At that time, review his food diaries and exercise logs. Be positive and promote his active participation and partnership in his treatment plan. A patient planning gastric bypass surgery should receive psychological and nutritional counseling before and after\\nthe surgery to assit with diet and lifestyle changes. HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCE Potassium imbalance Potassium, a cation that's the dominant cellular electrolyte, facilitates contraction of both skeletal and smooth muscles—including myocardial contraction—and figures prominently in nerve impulse conduction, acid- base balance, enzyme action, and cell membrane function. Because serum potassium level has such a narrow range\\n(3.5 to 5 mEq/L), a slight deviation in either direction can produce profound clinical consequences. Paradoxically, both hypokalemia (potassium deficiency) and hyperkalemia (potassium excess) can lead to muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis, because both create an ionic imbalance in neuromuscular tissue excitability. Both conditions also diminish excitability and conduction rate of the heart muscle, which may\\nlead to cardiac arrest. (See Clinical effects of potassium imbalance, page 582.) Causes and incidence Because many foods contain potassium, hypokalemia seldom results from a dietary deficiency. Instead, potassium loss may result from: excessive GI losses, such as diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, or chronic laxative abuse (Vomiting and gastric suction cause dehydration, resulting in hyperaldosteronism [sodium retention and potassium excretion occur].) trauma (injury, burns, or surgery), in which damaged cells release potassium, which enters serum or extracellular fluid, to be excreted in the urine chronic renal disease, with tubular potassium wasting certain drugs, especially potassium-wasting diuretics, steroids, and certain sodium-containing antibiotics (carbenicillin) acid-base imbalances, which cause potassium shifting into cells without true depletion in alkalosis prolonged potassium-free I.V. therapy hyperglycemia, causing osmotic diuresis and glycosuria Cushing's syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, excessive licorice ingestion, and severe serum magnesium deficiency. P Hyperkalemia results from the kidneys' inability to excrete excessive amounts of potassium infused I.V. or administered orally; from decreased urine output, renal dysfunction or failure; or the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene, by patients\\nwith renal disease. It may also result from any injuries or conditions that release cellular potassium or favor its retention, such as burns, crushing injuries, failing renal function, adrenal gland insufficiency, dehydration, or diabetic acidosis. Complications Muscle weakness Flaccid paralysis Cardiac arrest Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum potassium levels less than 3.5 mEq/L confirm hypokalemia; serum levels greater than 5 mEq/L confirm hyperkalemia. Additional tests may be necessary to determine the imbalance's underlying cause. Hypokalemia is also associated with hypomagnesemia, so further study of other electrolytes is warranted. Treatment For hypokalemia, replacement therapy with potassium chloride (I.V. or orally) is the primary treatment. When diuresis is necessary, spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may be administered concurrently with a potassium-wasting diuretic to minimize potassium loss. Hypokalemia can be prevented by giving a maintenance dose of potassium I.V. to patients who may not take anything by mouth and to others predisposed to potassium loss. CLINICAL EFFECTS OF POTASSIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypokalemia Hyperkalemia Acid-base balance ▪ Metabolic alkalosis ▪ Metabolic acidosis Cardiovascular ▪\\nDizziness, hypotension, arrhythmias, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (flattened T waves, elevated U waves, depressed ST segment), cardiac arrest (with serum potassium levels < 2.5 mEq/L) ▪\\nTachycardia and later bradycardia, ECG changes (tented and elevated T waves, widened QRS complex, prolonged PR interval, flattened or absent P\\nwaves, depressed ST segment), cardiac arrest (with levels > 7 mEq/L) Gastrointestinal ▪ Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal distention, paralytic ileus or decreased peristalsis ▪ Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps Genitourinary ▪ Polyuria ▪ Oliguria, anuria Musculoskeletal ▪ Muscle weakness and fatigue, leg cramps ▪ Muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis Neurologic ▪ Malaise, irritability, confusion, mental depression, speech changes, decreased reflexes, respiratory paralysis ▪ Hyperreflexia progressing to weakness, numbness, tingling, flaccid paralysis For hyperkalemia, rapid infusion of 10% calcium gluconate\\ndecreases myocardial irritability and temporarily prevents cardiac arrest but doesn't correct serum potassium excess; it's also contraindicated in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. As an emergency measure, sodium bicarbonate I.V. increases pH and causes potassium to shift back into the cells. Insulin and 10% to 50% glucose I.V. also move potassium back into cells. Infusions should be followed by dextrose 5% in water because infusion of 10% to 15% glucose will stimulate endogenous insulin secretion. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate with 70% sorbitol produces exchange of sodium ions for potassium ions in\\nthe intestine. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis also aids in removal\\nof excess potassium. P Special considerations For hypokalemia: Check serum potassium and other electrolyte levels in patients apt to develop potassium imbalance and in\\nthose requiring potassium replacement; they risk overcorrection to hyperkalemia. Assess intake and output carefully. Remember, the kidneys excrete 80% to 90% of ingested potassium. Never give supplementary potassium to a patient whose urine output is below 600 ml/day. Also, measure GI loss from suctioning or vomiting. Administer slow-release potassium or dilute oral potassium supplements in 4 oz (118 ml) or more of water or other fluid to reduce gastric and small-bowel irritation. Determine the patient's chloride level. As ordered, give a potassium chloride supplement if the level is low; potassium gluconate if it's normal. Give potassium I.V. only after it's diluted in solution (usually, 10 mEq/100 ml of fluid); potassium is very\\nirritating to vascular, subcutaneous, and fatty tissues and may cause phlebitis or tissue necrosis if it infiltrates. Infuse slowly (no more than 20 mEq/ L/hour through central administration or 10 mEq/hour through peripheral administration) to prevent hyperkalemia. ALERT Never administer by I.V. push or bolus; it may cause cardiac arrest. Carefully monitor patients receiving cardiac glycosides because hypokalemia enhances the action of these drugs and may produce signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and arrhythmias). To prevent hypokalemia, instruct patients (especially those predisposed to hypokalemia due to long-term diuretic therapy) to include in their diet foods rich in potassium—oranges, bananas, tomatoes, milk, dried fruits, apricots, peanuts and dark green,\\nleafy vegetables. ALERT Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and respond to any irregularities immediately. For hyperkalemia: As in hypokalemia, frequently monitor serum potassium and other electrolyte levels, and carefully record intake and output. Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or rectally (by retention enema) in patients with significant potassium elevations because of intravascular sodium shifting. Watch for\\nsigns of hypokalemia with prolonged use and for clinical effects of hypoglycemia (muscle weakness, syncope, hunger, diaphoresis) with repeated insulin and glucose treatment. Watch for signs of hyperkalemia in predisposed patients, especially those with poor urine output or those receiving potassium supplements orally or I.V. Administer no more than 10 to 20 mEq/L of potassium chloride per hour; check the I.V. infusion site for signs of phlebitis or infiltration of potassium into tissues. Also, before giving a blood transfusion, check to see how long ago the blood was donated; cell hemolysis in older blood releases potassium. Infuse only fresh blood for patients with average to high serum potassium levels. Watch for and report cardiac arrhythmias. Sodium imbalance Sodium is the major cation (90%) in extracellular fluid (ECF); potassium, the major cation in intracellular fluid. During repolarization, the sodium-potassium pump continually shifts sodium into\\nthe cells and potassium out of the cells; during depolarization, it does the reverse. Sodium cation functions include maintaining tonicity and concentration of ECF, acid-base balance (reabsorption of sodium ion and excretion of hydrogen ion), nerve conduction and neuromuscular function, glandular secretion, and water balance. Although the body requires only 2 to 4 g of sodium daily, most Americans consume 6 to 10 g\\ndaily (mostly sodium P chloride, as table salt), excreting excess sodium through the kidneys and skin. A low-sodium diet or excessive use of diuretics may induce hyponatremia (decreased serum sodium concentration); dehydration may induce hypernatremia (increased serum sodium concentration). Causes and incidence Hyponatremia can result from: excessive GI loss of water and electrolytes due to vomiting, suctioning, or diarrhea; excessive perspiration or fever; use of potent diuretics; or tap-water enemas (When such losses decrease circulating fluid volume, increased secretion\\nof antidiuretic hormone [ADH] promotes maximum water reabsorption, which further dilutes serum sodium. These factors are especially likely to cause hyponatremia when combined with excessive intake of free water.) excessive drinking of water, infusion of I.V. dextrose in water without other solutes, malnutrition or starvation, or a low-sodium diet, usually in combination with one of the\\nother causes trauma, surgery (wound drainage), or burns, which cause sodium to shift into damaged cells CLINICAL EFFECTS OF SODIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hyponatremia Hypernatremia Cardiovascular ▪ Hypotension; tachycardia; with severe deficit, vasomotor collapse, thready pulse ▪ Hypertension, tachycardia, pitting edema, excessive weight gain Cutaneous ▪ Cold, clammy skin; decreased skin turgor ▪ Flushed skin; dry, sticky mucous membranes Gastrointestinal ▪ Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps ▪ Rough, dry tongue; intense thirst Genitourinary ▪ Oliguria or anuria ▪ Oliguria Neurologic ▪ Anxiety, headaches, muscle twitching and weakness, seizures ▪ Fever, agitation, restlessness, seizures Respiratory ▪ Cyanosis with severe deficiency ▪ Dyspnea, respiratory arrest, and death (from dramatic rise in osmotic pressure) adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease) or hypoaldosteronism cirrhosis of the liver with ascites syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), resulting from brain tumor, stroke, pulmonary disease, or neoplasm with ectopic ADH production. Certain drugs, such as chlorpropamide and clofibrate, may produce a SIADH-like syndrome. Causes of hypernatremia include: decreased water intake (When severe vomiting and diarrhea cause water loss that exceeds sodium loss, serum sodium levels rise, but overall extracellular fluid volume decreases.) excess adrenocortical hormones, as in Cushing's syndrome ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) salt intoxication (less common), which may be produced by excessive ingestion of table salt. Complications Seizures Coma Permanent neurologic damage Signs and symptoms Sodium imbalance has profound physiologic effects and can\\ninduce severe central nervous system, cardiovascular, and GI abnormalities. For example, hyponatremia may cause renal dysfunction or,\\nif serum sodium loss is abrupt or severe, seizures; hypernatremia may produce P pulmonary edema, circulatory disorders, and decreased level of consciousness. (See Clinical effects of sodium imbalance .) Diagnosis Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level less than\\n135 mEq/L; hypernatremia, as a serum sodium level greater than 145 mEq/L. However, additional laboratory studies are necessary to determine etiology and to differentiate between a true deficit and an apparent deficit due to sodium shift or to hypervolemia or hypovolemia. In true hyponatremia, supportive values include urine sodium greater than 100 mEq/24 hours, with low serum osmolality; in true hypernatremia, urine sodium level is less than 40 mEq/24 hours, with high serum osmolality. (See Diagnosing hyponatremia. ) DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPONATREMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist in treating a patient with hyponatremia. P Treatment Therapy for mild hyponatremia usually consists of restricted free-water intake when it's due to hemodilution, SIADH, or such conditions as heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal failure. If fluid restriction alone fails to normalize serum sodium levels, demeclocycline or lithium, which blocks ADH action in the renal tubules, can be used to promote water excretion. In extremely rare instances of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, when serum sodium levels fall below 110 mEq/L, treatment may include infusion of 3% or 5% saline solution. Treatment with saline infusion requires careful monitoring of venous pressure to prevent potentially fatal circulatory overload. The aim of treatment of secondary hyponatremia is to correct the underlying disorder. Primary treatment of hypernatremia is administration of salt-free solutions (such as dextrose in water) to return serum sodium levels to normal, followed by infusion of half-normal saline solution to\\nprevent hyponatremia. Other measures include a sodium-restricted diet and discontinuation of drugs that promote sodium retention. Special considerations When managing the patient with hyponatremia: Watch for and report extremely low serum sodium and accompanying serum chloride levels. Monitor urine specific gravity and other laboratory results. Record fluid intake and output accurately, and weigh the patient daily. During administration of isosmolar or hyperosmolar saline solution, watch closely for signs of hypervolemia (dyspnea, crackles, engorged jugular or hand veins). Report conditions that may cause excessive sodium loss (diaphoresis or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, and severe burns). Refer the patient on maintenance dosage of diuretics to a dietitian for instruction about dietary sodium intake. PREVENTION To prevent hyponatremia, administer isosmolar solutions. When managing the patient with hypernatremia: Measure serum sodium levels at least every\\n6 hours until stabilized. Monitor vital signs for changes, especially for rising pulse rate. Watch for signs of hypervolemia, especially in the patient receiving I.V. fluids. Record fluid intake and output accurately, checking for body fluid loss. Weigh the patient daily. Obtain a drug history to check for drugs that promote sodium retention. Explain the importance of sodium restriction and teach the patient how to plan a low-sodium diet. Closely\\nmonitor the serum sodium levels of high-risk patients. Calcium imbalance Calcium plays an indispensable role in cell permeability,\\nbone and teeth formation, blood coagulation, transmission of nerve impulses, and normal muscle contraction. Nearly all (99%) of the body's calcium is found in the bones. The remaining 1% exists in the blood, with 50% of the remainder bound to plasma proteins and 40% ionized or free. The ionized calcium in the serum is critical to healthy neurologic\\nfunction. The parathyroid glands regulate ionized calcium and determine\\nits resorption into bone, absorption from the GI mucosa, and excretion in urine and feces. Severe calcium imbalance requires emergency treatment because a deficiency (hypocalcemia) can lead to tetany and seizures; an excess (hypercalcemia), to cardiac arrhythmias and coma. (See Clinical effects of calcium imbalance. ) Causes and incidence Common causes of hypocalcemia include: inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, in which inadequate levels of vitamin D inhibit intestinal absorption of calcium P hypoparathyroidism as a result of injury, disease, or surgery that decreases or eliminates secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is needed for calcium absorption and normal serum calcium levels malabsorption or loss of calcium from the GI tract, caused by increased intestinal motility from severe diarrhea or laxative abuse; can also result from inadequate levels of vitamin D or PTH, or a reduction in gastric acidity, decreasing the solubility of calcium salts CLINICAL EFFECTS OF CALCIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypocalcemia Hypercalcemia Cardiovascular ▪ Arrhythmias, hypotension ▪ Signs of heart block, cardiac arrest in systole, hypertension Gastrointestinal ▪ Increased GI motility, diarrhea ▪ Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, polydipsia Musculoskeletal ▪\\nParesthesia (tingling and numbness of the fingers), tetany or painful tonic muscle spasms, facial spasms, abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, spasmodic contractions ▪ Weakness, muscle flaccidity, bone pain, pathologic fractures Neurologic ▪ Anxiety, irritability, twitching around mouth, laryngospasm, seizures, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign ▪ Drowsiness, lethargy, headaches, depression or apathy, irritability, confusion Other ▪ Blood-clotting abnormalities ▪ Renal polyuria, flank pain and, eventually, azotemia severe infections or burns, in which diseased and burned tissue traps calcium from the extracellular fluid overcorrection of acidosis, resulting in alkalosis, which causes decreased ionized calcium and induces symptoms of hypocalcemia pancreatic insufficiency, which may cause malabsorption of calcium and subsequent calcium loss in feces. In pancreatitis, participation of calcium ions in saponification contributes to calcium loss renal failure, resulting in excessive excretion of calcium secondary to increased retention of phosphate hypomagnesemia, which causes decreased PTH secretion and blocks the peripheral action of that hormone. Causes of hypercalcemia include the following: hyperparathyroidism, which increases serum\\ncalcium levels by promoting calcium absorption from the intestine, resorption from bone, and reabsorption from the kidneys hypervitaminosis D, which can promote increased absorption of calcium from the intestine tumors, which raise serum calcium levels by destroying bone or by releasing PTH or a PTH-like substance, osteoclastactivating factor, prostaglandins and, perhaps, a vitamin D-like sterol multiple fractures and prolonged immobilization, which release bone calcium and raise the serum calcium level multiple myeloma, which promotes loss of calcium from bone. Other causes include milk-alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, thiazide diuretics, and loss of serum albumin secondary to renal disease. Complications Laryngeal spasm, tetany, seizures and possibly respiratory arrest (hypocalcemia) coma and cardiac arrest (hypercalcemia) P TROUSSEAU'S SIGN To check for Trousseau's sign, apply a blood pressure cuff to the patient's arm. A carpopedal spasm that causes thumb adduction and phalangeal extension, as shown, confirms tetany. Signs and symptoms Calcium deficit causes nerve fiber irritability and repetitive muscle spasms. Consequently, characteristic symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral paresthesia, twitching, carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures and, possibly, cardiac arrhythmias. Chvostek's sign and\\nTrousseau's sign are reliable indicators of hypocalcemia. (See Trousseau's sign. Also see Chvostek's sign. ) Clinical effects of hypercalcemia include muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone, lethargy, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, polydipsia, and polyuria. Severe hypercalcemia (serum levels that exceed 15 mg/dl) may produce cardiac arrhythmias and, eventually, coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum calcium level less than 8.5 mg/ dl confirms hypocalcemia; a level more than 10.5 mg/dl confirms hypercalcemia. (However, because approximately one- half of serum calcium\\nis bound to albumin, changes in serum protein must be considered when interpreting serum calcium levels. A common conversion formula is calcium corrected = calcium actual + 0.8 × [4.0\\n- albumin level]. Ionized calcium levels are 4.65 to 5.28 mg/dl and are\\na measure of the fraction of serum calcium in ionized form.) The Sulkowitch urine test shows increased calcium precipitation in hypercalcemia. In hypocalcemia, an electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals lengthened QT interval, prolonged ST segment, and arrhythmias; in hypercalcemia, shortened QT interval and heart block. (See Diagnosing hypercalcemia, pages 590 and 591.) Treatment Treatment varies and requires correction of the acute imbalance, followed by maintenance therapy and correction of the underlying cause. Mild hypocalcemia may require nothing more than an adjustment in diet to allow adequate intake of calcium, vitamin D, and protein, possibly with oral calcium supplements. Acute hypocalcemia is an emergency that needs immediate correction by I.V. administration of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. Chronic hypocalcemia also requires vitamin D supplements to facilitate GI absorption of calcium. To correct mild deficiency states, the amounts of vitamin D in most multivitamin preparations are adequate. For severe deficiency, vitamin D\\nis used in four forms: ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2 ), cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ), calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol, a synthetic form of vitamin D 2 . Treatment of hypercalcemia primarily eliminates excess serum calcium through hydration with normal saline solution, which promotes calcium excretion in the urine. Loop diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid and P furosemide, also promote calcium excretion. (Thiazide diuretics are contraindicated in hypercalcemia because they inhibit calcium excretion.) Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and hydrocortisone, are helpful in treating sarcoidosis, hypervitaminosis D,\\nand certain tumors. Plicamycin can also lower serum calcium levels and is especially effective against hypercalcemia secondary to certain tumors. Calcitonin may also be helpful in certain instances. Sodium phosphate solution administered orally or by retention enema promotes calcium deposition in bone and inhibits its absorption from the GI tract. Special considerations Watch for hypocalcemia in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrated blood; in those with chronic diarrhea, severe infections, and insufficient dietary intake of calcium and protein (especially in elderly patients); and in those who are hyperventilating. Check serum calcium level every 12 to 24 hours, and report a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dl immediately. When giving calcium supplements, frequently check the pH level because a pH lower than 7.45 inhibits calcium ionization. Check for Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs. Administer calcium gluconate slow I.V. in 5% dextrose in water ( never in saline solution, which encourages renal calcium loss). Don't add calcium gluconate I.V. to solutions containing bicarbonate; it will precipitate. When administering calcium solutions, watch for anorexia, nausea, and vomiting—possible signs of overcorrection to hypercalcemia. Never infuse more than 1g/hour, except in an emergency. Use a volume-control device to ensure proper flow rate. If the patient is receiving calcium chloride, watch for abdominal discomfort. ALERT Don't confuse calcium chloride with calcium gluconate in administration; 1 gm of calcium chloride has three times the calcium as 1 gm of calcium gluconate. Monitor the patient closely for a possible\\ndrug interaction if he's receiving cardiac glycosides with large doses of oral calcium supplements; watch for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, yellow vision, and cardiac arrhythmias). Administer oral calcium supplements 1 to 11/2 hours after meals or with milk. Provide a quiet, stress-free environment for the patient with tetany. Observe seizure precautions for patients with severe hypocalcemia. PREVENTION To prevent hypocalcemia, advise all patients—especially elderly patients—to eat foods rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, such as fortified milk and cheese. Explain how important calcium is for normal bone formation and blood coagulation. Discourage chronic use of laxatives. Also, warn hypocalcemic patients not to overuse antacids, because these may aggravate the condition. CHVOSTEK'S SIGN To check for Chvostek's sign, tap the facial nerve above the mandibular angle, adjacent to the earlobe. A facial muscle spasm that causes the patient's upper lip to twitch, as shown, confirms tetany. P If the patient has hypercalcemia: Check serum calcium level frequently. Watch for cardiac arrhythmias if serum calcium levels exceed their normal values of 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dl. Increase fluid intake to dilute calcium in serum and urine, and to prevent renal damage and dehydration.\\nWatch for signs of heart failure in patients receiving normal saline diuresis. Administer loop diuretics (not thiazide diuretics), as ordered. Monitor intake and output, and check urine for renal calculi and acidity. Provide acid-ash drinks, such as cranberry or\\nprune juice, because calcium salts are more soluble in acid than in alkali. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSING HYPERCALCEMIA This flowchart lists possible diagnostic findings and interpretations to assist with treatment of the patient with hypercalcemia. P P 2 Check ECG and vital signs frequently. In the patient receiving cardiac glycosides, watch for signs of toxicity, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia (often with arrhythmia). Ambulate the patient as soon as possible. Handle the patient with chronic hypercalcemia gently to prevent pathologic fractures. If the patient is bedridden, reposition him frequently and encourage range-of- motion exercises to promote circulation and prevent urinary stasis and calcium loss from bone. To prevent recurrence, suggest a lowcalcium diet, with increased fluid intake. Chloride imbalance Hypochloremia and hyperchloremia are, respectively, conditions of deficient or excessive serum levels of the chloride anion.\\nA predominantly extracellular anion, chloride accounts for two-thirds of all serum anions. Secreted by stomach mucosa as hydrochloric acid, it provides an acid medium that aids digestion and activation of enzymes. Chloride also participates in maintaining acid-base and body water balances, influences the osmolality or tonicity of extracellular fluid (ECF), plays a role in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in red blood cells, and helps activate salivary amylase (which, in turn, activates the digestive process). Causes and incidence Hypochloremia may result from: decreased chloride intake or absorption, as in low dietary sodium intake, sodium deficiency, potassium deficiency, metabolic alkalosis; prolonged use of mercurial diuretics; or administration of dextrose I.V. without electrolytes excessive chloride loss resulting from prolonged diarrhea or diaphoresis; loss of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions due to vomiting, gastric suctioning, or gastric surgery. Hyperchloremia may result from: excessive chloride intake or absorption —as in hyperingestion of ammonium chloride, or ureterointestinal anastomosis —allowing reabsorption of chloride by the bowel hemoconcentration from dehydration compensatory mechanisms for other metabolic abnormalities, as in metabolic acidosis, brain stem injury causing neurogenic hyperventilation, and hyperparathyroidism. Complications Depressed respirations leading to respiratory arrest (hypochloremia) Coma (hyperchloremia) Signs and symptoms Hypochloremia is usually associated with hyponatremia and\\nits characteristic muscle weakness and twitching because renal chloride loss always accompanies sodium loss, and sodium reabsorption isn't possible without chloride. However, if chloride depletion results from metabolic alkalosis secondary to loss of gastric secretions, chloride is lost independently from sodium; typical symptoms are muscle hypertonicity, tetany, and shallow, depressed breathing. Because of the natural affinity of sodium and chloride ions, hyperchloremia usually produces clinical effects associated with hypernatremia and resulting ECF volume excess (agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, pitting edema, dyspnea). Hyperchloremia associated with metabolic acidosis is due to excretion of base bicarbonate by the kidneys, and induces deep, rapid breathing; weakness; diminished cognitive ability; and, ultimately, coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A serum chloride level below 98 mEq/L confirms hypochloremia. (Supportive values in metabolic alkalosis include serum pH above 7.45 and serum carbon dioxide [CO 2 ] level above 32 mEq/L.) A serum chloride level above 108 mEq/L confirms hyperchloremia; with P metabolic acidosis, serum pH is below 7.35 and serum CO 2 level is below 22 mEq/L. Treatment Hypochloremia therapy aims to correct the condition that causes excessive chloride loss and to give oral replacement such as salty broth. When oral therapy isn't possible, or when emergency measures are necessary, treatment may\\ninclude normal saline solution I.V. (if hypovolemia is present) or chloride-containing drugs, such as ammonium chloride, to increase serum chloride levels, and potassium chloride for metabolic alkalosis. For severe hyperchloremic acidosis, treatment consists of sodium bicarbonate\\nI.V. to raise the serum bicarbonate level and permit renal excretion of\\nthe chloride anion, because bicarbonate and chloride compete for combination with sodium. For mild hyperchloremia, Ringer's lactate solution is administered; it converts to bicarbonate in the liver, thus increasing base bicarbonate to correct acidosis. In either kind of chloride imbalance, treatment must correct the underlying disorder. Special considerations When managing the patient with hypochloremia: Check serum chloride level frequently, particularly during I.V. therapy. Watch for signs of hyperchloremia or hypochloremia. Be alert for respiratory difficulty. To prevent hypochloremia, monitor laboratory results (serum electrolyte levels and blood gas values) and fluid intake and output of patients who are vulnerable to chloride imbalance, particularly those recovering from gastric surgery. Record and report excessive or continuous loss of gastric secretions. Also report prolonged infusion of dextrose in water without saline. When managing the patient with hyperchloremia: Check serum electrolyte levels every 3 to 6\\nhours. If the patient is receiving high doses of sodium bicarbonate, watch for signs of overcorrection (metabolic alkalosis, respiratory depression) or lingering signs of hyperchloremia, which indicate inadequate treatment. PREVENTION To prevent hyperchloremia, check laboratory results for elevated serum chloride levels or potassium imbalance if the patient is receiving I.V. solutions containing sodium chloride, and monitor fluid intake and output. Also, watch for signs of metabolic acidosis. When administering I.V. fluids containing Ringer's lactate solution, monitor flow rate according to the patient's age, physical condition, and bicarbonate level. Report any irregularities promptly. Magnesium imbalance Magnesium is the second most common cation in intracellular fluid. Although its major function is to enhance neuromuscular integration, it also stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, thus regulating intracellular fluid calcium levels. Therefore, magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) may result in transient\\nhypoparathyroidism or interference with the peripheral action of PTH. Magnesium may also regulate skeletal muscles through its influence on calcium utilization by depressing acetylcholine release at synaptic junctions. In addition, magnesium activates many enzymes for proper carbohydrate and protein metabolism, aids in cell metabolism and the transport of sodium and potassium across cell membranes, and influences sodium, potassium, calcium, and protein levels. About one-third of magnesium taken into the body is absorbed through the small intestine and is eventually excreted in the urine; the remaining unabsorbed magnesium is excreted in the stool. Because many common foods contain magnesium, a dietary deficiency is rare. Hypomagnesemia generally follows impaired absorption, too-rapid excretion, or inadequate intake during total parenteral nutrition. It frequently coexists with other electrolyte imbalances, especially low P calcium and potassium levels. Magnesium excess (hypermagnesemia) is common in patients with renal failure and excessive intake of magnesium-containing antacids. Causes and incidence Hypomagnesemia usually results from impaired absorption of magnesium in the intestines or excessive excretion in urine or stool.\\nPossible causes include: decreased magnesium intake or absorption, as in malabsorption syndrome, chronic diarrhea, or postoperative complications after bowel resection; chronic alcoholism; prolonged diuretic therapy, nasogastric suctioning, or administration of parenteral fluids without magnesium salts; and starvation or malnutrition excessive loss of magnesium, as in severe dehydration and diabetic acidosis; hyperaldosteronism and hypoparathyroidism, which result in hypokalemia and hypocalcemia; hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia; excessive release of adrenocortical hormones; and diuretic therapy. Hypermagnesemia results from the kidneys' inability to excrete magnesium that was either absorbed from the intestines or infused. Common causes of hypermagnesemia include: chronic renal insufficiency use of laxatives (magnesium sulfate, milk of magnesia, and magnesium citrate solutions), especially with renal insufficiency overuse of magnesium-containing antacids severe dehydration (resulting oliguria can cause magnesium retention) overcorrection of hypomagnesemia. Complications Cardiac arrhythmias, hypoparathyroidism, seizures, confusion and coma (hypomagnesemia) Complete heart block and respiratory paralysis (hypermagnesemia) Signs and symptoms Hypomagnesemia causes neuromuscular irritability and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypermagnesemia causes central nervous system and respiratory depression, in addition to neuromuscular and cardiac effects. (See Signs and symptoms of magnesium imbalance .) Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum magnesium level less than 1.5 mEq/ L confirms hypomagnesemia; a level greater than 2.5 mEq/L confirms hypermagnesemia. Low levels of other serum electrolytes (especially potassium and calcium) often coexist with hypomagnesemia. In fact, unresponsiveness to correct treatment for hypokalemia strongly suggests hypomagnesemia. Similarly, elevated levels of other serum electrolytes are associated with hypermagnesemia. Treatment Therapy for magnesium imbalance aims to identify and correct the underlying cause. Treatment of mild hypomagnesemia consists of daily magnesium supplements I.M. or orally; of severe hypomagnesemia, magnesium sulfate I.V. (10 to 40 mEq/L diluted in I.V. fluid). Magnesium\\nintoxication (a possible adverse effect) requires calcium gluconate I.V. Therapy for hypermagnesemia includes increased fluid intake and loop diuretics (such as furosemide) with impaired renal function; calcium gluconate (10%), a magnesium antagonist, for temporary\\nrelief of symptoms in an emergency; and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis if renal function fails or if excess magnesium can't be eliminated. Special considerations P For patients with hypomagnesemia: Monitor serum electrolyte levels (including magnesium, calcium, and potassium) daily for mild deficits and every 6 to 12 hours during replacement therapy. Measure intake and output frequently. (Urine output shouldn't fall below 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/day in patients with healthy body weight; in heavier patients, less than 50 ml/hour is a cause for concern.) Remember, the kidneys excrete excess magnesium, and hypermagnesemia could occur with renal insufficiency. ALERT Monitor vital signs during I.V. therapy. Infuse magnesium replacement slowly and watch for bradycardia, heart block, and decreased respiratory rate. Have calcium gluconate I.V.\\navailable to reverse hypermagnesemia from overcorrection. In patients with torsade de pointes, elevated magnesium levels are therapeutic. Advise patients to eat foods high in magnesium, such as fish and green vegetables. Watch for and report signs of hypomagnesemia in patients with predisposing diseases or conditions, especially those not permitted anything by mouth or who receive I.V. fluids without magnesium. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MAGNESIUM IMBALANCE Dysfunction Hypomagnesemia Hypermagnesemia Cardiovascular ▪ Arrhythmias (such as torsade de pointes), vasomotor changes (vasodilation and hypotension) and, occasionally, hypertension ▪ Bradycardia, weak pulse, hypotension, heart block, cardiac arrest (common with serum levels of 25 mEq/L) Neurologic ▪ Confusion, delusions, hallucinations, seizures ▪ Drowsiness, flushing, lethargy, confusion, diminished sensorium Neuromuscular ▪ Hyperirritability, tetany, leg and foot cramps, Chvostek's sign (facial muscle spasms induced by tapping the branches of the facial nerve) ▪ Diminished reflexes, muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, respiratory muscle paralysis that may cause respiratory insufficiency For patients with hypermagnesemia: Frequently assess level of consciousness, muscle activity, and vital signs. Keep accurate intake and output records. Provide sufficient fluids for adequate hydration and maintenance of renal function. Report abnormal serum electrolyte levels immediately. Monitor and report electrocardiogram changes (peaked T waves, increased PR intervals, widened QRS complex). Watch patients receiving cardiac glycosides and calcium gluconate simultaneously, because calcium excess enhances digoxin action, predisposing the patient to digoxin toxicity. Advise patients, particularly elderly patients and patients with compromised renal function, not to abuse laxatives and antacids containing magnesium. Watch for signs of hypermagnesemia in predisposed patients. Observe closely for respiratory distress if magnesium serum levels rise above 10 mEq/L. Phosphorus imbalance Phosphorus exists primarily in inorganic combination with\\ncalcium in teeth and bones. In extracellular fluid, the phosphate ion supports several metabolic functions: utilization of B vitamins, acid-base homeostasis, bone formation, nerve and muscle activity, cell division, transmission of hereditary traits, and metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate is inversely regulated by calcium levels—an increase in phosphorus causes a P decrease in calcium. An imbalance causes hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia. Incidence of hypophosphatemia varies with the underlying cause; hyperphosphatemia occurs most often in\\nchildren, who tend to consume more phosphorus-rich foods and beverages than adults, and in children and adults with renal insufficiency. The prognosis for both conditions depends on the underlying cause. Causes and incidence Hypophosphatemia is usually the result of inadequate dietary intake; it's often related to malnutrition resulting from a prolonged catabolic state or chronic alcoholism. It may also stem from intestinal malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, hyperparathyroidism with resultant hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or deficiency of vitamin D, which is necessary for intestinal phosphorus absorption. Other causes include chronic use of antacids containing aluminum hydroxide, use of parenteral nutrition solution with inadequate phosphate content, renal tubular defects, tissue damage in which phosphorus is released by injured cells, and diabetic acidosis. FOODS HIGH IN PHOSPHORUS Food Portion Amount (mg) Almonds 2/3 cup 475 Beef liver (fried) 31/2 oz 476 Broccoli (cooked) 2/3 cup 62 Carbonated beverages 12 oz Up to 500 Milk (whole) 8 oz 93 Turkey (roasted) 31/2 oz 251 Hyperphosphatemia is generally secondary to hypocalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, hypoparathyroidism, or renal failure (often due to stress or injury). It may also result from overuse of laxatives with phosphates or phosphate enemas. Complications Hypophosphatemia — heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and coma Hyperphosphatemia — soft-tissue complications Signs and symptoms Hypophosphatemia produces anorexia, muscle weakness, tremor, paresthesia and, when persistent, osteomalacia, causing bone pain. Impaired red blood cell functions may occur in hypophosphatemia due to alterations in oxyhemoglobin dissociation, which may result in peripheral hypoxia. Hyperphosphatemia usually remains asymptomatic unless it results in hypocalcemia, with tetany and seizures. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum phosphorus levels less than 1.7 mEq/ L or 2.5 mg/dl confirm hypophosphatemia. Urine phosphorus levels above 1.3 g/24 hours support this diagnosis. Serum phosphorus levels above 2.6 mEq/L or 4.5 mg/dl confirm hyperphosphatemia. Supportive values include decreased levels of serum calcium (less than 9\\nmg/dl) and urine phosphorus (less than 0.9 g/24 hours). Treatment Treatment aims to correct the underlying cause of phosphorus imbalance. Until this is done, management of hypophosphatemia consists of phosphorus replacement with a high-phosphorus diet and oral administration of phosphate salt tablets or capsules. (See Foods high in phosphorus .)\\nSevere hypophosphatemia requires I.V. infusion of P potassium phosphate. Severe hyperphosphatemia may require peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis\\nto lower the serum phosphorus level. Special considerations Carefully monitor serum electrolyte, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Report any changes immediately. To manage hypophosphatemia: Record intake and output accurately. Administer potassium phosphate slow I.V. to prevent overcorrection to hyperphosphatemia. Assess renal function and be alert for hypocalcemia when giving phosphate supplements. If phosphate salt tablets cause nausea, use capsules instead. To prevent recurrence, advise the patient to follow a high-phosphorus diet containing milk and milk products, kidney, liver, turkey, and dried fruits. To manage hyperphosphatemia: Monitor intake and output. If urine output\\nfalls below 25 ml/hour or 600 ml/day, notify the physician immediately,\\nbecause decreased output can seriously affect renal clearance of excess\\nserum phosphorus. Watch for signs of hypocalcemia, such as muscle twitching and tetany, which often accompany hyperphosphatemia. To prevent recurrence, advise the patient to eat foods with low phosphorus content such as vegetables. Obtain dietary consultation if the condition results from chronic renal insufficiency. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), also known as dilutional hyponatremia, is marked by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which disturbs fluid and electrolyte balance. Such disturbances result from the inability to excrete dilute urine, free water retention, extracellular fluid volume expansion, and hyponatremia. SIADH occurs secondary to diseases that affect the osmoreceptors (supraoptic nucleus)\\nof the hypothalamus. The prognosis depends on the underlying disorder and response to treatment. Causes and incidence The most common cause of SIADH (80% of patients) is oat cell carcinoma of the lung, which secretes excessive ADH or vasopressor-like substances. Other neoplastic diseases, such as pancreatic and prostatic cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and thymoma, may also trigger SIADH. Less common causes include: central nervous system disorders: brain tumor or abscess, stroke, head injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and lupus erythematosus pulmonary disorders: pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung abscess, and positive-pressure ventilation drugs: chlorpropamide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, carbamazepine, clofibrate, and morphine miscellaneous conditions: myxedema and psychosis. Complications Water intoxification Cerebral edema Severe hyponatremia Coma Signs and symptoms SIADH may produce weight gain despite anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; muscle weakness; restlessness; and, possibly, coma and seizures. Edema is rare unless water overload exceeds 4 L because much of the free water excess is within cellular boundaries. Diagnosis P A complete medical history revealing positive water balance may suggest SIADH. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Serum osmolality less than 280 mOsm/kg of water and a serum sodium level below 123 mEq/L confirm the diagnosis (normal urine osmolality is 11/2 times serum values). Supportive laboratory values include high urine sodium secretion (more than 20 mEq/L) without diuretics and high urine osmolality. In addition, diagnostic studies show normal renal function and no evidence of dehydration. Treatment Treatment for SIADH is symptomatic and begins with restricted water intake (500 to 1,000 ml/day). Some patients who continue to have symptoms are given a high-salt, high-protein diet or urea supplements to enhance water excretion. They may also receive demeclocycline or lithium to help block the renal response to ADH. With severe water intoxication, administration of 200 to 300 ml of 5% saline may be necessary to raise the serum sodium level. When possible, treatment should include correction of the underlying cause of SIADH. If\\nSIADH is due to cancer, success in alleviating water retention may be obtained by surgical resection, irradiation, or chemotherapy. Special considerations Closely monitor and record intake and output, vital signs, and daily weight. Watch for hyponatremia. Observe the patient for restlessness, irritability, seizures, heart failure, and unresponsiveness due to hyponatremia and water intoxication. To prevent water intoxication, explain to the patient and his family why he must restrict his intake. Metabolic acidosis Metabolic acidosis is a physiologic state of excess acid accumulation and deficient base bicarbonate produced by an underlying pathologic disorder. Symptoms result from the body's attempts to correct\\nthe acidotic condition through compensatory mechanisms in the lungs, kidneys, and cells. Metabolic acidosis is more prevalent among children, who are vulnerable to acid-base imbalance because their metabolic rates\\nare faster and their ratios of water to total-body weight are lower. Severe or untreated metabolic acidosis can be fatal. Causes and incidence Metabolic acidosis usually results from excessive fat burning in the absence of usable carbohydrates. This can be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or a low-carbohydrate, highfat diet—all of which produce more keto acids than\\nthe metabolic process can handle. Other causes include: anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism: a decrease in tissue oxygenation or perfusion (as occurs with pump failure\\nafter myocardial infarction, or with pulmonary or hepatic disease, shock, or anemia) forces a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, causing a corresponding rise in lactic acid level renal insufficiency and failure (renal acidosis): underexcretion of metabolized acids or inability to conserve base diarrhea and intestinal malabsorption: loss of sodium bicarbonate from the intestines, causing the bicarbonate buffer system to shift to the acidic side. For example, ureteroenterostomy and Crohn's disease can also induce metabolic acidosis. Less often, metabolic acidosis results from salicylate intoxication (overuse of aspirin), exogenous poisoning, or Addison's disease with an increased excretion of sodium and chloride, and retention of potassium ions. Complications Coma Arrhythmias Cardiac arrest Signs and symptoms In mild acidosis, the underlying disease's symptoms may obscure any direct clinical evidence. Metabolic acidosis typically begins with headache and lethargy, progressing to drowsiness, central nervous system depression, Kussmaul's respirations (as the lungs attempt\\nto compensate by “blowing off” carbon dioxide), stupor and, if the condition is severe and goes untreated, coma and death. Associated GI distress usually produces anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and may lead to dehydration. Underlying diabetes mellitus may cause fruity breath from catabolism of fats and excretion of accumulated acetone through the lungs. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Arterial pH below 7.35 confirms metabolic acidosis. In severe acidotic states, pH may fall to 7.10, and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide may be normal or below 34 mm Hg as compensatory mechanisms take hold. Bicarbonate may be below 22 mEq/L. A metabolic panel can help reveal the cause and severity of metabolic acidosis. A complete blood count can be done to help assess\\npossible causes as well. Supportive findings include: urine pH: below 4.5 in the absence of renal disease serum potassium levels: above 5.5 mEq/ L from chemical buffering glucose levels: above 150 mg/dl in diabetes serum ketone bodies: elevated levels in diabetes mellitus serum osmolarity: increased levels, as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic acidosis or dehydration plasma lactic acid: elevated levels in lactic acidosis P anion gap: greater than 14 mEq/L indicating metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, alcohol poisoning). (See Anion gap. ) Treatment In metabolic acidosis, treatment consists of administration of sodium bicarbonate I.V. for severe cases, evaluation and correction of electrolyte imbalances and, ultimately, correction of the underlying cause. For example, in diabetic ketoacidosis, a low-dose continuous I.V. infusion of insulin is recommended. ANION GAP The anion gap is the difference between concentrations of\\nserum cations and anions —determined by measuring one cation (sodium) and two anions (chloride and bicarbonate). The normal concentration of sodium is 140 mEq/L; of chloride, 102 mEq/L; and of bicarbonate, 26 mEq/L. Thus, the anion gap between measured cations (actually sodium alone) and measured anions is about 12 mEq/L (140 minus 128). Concentrations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium ( unmeasured cations), or proteins, phosphate, sulfate, and organic acids ( unmeasured anions) aren't needed to measure the anion gap. Added together, the concentration of unmeasured cations would be about 11 mEq/L; of unmeasured anions, about 23 mEq/L. Thus, the normal anion gap between unmeasured cations and anions is about 12 mEq/L (23 minus 11)—plus or minus 2 mEq/L for normal variation. An anion gap over 14 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. It may result from accumulation of excess organic acids or from retention of hydrogen ions,\\nwhich chemically bond with bicarbonate and decrease bicarbonate levels. Special considerations Keep sodium bicarbonate ampules handy for emergency administration. Monitor vital signs, laboratory results, and level of consciousness frequently because changes can occur rapidly. In diabetic acidosis, watch for secondary changes due to hypovolemia, such as decreasing blood pressure. Record intake and output accurately to monitor renal function. Watch for signs of excessive serum potassium—weakness, flaccid paralysis, and arrhythmias, possibly leading\\nto cardiac arrest. After treatment, check for overcorrection to hypokalemia. Because metabolic acidosis commonly causes\\nvomiting, position the patient to prevent aspiration. Prepare for possible seizures with seizure precautions. Provide good oral hygiene. Use sodium bicarbonate washes to neutralize mouth acids, and lubricate the patient's lips with lemon and glycerin swabs as indicated. PREVENTION Carefully observe patients receiving\\nI.V. therapy or who have intestinal tubes in place as well as those suffering from shock, hyperthyroidism, hepatic disease, circulatory failure, or dehydration. Teach the patient with diabetes how to routinely test urine for glucose and acetone, and encourage strict adherence to insulin or oral hypoglycemic therapy. Metabolic alkalosis A clinical state marked by decreased amounts of acid or increased amounts of base bicarbonate, metabolic alkalosis causes metabolic, respiratory, and renal responses, producing characteristic symptoms (most notably hypoventilation). This condition is always secondary to an underlying cause. With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, prognosis is good; however, untreated metabolic alkalosis may\\nlead to coma and death. P Causes and incidence Metabolic alkalosis results from loss of acid, retention of base, or renal mechanisms associated with decreased serum levels of potassium and chloride. Causes of critical acid loss include vomiting, nasogastric (NG) tube drainage or lavage without adequate electrolyte replacement, fistulas, and the use of steroids and certain diuretics (furosemide, thiazides, and ethacrynic acid). Hyperadrenocorticism is another cause of severe acid loss. Cushing's disease, primary hyperaldosteronism, and Bartter's syndrome, for example, all lead to retention of sodium and chloride, and\\nurinary loss of potassium and hydrogen. Excessive base retention can result from excessive intake\\nof bicarbonate of soda or other antacids (usually for treatment of gastritis or peptic ulcer), excessive intake of absorbable alkali (as in\\nmilk-alkali syndrome, often seen in patients with peptic ulcers), administration of excessive amounts of I.V. fluids with high concentrations of bicarbonate or lactate, or respiratory insufficiency—all of which cause chronic hypercapnia from high levels of\\nplasma bicarbonate. Complications Coma Atrioventricular arrhythmias Signs and symptoms Clinical features of metabolic alkalosis result from the body's attempt to correct the acid-base imbalance, primarily through hypoventilation. Other manifestations include irritability, picking at bedclothes (carphology), twitching, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (which aggravates alkalosis). Cardiovascular abnormalities (such as atrial tachycardia) and respiratory disturbances (such as cyanosis and apnea) also occur. In the alkalotic patient, diminished peripheral blood flow during repeated blood pressure checks may provoke carpopedal spasm in the hand—a possible sign of impending tetany (Trousseau's sign). Uncorrected metabolic alkalosis may progress to seizures and coma. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Blood pH level greater than 7.45 and\\nbicarbonate levels above 29 mEq/L confirm the diagnosis. A partial pressure of carbon dioxide above 45 mm Hg indicates attempts at respiratory compensation. Serum electrolyte studies show low potassium, calcium, and chloride levels. Other characteristic findings include: Urine pH is usually about 7.0. Urinalysis reveals alkalinity after the renal compensatory mechanism begins to excrete bicarbonate. Electrocardiogram may show low T wave, merging with a U wave (secondary to hypocalcemia from metabolic alkalosis), and atrial or sinus tachycardia. Treatment Treatment aims to correct the underlying cause of metabolic alkalosis. Therapy for severe alkalosis may include cautious administration of ammonium chloride I.V. or hydrochloric acid to release\\nhydrogen chloride and restore concentration of extracellular fluid and chloride levels. Potassium chloride and normal saline solution (except in the presence of heart failure) are usually sufficient to replace losses from gastric drainage. Electrolyte replacement with potassium chloride and discontinuing diuretics correct metabolic alkalosis resulting from potent diuretic therapy. Oral or I.V. acetazolamide, which enhances renal bicarbonate excretion, may be prescribed to correct metabolic alkalosis without rapid volume expansion. Because acetazolamide also enhances potassium excretion, potassium may have to be administered before giving\\nthis drug. P Special considerations Structure the care plan around cautious I.V. therapy, keen observation, and strict monitoring of the patient's status. Dilute potassium when giving I.V. containing potassium salts. Monitor the infusion rate to prevent damage to blood vessels; watch for signs of phlebitis. When administering ammonium chloride 0.9%, limit the infusion rate to 1 L in 4 hours; faster administration may cause hemolysis of red blood cells. Avoid overdosage because it may cause overcorrection to metabolic acidosis. Don't give ammonium chloride with signs of hepatic or renal disease; instead, use hydrochloric acid. Watch closely for signs of muscle weakness, tetany, or decreased activity. Monitor vital signs frequently and record intake and output to evaluate respiratory, fluid, and electrolyte status. Remember, respiratory rate usually decreases in an effort to compensate for alkalosis. Hypotension and tachycardia may indicate electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalemia. Observe seizure precautions. PREVENTION To prevent metabolic alkalosis, warn\\npatients against overusing alkaline agents. Irrigate NG tubes with isotonic saline solution instead of plain water to prevent loss of gastric electrolytes. Monitor I.V. fluid concentrations of bicarbonate or lactate. Teach patients with ulcers to recognize signs of milk-alkali\\nsyndrome: a distaste for milk, anorexia, weakness, and lethargy.

            "First value: {'Introduction': ['P : Title: Professional Guide to Diseases, 9th Edition Copyright ©2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins > Table of Contents > 1 - Cardiovascular disorders 1 Cardiovascular disorders Introduction The cardiovascular system begins its activity when the fetus is barely a month old and is the last body system to cease activity at the end of life. This system is so vital that its activity defines the presence of life.'], 'Life-giving transport system': [\"The heart, arteries, veins, and lymphatics form the cardiovascular network that serves as the body's transport system, bringing life-supporting oxygen and nutrients to cells, removing metabolic waste products, and carrying hormones from one part of the body to another. Often called the circulatory system, it may be divided into two branches: pulmonary circulation, in which blood picks up new oxygen and liberates the waste product carbon dioxide; and systemic circulation (including coronary circulation), in which blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all active cells while transporting waste products to the kidneys, liver, and skin for excretion. Circulation requires normal functioning of the heart, which propels blood through the system by continuous rhythmic contractions. Located behind the sternum, the heart is a muscular organ the size of a man's fist. It has three layers: the endocardium — the smooth inner layer; the myocardium — the thick, muscular middle layer that contracts in rhythmic beats; and the epicardium— the thin, serous membrane, or outer surface of the heart. Covering the entire heart is a saclike membrane called the pericardium, which has two layers: a visceral layer that's in contact with the heart and a parietal, or outer, layer. To prevent irritation when the heart moves against this layer during contraction, fluid lubricates the parietal pericardium. The heart has four chambers: two thin-walled chambers called atria and two thick-walled chambers called ventricles. The atria serve as reservoirs during ventricular contraction (systole) and as booster pumps during ventricular relaxation (diastole). The left ventricle propels blood through the systemic circulation. The right ventricle, which forces blood through the pulmonary circulation, is much thinner than the left because it meets only one-sixth the resistance. ELDER TIP As a person's body ages, the ventricular and aortic walls stiffen, decreasing the heart's pumping action.\"], 'Heart valves': [\"Two kinds of valves work inside the heart: atrioventricular and semilunar. The atrioventricular valve between the right atrium and ventricle has three leaflets, or cusps, and three papillary muscles; hence, it's called the tricuspid valve. The atrioventricular valve between the left atrium and ventricle consists of\\ntwo cusps shaped like a bishop's miter and two papillary muscles and is\\ncalled the mitral valve. The tricuspid and mitral valves prevent blood backflow from the ventricles to the atria during ventricular contraction. The leaflets of both valves are attached\\nto the ventricles' papillary muscles by thin, fibrous bands called chordae tendineae; the leaflets separate and descend funnellike into the P ventricles during\\ndiastole and are pushed upward and together during systole to occlude the mitral and tricuspid orifices. The valves' action isn't entirely passive because papillary muscles contract during systole and prevent the leaflets from prolapsing into the atria during ventricular contraction. The two semilunar valves, which resemble half moons, prevent blood backflow from the aorta and pulmonary arteries into the ventricles when those chambers relax and fill with blood from the atria. They're referred to as the aortic valve and pulmonic valve for their respective arteries. ELDER TIP In elderly people, fibrotic and sclerotic changes thicken heart valves and reduce their flexibility. These changes lead to rigidity and incomplete closure of the valves, which may result in systolic or diastolic murmurs.\"], 'The cardiac cycle': [\"Diastole is the phase of ventricular relaxation and filling. As diastole begins, ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure, and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. As ventricular pressure continues to fall below atrial pressure, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and blood flows rapidly into the ventricles. Atrial contraction then increases the volume of ventricular filling by pumping 15% to 25% more blood into the ventricles. When systole begins, the ventricular muscle contracts, raising ventricular pressure above atrial pressure and closing the mitral and tricuspid valves. When ventricular pressure finally becomes greater than that in the aorta and pulmonary artery, the aortic and pulmonic valves open, and the ventricles eject blood. Ventricular pressure continues to rise as blood is expelled from the heart. As systole ends, the ventricles relax and stop ejecting blood, and ventricular pressure falls, closing both valves. S 1 (the first heart sound) is heard as the ventricles contract and the atrioventricular valves close. S 1 is loudest at the heart's apex, over the mitral area. S 2 (the second heart sound), which is normally rapid and sharp, occurs when the aortic and pulmonic valves close. S 2 is loudest at the heart's base (second intercostal space on both sides of the sternum). Normally, with inspiration, a split S 2 will be auscultated. With expiration, the splitting becomes closer or may become single. However, a fixed split S 2 will be heard if the patient has a right bundle-branch block. Ventricular distention during diastole, which can occur in heart failure, creates low-frequency vibrations that may be heard as a\\nthird heart sound (S 3 ), or ventricular gallop. An atrial gallop (S 4 ) may appear at the end of diastole, just before S 1 ,\\nif atrial filling is forced into a ventricle that has become less compliant or overdistended or has a decreased ability to contract. A pressure rise and ventricular vibrations cause this sound.\"], 'Cardiac conduction': [\"The heart's conduction system is composed of specialized cells capable of generating and conducting rhythmic electrical impulses to stimulate heart contraction. This system includes the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) junction, the bundle of His and its bundle branches, and the ventricular conduction tissue and Purkinje fibers. Normally, the SA node controls the heart rate and rhythm at 60 to 100 beats/minute. Because the SA node has the lowest resting potential, it's the heart's pacemaker. If it defaults, another part of the system takes over. The AV junction may emerge at 40 to 60 beats/minute; the bundle of His and bundle branches at 30 to 40 beats/minute; and ventricular conduction tissue at 20 to 30 beats/minute. ELDER TIP P As the myocardium of the aging heart\\nbecomes more irritable, extrasystoles may occur along with sinus arrhythmias and sinus bradycardias. In addition, increased fibrous tissue infiltrates the SA nodes and internodal atrial tracts, which may cause atrial fibrillation and flutter.\"], 'Cardiac output': [\"Cardiac output—the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle into the aorta each minute—is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume (the amount of blood the left ventricle ejects during each\\ncontraction) by the heart rate (number of beats/minute). When cellular demands increase, stroke volume or heart rate must increase. Many factors affect the heart rate, including exercise, pregnancy, and stress. When the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, the heart rate increases; when the parasympathetic system releases acetylcholine, it slows. As a person ages, the heart rate takes longer to normalize after exercise. Stroke volume depends on the ventricular blood volume and\\npressure at the end of diastole (preload), resistance to ejection (afterload), and the myocardium's contractile strength (inotropy). Changes in preload, afterload, or inotropic state can alter the stroke volume. ELDER TIP Exercise cardiac output declines slightly with age. A decrease in maximum heart rate and contractility may cause this change.\"], 'Circulation and pulses': [\"Blood circulates through three types of vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. The sturdy, pliable walls of the arteries adjust to the volume of blood\\nleaving the heart. The major artery branching out of the left ventricle\\nis the aorta. Its segments and subbranches ultimately divide into minute, thin- walled (one-cell thick) capillaries. Capillaries pass the blood to the veins, which return it to the heart. In the veins, valves prevent blood backflow. PULSE POINTS Peripheral pulse rhythm should correspond exactly to the auscultatory heart rhythm. The pulse's character may offer useful information. For example, pulsus alternans, a strong beat followed by a weak one, can mean myocardial weakness. A waterhammer (or Corrigan's )\\npulse, a forceful bounding pulse best felt in the carotid arteries or in the forearm, accompanies increased pulse pressure—commonly with capillary pulsations of the fingernails ( Quincke's sign ). This pulse usually indicates patent ductus or aortic insufficiency. Pulsus biferiens, a double peripheral pulse for every apical beat, can signal aortic stenosis, hyperthyroidism, or some other disease. Pulsus bigeminus is a coupled rhythm; you feel its beat in pairs. Pulsus paradoxus is exaggerated waxing and waning of the arterial pressure ( 15 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration). P ELDER TIP Aging contributes to arterial and venous insufficiency as the strength and elasticity of blood vessels decrease. Pulses are felt best wherever an artery runs near the skin and over a hard structure. (See Pulse points .) Easily found pulses are: radial artery— anterolateral aspect of the wrist temporal artery— in front of the ear, above and lateral to the eye common carotid artery— neck (side) femoral artery— groin. The lymphatic system also plays a role in the cardiovascular network. Originating in tissue spaces, the lymphatic system drains fluid and other plasma components that build up in extravascular spaces and P reroutes them back to the circulatory system as\\nlymph, a plasmalike fluid. Lymphatics also extract bacteria and foreign\\nbodies.\"], 'Cardiovascular assessment': [\"Physical assessment provides vital information about cardiovascular status. Check for underlying cardiovascular disorders, such as central cyanosis (impaired gas exchange), edema (heart failure or valvular disease), and clubbing (congenital cardiovascular disease). Palpate the peripheral pulses bilaterally and evaluate their rate, equality, and quality on a scale of 0 (absent) to +4 (bounding). (See Pulse amplitude scale. ) Inspect the carotid arteries for equal appearance. Auscultate for bruits; then palpate the arteries individually, one side at a time, for thrills (fine vibrations due to irregular blood flow). Check for pulsations in the jugular veins (more easily seen than felt). Watch for jugular vein distention—a possible sign of right-sided heart failure, valvular stenosis, cardiac tamponade, or pulmonary embolism. Take blood pressure readings in both arms while the patient is lying, sitting, and standing. Palpate the precordium for any abnormal pulsations, such as lifts, heaves, or thrills. Use the palms (at the base of the fingertips) or the fingertips. The normal apex will be felt as a light tap and extends over 1″ (2.5 cm) or less. Systematically auscultate the anterior chest wall for each of the four heart sounds in the aortic area (second intercostal space at the right sternal border), pulmonic area (second intercostal space at the left sternal border), right ventricular area (lower half of the left sternal border), and mitral area (fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line). However, don't limit your auscultation to these four areas. Valvular sounds may be heard all over the precordium. Therefore, inch your stethoscope in a Z pattern, from the base of the heart across and down and then over to the apex, or start at the apex and work your way up. For low-pitched sounds, use the bell of the stethoscope; for high-pitched sounds, the diaphragm. Carefully inspect each area for pulsations, and palpate for thrills. Check the location of apical pulsation for deviations in normal size (3/8″ to ¾″ [1 to 2 cm]) and position (in the mitral area)—possible signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, left-sided valvular disease, or right ventricular disease. Listen for the vibrating sound of turbulent blood flow through a stenotic or incompetent valve. Time the murmur to determine where it occurs in the cardiac cycle—between S 1 and S 2 (systolic), between S 2 and the following S 1 (diastolic), or throughout systole (holosystolic). Finally, listen for the scratching or squeaking of a pericardial friction rub. PULSE AMPLITUDE SCALE To record your patient's pulse amplitude, use this standard scale: 0: Pulse isn't palpable. +1: Pulse is thready, weak, difficult to find, may fade in and out, and disappears easily with pressure. +2: Pulse is constant but not strong; light pressure must be applied or pulse will disappear. +3: Pulse considered normal. Is easily palpable, doesn't disappear with pressure. +4: Pulse is strong, bounding, and doesn't disappear with pressure. POSITIONING CHEST ELECTRODES To record the 12-lead electrocardiogram, place electrodes\\non the patient's arms and legs (with the ground lead on the patient's right leg). The three standard limb leads (I, II, III) and the three augmented leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) are recorded using these electrodes. To record the precordial (chest) leads, place the electrodes as follows: V 1 —fourth intercostal space (ICS), right sternal border V 2 —fourth ICS, left sternal border V 3 —midway between V 2 and V 4 V 4 —fifth ICS, left midclavicular line V 5 —fifth ICS, left anterior axillary line V 6 —fifth ICS, left midaxillary line.\"], 'Special cardiovascular tests': [\"Electrocardiography (ECG) measures electrical activity by\\nrecording currents transmitted by the heart. It can detect ischemia, injury, necrosis, bundle-branch blocks, fascicular blocks, conduction delay, chamber enlargement, and arrhythmias. In Holter monitoring, a tape recording tracks as many as 100,000 cardiac cycles over a 12or 24-hour period. This test may be used to assess the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs or to evaluate arrhythmia symptoms. A signal-averaged ECG will identify afterpotentials, which are associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmias. (See Positioning chest electrodes. ) Chest X-rays may reveal cardiac enlargement and aortic dilation. They also assess pulmonary circulation. When pulmonary venous and arterial pressures rise, characteristic changes appear, such as dilation of the pulmonary venous shadows. When pulmonary venous pressure\\nexceeds oncotic pressure of the blood, capillary fluid leaks into lung tissues, causing pulmonary edema. This fluid may settle in the alveoli, producing a butterfly pattern, or the lungs may appear cloudy or hazy; in the interlobular septa, sharp linear densities (Kerley's lines) may appear. Exercise testing using a bicycle ergometer or treadmill determines the heart's response to physical stress. This test measures blood pressure and ECG changes during increasingly rigorous exercises. Myocardial ischemia, abnormal blood pressure response, P or arrhythmias indicate the circulatory system's failure to adapt to exercise. Cardiac catheterization evaluates chest pain, the need for coronary artery surgery or angioplasty, congenital heart defects, and valvular heart disease and determines the extent of heart failure. Right-sided catheterization involves threading a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter, which can measure cardiac output, through a vein into the right side of the heart, pulmonary artery, and its branches in the lungs to measure right atrial, right ventricular, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures. Left-sided catheterization entails retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle\\nor transseptal catheterization of the left atrium. Ventriculography during left-sided catheterization involves injecting radiopaque dye into\\nthe left ventricle to measure ejection fraction and to disclose abnormal heart wall motion or mitral valve incompetence. In coronary arteriography, radiopaque material injected into coronary arteries allows cineangiographic visualization of coronary\\narterial narrowing or occlusion. Digital subtraction angiography evaluates the coronary arteries through the use of X-ray images that are digitally subtracted by computer. Time-based color enhancement shows blood flow in nearby areas. Echocardiography uses echoes from pulsed high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to evaluate cardiac structures. Mmode echocardiography, in which a single, stationary ultrasound beam strikes the heart, produces a vertical view of cardiac structures. Two-dimensional echocardiography (most common), in which an ultrasound beam rapidly sweeps through an arc, produces a cross-sectional or fan-shaped view of cardiac structures. Both M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography may use contrast agents for enhancement. Doppler echocardiography records blood flow within the cardiovascular system. Color Doppler echocardiography shows the direction of blood flow, which provides information about the degree of valvular insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiography combines ultrasound with endoscopy to better view the heart's structures. This procedure allows images to be taken from the heart's posterior aspect. Echocardiography provides information about valve leaflets, size and dimensions of heart chambers, and thickness and motion of the septum and the ventricular walls. It can also reveal intracardiac masses, detect pericardial effusion, diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and estimate cardiac output and ejection fraction. This test can also evaluate possible aortic dissection when it involves the ascending aorta. In multiple-gated acquisition scanning, a radioactive isotope in the intravascular compartment allows measurement of stroke volume, wall motion, and ventricular ejection fraction. Myocardial imaging usually uses the radioactive agent thallium201 or Tc-99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) to detect abnormalities in myocardial perfusion. This agent concentrates in normally perfused areas of the myocardium but\\nnot in ischemic areas (“cold spots”), which may be permanent (scar tissue) or temporary (from transient ischemia). These tests can be done as exercise studies or can be combined with drugs, such as adenosine or Persantine, in patients unable to exercise. Acute infarct imaging documents muscle viability (not perfusion) through the use of technetium- labeled pyrophosphate. Unlike thallium, technetium accumulates only in irreversibly damaged myocardial\\ntissue. Areas of necrosis appear as “hot spots” and can be detected only during an acute myocardial infarction (MI). This test determines the size and location of an infarction but can produce false results.\"], 'Blood tests': [\"Cardiac enzymes (cellular proteins released into blood after cell membrane injury) confirm acute MI or severe cardiac trauma. All cardiac enzymes—creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase, for example—are also found in other cells. Fractionation of enzymes can determine the source of damaged cells. For example, three fractions of CK are isolated, one of which P (an isoenzyme called CK-MB ) is found only in cardiac cells. CK-MB in the blood indicates injury to myocardial cells. Measurement of a cardiac protein called troponin is the most precise way to determine if a patient has experienced an MI. Some 6 hours after an MI, a blood test can detect two forms of troponin: T and I. Troponin T levels peak about 2 days after an MI and return to normal about 16 days later. Troponin I levels reach their peak\\nin less than 1 day after an MI and return to normal in about 7 days. Peripheral arteriography consists of a fluoroscopic X-ray\\nafter arterial injection of a contrast medium. Similarly, phlebography defines the venous system after injection of a contrast medium into a vein. Impedance plethysmography evaluates the venous system to detect pressure changes transmitted to lower leg veins. Doppler ultrasonography evaluates the peripheral vascular\\nsystem and assesses peripheral artery disease when combined with sequential systolic blood pressure readings. Endomyocardial biopsy can detect cardiomyopathy, infiltrative myocardial diseases, and transplant rejection. Electrophysiologic studies help diagnose conduction system disease and serious arrhythmias. Electronic induction and termination of arrhythmias aid drug selection. Endocardial mapping detects an arrhythmia's focus using a finger electrode. Epicardial mapping uses a computer and a fabric sock with electrodes that's slipped\\nover the heart to detect arrhythmias. Magnetic resonance imaging can investigate cardiac structure and function. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are used to assess myocardial metabolism. Electron beam computed tomography, also known as ultrafast computed tomography, is used to detect microcalcifications in the coronary arteries. This test is useful for identifying early coronary artery disease.\"], 'Managing cardiovascular disease': ['Patients with cardiovascular disease pose a tremendous challenge. Their sheer numbers alone compel a thorough understanding of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Anticipate a high anxiety level in cardiac patients, and provide support and reassurance, especially during procedures such as cardiac catheterization. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are widely prescribed and\\noffer education and support along with exercise instruction. Rehabilitation programs begin in health care facilities and continue on an outpatient basis. Helping the patient resume a satisfying lifestyle requires planning and comprehensive teaching. Inform the patient about health care facilities and organizations that offer cardiac rehabilitation programs. CONGENITAL ACYANOTIC DEFECTS'], 'Ventricular septal defect': ['In ventricular septal defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart disorder, an opening in the septum between the ventricles allows blood to shunt between the left and right ventricles. This disease accounts for up to 30% of all congenital heart defects. The\\nprognosis is good for defects that close spontaneously or are correctable surgically but poor for untreated defects, which are sometimes fatal by age 1, usually from secondary complications.'], 'Causes and incidence': [\"In neonates with VSD, the ventricular septum fails to close completely by the eighth week of gestation, as it would normally. VSD occurs in some neonates with fetal alcohol syndrome, but a P causal relationship hasn't been established. Although most children with congenital heart defects are otherwise normal, in some, VSD coexists with additional birth defects, especially Down syndrome and other autosomal trisomies, renal anomalies, and such cardiac defects as patent\\nductus arteriosus and coarctation of the aorta. VSDs are located in the\\nmembranous or muscular portion of the ventricular septum and vary in size. Some defects close spontaneously; in other defects, the entire septum is absent, creating a single ventricle. VSD isn't readily apparent at birth, because right and left ventricular pressures are about equal, so blood doesn't shunt through the defect. As the pulmonary vasculature gradually relaxes, 4 to\\n8 weeks after birth, right ventricular pressure decreases, allowing blood to shunt from the left to the right ventricle. Less than 1% of neonates are born with VSD. In 80% to 90%\\nof neonates who are born with this disorder, the hole is small and will\\nusually close spontaneously. In the remaining 10% to 20% of neonates, surgery is needed to close the hole.\", 'The cause of ASD is unknown. In this condition, blood shunts from left to right because left atrial pressure normally is slightly higher than right atrial pressure; this pressure difference forces large amounts of blood through a defect. The left-to-right shunt results in right heart volume overload, affecting the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary arteries. Eventually, the right atrium enlarges, and the right ventricle dilates to accommodate the increased blood volume. If pulmonary artery hypertension develops because of the shunt (rare in children), increased pulmonary vascular P resistance and right ventricular hypertrophy will follow. In some adult patients, irreversible (fixed) pulmonary artery hypertension causes reversal of the shunt direction, which results in unoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation, causing cyanosis. ASD is present in 4 of every 100,000 people. Symptoms usually develop before age 30. When no other congenital defect exists, the patient—especially children— may be asymptomatic.', \"Coarctation of the aorta may develop as a result of spasm\\nand constriction of the smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus as it closes. Possibly, this contractile tissue extends into the aortic wall, causing narrowing. The obstructive process causes hypertension in the aortic branches above the constriction (arteries that supply the arms, neck, and head) and diminished pressure in the vessels below the constriction. Restricted blood flow through the narrowed aorta increases the pressure load on the left ventricle and causes dilation of\\nthe proximal aorta and ventricular hypertrophy. Untreated, this condition may lead to left-sided heart failure and, rarely, to cerebral hemorrhage and aortic rupture. If ventricular septal defect accompanies coarctation, blood shunts left to right, straining the right side of the heart. This leads to pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, right-sided heart hypertrophy and failure. Coarctation of the aorta occurs in 1 of every 10,000 people and is usually diagnosed in children or adults younger than age 40. It accounts for about 7% of all congenital heart defects in children\\nand is twice as common in males as in females. When it occurs in females, it's commonly associated with Turner's syndrome, a chromosomal disorder that causes ovarian dysgenesis.\", 'Normally, the ductus closes within days to weeks after birth. Failure to close is most prevalent in premature neonates, probably as a result of abnormalities in oxygenation or the relaxant action of prostaglandin E, which prevents ductal spasm and contracture necessary for closure. PDA commonly accompanies rubella syndrome and may\\nbe associated with other congenital defects, such as coarctation of the\\naorta, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary and aortic stenoses. In PDA, relative resistances in pulmonary and systemic vasculature and the size of the ductus determine the amount of left-to-right shunting. The left atrium and left ventricle must accommodate the increased pulmonary venous return, in turn increasing filling pressure and workload on the left side of the heart and possibly\\ncausing heart failure. In the final stages of untreated PDA, the left-to- right shunt leads to chronic pulmonary artery hypertension that becomes fixed and unreactive. This causes the shunt to reverse; unoxygenated blood thus enters systemic circulation, causing cyanosis. PDA is found in 1 of every 2,500 to 5,000 infants and is the most common congenital heart defect found in adults. It affects twice as many females as males. P', 'The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, but it results from embryologic hypoplasia of the outflow tract of the right ventricle. Multiple factors, such as Down syndrome, have been associated\\nwith its presence. Prenatal risk factors include maternal rubella or other viral illnesses, poor prenatal nutrition, maternal alcoholism, mother older than age 40, and diabetes. Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in about 5 of every 10,000 infants and accounts for about 10% of all congenital heart diseases. It occurs equally in boys and girls. Before surgical advances made correction possible, about one-third of these children died in infancy.', 'Transposition of the great arteries results from faulty embryonic development, but the cause of such development is unknown. In transposition, oxygenated blood returning to the left side of the heart is P carried back to the lungs by a transposed pulmonary artery; unoxygenated blood returning to the right side of the heart is carried to the systemic circulation by a transposed aorta. Communication between the pulmonary and systemic circulations is necessary for survival. In infants with isolated transposition, blood mixes only at the patent foramen ovale and at the PDA, resulting in slight mixing of unoxygenated systemic blood and oxygenated pulmonary blood. In infants with concurrent cardiac defects, greater mixing of blood occurs. Transposition of the great arteries occurs in about 40 of every 100,000 infants.', \"Myocarditis may result from: bacterial infections—diphtheria; tuberculosis; typhoid fever; tetanus; and staphylococcal, pneumococcal, and gonococcal infections chemical poisons—such as chronic alcoholism helminthic infections—such as trichinosis hypersensitive immune reactions—acute rheumatic fever and postcardiotomy syndrome parasitic infections—especially South American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) in infants and immunosuppressed adults; also toxoplasmosis radiation therapy—large doses of radiation to the chest in treating lung or breast cancer viral infections (most common cause in the\\nUnited States and western Europe)— coxsackievirus A and B strains and, possibly, poliomyelitis, influenza, rubeola, rubella, and adenoviruses and echoviruses. Myocarditis occurs in 1 to 10 of every 100,000 people in the United States. The median age for this disorder is 42, and incidence\\nis equal between males and females. Children, especially neonates, and persons who are immunocompromised or pregnant (especially pregnant black\\nwomen) are at higher risk for developing this disorder.\", \"Most cases of endocarditis occur in I.V. drug abusers, patients with prosthetic heart valves, and those with mitral valve prolapse (especially males with a systolic murmur). These conditions have surpassed rheumatic heart disease as the leading risk factor. Other\\npredisposing conditions include coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, subaortic and valvular aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defects, pulmonary stenosis, Marfan syndrome, degenerative heart disease\\n(especially calcific aortic stenosis) and, rarely, syphilitic aortic valve. However, some patients with endocarditis have no underlying heart disease. Infecting organisms differ among these groups. In patients with native valve endocarditis who aren't I.V. drug abusers, causative organisms usually include—in order of frequency—streptococci (especially Streptococcus viridans), staphylococci, or enterococci. Although many other bacteria occasionally cause the disorder, fungal causes are rare in this group. The mitral valve is involved most commonly, followed by the aortic valve. P In patients who are I.V. drug abusers, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism. Less commonly, streptococci, enterococci, gram-negative bacilli, or fungi cause the disorder. The tricuspid valve is involved most commonly, followed by the aortic and then the mitral valve. In patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, early cases (those that develop within 60 days of valve insertion) are usually\\ndue to staphylococcal infection. However, gram-negative aerobic organisms, fungi, streptococci, enterococci, or diphtheroids may also cause the disorder. The course is usually fulminant and is associated with a high mortality. Late cases (occurring after 60 days) present similarly to native valve endocarditis. In the United States, endocarditis affects 1.4 to 4.2 people out of every 100,000. Males are twice as likely as females to acquire this infection, and the mean age of onset is 50. Mortality is associated with increased age, infection of the aortic valve, heart failure and underlying heart disease, and central nervous system complications; mortality rates vary with the infecting organism.\", \"Common causes of this disease include: bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (infectious pericarditis) neoplasms (primary or metastatic from lungs, breasts, or other organs) high-dose radiation to the chest uremia hypersensitivity or autoimmune disease, such as acute rheumatic fever (most common cause of pericarditis in children), systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis postcardiac injury such as myocardial infarction (MI), which later causes an autoimmune reaction (Dressler's syndrome) in the pericardium; trauma; or surgery that leaves the pericardium intact but causes blood to leak into the pericardial cavity drugs, such as hydralazine or procainamide idiopathic factors (most common in acute pericarditis). Less common causes include aortic aneurysm with pericardial leakage, and myxedema with cholesterol deposits in the pericardium. Pericarditis most commonly affects men ages 20 to 50, but\\nit can also occur in children following infection with an adenovirus or\\ncoxsackievirus.\", \"Rheumatic fever appears to be a hypersensitivity reaction\\nto a group A betahemolytic streptococcal infection, in which antibodies\\nmanufactured to combat streptococci react and produce characteristic lesions at specific tissue sites, especially in the heart and joints. Because very few persons (3%) with streptococcal infections ever contract rheumatic fever, altered host resistance must be involved in its development or recurrence. Although rheumatic fever tends to be familial, this may merely reflect contributing environmental factors. For example, in lower socioeconomic groups, incidence is highest in children between ages 5 and 15, probably as a result of malnutrition and\\ncrowded living conditions. This disease strikes generally during cool, damp weather in the winter and early spring. In the United States, it's most common in the northern states.\", \"Hypertension affects 25% of adults in the United States. If untreated, it carries a high mortality. Risk factors for hypertension\\ninclude family history, race (most common in blacks), stress, obesity, a\\ndiet high in saturated fats or sodium, tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, and aging. Secondary hypertension may result from renal vascular disease; pheochromocytoma; primary hyperaldosteronism; Cushing's syndrome; thyroid, pituitary, or parathyroid dysfunction; coarctation of the aorta; pregnancy; neurologic disorders; and use of hormonal contraceptives or other drugs, such as cocaine, epoetin alfa (erythropoietin), and cyclosporine. Cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance determine blood pressure. Increased blood volume, cardiac rate, and stroke volume as well as arteriolar vasoconstriction can raise blood pressure. The link to sustained hypertension, however, is unclear. Hypertension may also result from failure of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms: Renal hypoperfusion causes release of renin, which is converted by angiotensinogen, a liver enzyme, to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor. The resulting vasoconstriction increases afterload. Angiotensin II stimulates adrenal secretion of aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption. Hypertonic-stimulated release of antidiuretic hormone from the pituitary gland follows, increasing water reabsorption, plasma volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Autoregulation changes an artery's diameter to maintain perfusion despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. The intrinsic mechanisms responsible include stress relaxation\\n(vessels gradually dilate when blood pressure rises to reduce peripheral resistance) and capillary fluid shift (plasma moves between vessels and extravascular spaces to maintain intravascular volume). When the blood pressure drops, baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses decrease their inhibition of the medulla's vasomotor center, which increases sympathetic stimulation of the heart by norepinephrine. This, in turn, increases cardiac output by strengthening the contractile force, increasing the heart rate, and augmenting peripheral resistance by vasoconstriction. Stress can also stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to increase cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.\", 'Atherosclerosis is the usual cause of CAD. In this form of arteriosclerosis, fatty, fibrous plaques, possibly including calcium deposits, narrow the lumen of the coronary arteries, reduce the volume of blood that can flow through them, and lead to myocardial ischemia. Plaque formation also predisposes to thrombosis, which can provoke myocardial infarction (MI). Atherosclerosis usually develops in highflow, high-pressure arteries, such as those in the heart, brain, kidneys, and in the aorta, especially at bifurcation points. It has been linked to many risk factors: family history, male gender, age (risk increased in those aged 65 or older), hypertension, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, stress, sedentary lifestyle, high serum cholesterol (particularly high low- density lipoprotein cholesterol) or triglyceride levels, low highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels, high blood homocysteine levels, menopause and, possibly, infections producing inflammatory responses in the artery walls. Uncommon causes of reduced coronary artery blood flow include dissecting aneurysms, infectious vasculitis, syphilis, and congenital defects in the coronary vascular system. Coronary artery spasms may also impede blood flow. (See Coronary artery spasm. ) Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, someone in the United States suffers a coronary heart event approximately every 29 seconds, and someone dies from such an event about every 60 seconds.', 'Predisposing risk factors include: diabetes mellitus drug use, especially cocaine elevated serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein levels hypertension obesity or excessive intake of saturated fats, carbohydrates, or salt positive family history sedentary lifestyle smoking stress or a type A personality. The site of the MI depends on the vessels involved. Occlusion of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery causes a lateral wall infarction; occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, an anterior wall infarction. True posterior or\\ninferior wall infarctions generally result from occlusion of the right coronary artery or one of its branches. Right ventricular infarctions can also result from right coronary artery occlusion, can accompany inferior infarctions, and may cause right-sided heart failure. In Q-wave\\n(transmural) MI, tissue damage extends through all myocardial layers; in non-Qwave (subendocardial) MI, only in the innermost and possibly the\\nmiddle layers. P Incidence is high: About 1 million patients visit the hospital each year with an MI and another 200,000 to 300,000 people die from MI-related complications without seeking medical care. Men and postmenopausal women are more susceptible to MI than premenopausal women, although incidence is rising among females, especially those who smoke and take hormonal contraceptives.', \"Heart failure may result from a primary abnormality of the heart muscle such as an infarction, inadequate myocardial perfusion due to coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy. Other causes include: P diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction, impairment of ventricular filling by diminished relaxation or reduced compliance seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial hypertrophy, and pericardial restriction mechanical disturbances in ventricular filling during diastole when there's too little blood for the ventricle to pump, as in mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease or constrictive pericarditis and atrial fibrillation systolic hemodynamic disturbances, such as\\nexcessive cardiac workload due to volume overloading or pressure overload that limit the heart's pumping ability. These disturbances can result from mitral or aortic insufficiency, which causes volume overloading, and aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension, which result in increased resistance to ventricular emptying. Reduced cardiac output triggers compensatory mechanisms, such as ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, increased sympathetic activity, and activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system. These mechanisms improve cardiac output at the expense of increased ventricular work. In cardiac dilation, an increase in end-diastolic ventricular volume (preload) causes increased stroke work and stroke volume during contraction, stretching cardiac muscle fibers beyond optimum limits and producing pulmonary congestion and pulmonary hypertension, which in turn lead to right-sided heart failure. In ventricular hypertrophy, an increase in muscle mass or\\ndiameter of the left ventricle allows the heart to pump against increased resistance (impedance) to the outflow of blood. An increase in ventricular diastolic pressure necessary to fill the enlarged ventricle\\nmay compromise diastolic coronary blood flow, limiting the oxygen supply to the ventricle and causing ischemia and impaired muscle contractility. Increased sympathetic activity occurs as a response to decreased cardiac output and blood pressure by enhancing peripheral vascular resistance, contractility, heart rate, and venous return. Signs\\nof increased sympathetic activity, such as cool extremities and clamminess, may indicate impending heart failure. Increased sympathetic activity also restricts blood flow to the kidneys, which respond by reducing the glomerular filtration rate and increasing tubular reabsorption of salt and water, in turn expanding the circulating blood volume. This renal mechanism, if unchecked, can aggravate congestion and\\nproduce overt edema. Chronic heart failure may worsen as a result of respiratory tract infections, pulmonary embolism, stress, increased sodium or water intake, or failure to adhere to the prescribed treatment\\nregimen. Heart failure affects about 2 of every 100 people between ages 27 and 74. It becomes more common with advancing age.\", \"The cause of most cardiomyopathies is unknown. Occasionally, dilated cardiomyopathy results from myocardial destruction\\nby toxic, infectious, or metabolic agents, such as certain viruses, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and nutritional deficiencies. Other\\ncauses include muscle disorders (myasthenia gravis, progressive muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy), infiltrative disorders (hemochromatosis and amyloidosis), and sarcoidosis. Cardiomyopathy may also be a complication of alcoholism. In such cases, it may improve with abstinence from alcohol but recurs when the patient resumes drinking. How viruses induce cardiomyopathy is unclear, but researchers suspect a link between viral myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy, especially after infection with poliovirus, coxsackievirus B, influenza virus, or human immunodeficiency virus. Metabolic cardiomyopathies are related to endocrine and electrolyte disorders and nutritional deficiencies. Thus, dilated cardiomyopathy may develop in patients with hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, beriberi (thiamine deficiency), or kwashiorkor (protein deficiency). Cardiomyopathy may also result from rheumatic fever, especially among children with myocarditis. Antepartal or postpartal cardiomyopathy may develop during the last trimester or within months after delivery. Its cause is unknown, but it occurs most frequently in multiparous women older than age 30, particularly those with malnutrition or preeclampsia. In these patients, cardiomegaly and heart failure may reverse with treatment, allowing a subsequent normal pregnancy. If cardiomegaly persists despite\\ntreatment, the prognosis is poor. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in 2 of every 100 people and affects all ages and sexes. It's most common in adult men.\", 'Despite being designated as idiopathic, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be inherited as a non-sex- linked autosomal dominant trait in almost all cases. Most patients have obstructive disease, resulting from effects of ventricular septal hypertrophy and the movement of the anterior mitral valve leaflet into the outflow tract during systole. Eventually, left ventricular dysfunction, from rigidity and decreased compliance, causes pump failure. This disorder affects 2 to 5 of every 1,000 people and is\\nusually the cause of sudden death, particularly in otherwise healthy athletes.', 'Hypovolemic shock usually results from acute blood loss—about one-fifth of total volume. Such massive blood loss may result\\nfrom GI bleeding, internal hemorrhage (hemothorax and hemoperitoneum), external hemorrhage (accidental or surgical trauma), or from any condition that reduces circulating intravascular plasma volume or other body fluids such as in severe burns. Other underlying causes of hypovolemic shock include intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, ascites and dehydration from excessive perspiration, severe diarrhea or protracted vomiting, diabetes insipidus, diuresis, or\\ninadequate fluid intake.', 'Cardiogenic shock can result from any condition that causes significant left ventricular dysfunction with reduced cardiac output, such as MI (most common), myocardial ischemia, papillary muscle dysfunction, or end-stage cardiomyopathy. Regardless of the underlying cause, left ventricular dysfunction sets into motion a series of compensatory mechanisms that attempt to increase cardiac output and, in turn, maintain vital organ function. (See What happens in cardiogenic shock. )\\nAs cardiac output falls in left ventricular dysfunction, aortic and carotid baroreceptors initiate sympathetic nervous responses, which increase heart rate, left ventricular filling pressure, and peripheral resistance to flow, to enhance venous return to the heart. These compensatory responses initially stabilize the patient but later cause deterioration with rising oxygen demands of the already compromised myocardium. These events comprise a vicious circle of low cardiac output, sympathetic compensation, myocardial ischemia, and even lower cardiac output. Incidence of cardiogenic shock is higher in men than in women because of their higher incidence of coronary artery disease. However, among people with MI, women have a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock than men.', 'When MI destroys a large muscular section of the left ventricle, necrosis reduces the ventricular wall to a thin sheath of fibrous tissue. Under intracardiac pressure, this thin layer stretches and forms a separate noncontractile sac (aneurysm). Abnormal muscular wall movement accompanies ventricular aneurysm and includes akinesia (lack of movement), dyskinesia (paradoxical movement), asynergia (decreased and inadequate movement), and asynchrony (uncoordinated movement). During systolic ejection, the abnormal muscular wall movements associated with the aneurysm cause the remaining normally functioning myocardial fibers to increase the force of contraction in order to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output. At the same time, a portion of the stroke volume is lost to passive distention of the noncontractile sac.', \"Increased intrapericardial pressure and cardiac tamponade may be idiopathic (Dressler's syndrome) or may result from: effusion (in cancer, bacterial infections, tuberculosis and, rarely, acute rheumatic fever) hemorrhage from trauma (such as gunshot or\\nstab wounds of the chest and perforation by catheter during cardiac or central venous catheterization or postcardiac surgery) hemorrhage from nontraumatic causes (such as rupture of the heart or great vessels or anticoagulant therapy in a patient with pericarditis) acute myocardial infarction (MI) end stage lung cancer heart tumors radiation therapy hypothyroidism systemic lupus erythematosus uremia. Cardiac tamponade occurs in 2 of every 10,000 people.\", 'Arrhythmias may be congenital or they may result from one\\nof several factors, including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, or organic heart disease. Drug ingestion (cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine, beta-blockers, psychotropics, sympathomimetics),\\ndrug toxicity, or degeneration of the conductive tissue necessary to maintain normal heart rhythm (sick sinus syndrome) can sometimes precipitate arrhythmias. People with imbalances of blood chemistries or those with a history of cardiac conditions (coronary artery disease or heart valve disorders) are at higher risk for developing arrhythmias.', 'Thoracic aortic aneurysms commonly result from atherosclerosis, which weakens the aortic wall and gradually distends the lumen. An intimal tear in the ascending aorta initiates dissecting aneurysm in about 60% of the patients. Regardless of causation, these aneurysms affect 6 out of every 100,000 people. ELDER TIP Ascending aortic aneurysms, the most\\ncommon type, are usually seen in hypertensive men younger than age 60. Descending aortic aneurysms, usually found just below the origin of the subclavian artery, are most common in elderly men who are hypertensive. Descending aortic aneurysms are also seen in younger patients with a history of traumatic chest injury; less often in those with infection. Transverse aortic aneurysms are the least common type. Other causes include: fungal infection (mycotic aneurysms) of the aortic arch and descending segments congenital disorders, such as coarctation of the aorta and Marfan syndrome trauma, usually of the descending thoracic\\naorta, from an accident that shears the aorta transversely (accelerationdeceleration injuries) syphilis, usually of the ascending aorta (uncommon because of antibiotics) hypertension (in dissecting aneurysm).', 'Abdominal aortic aneurysms result from arteriosclerosis, hypertension, congenital weakening, cystic medial necrosis, trauma, syphilis, and other infections. In children, this disorder can result from blunt abdominal injury or Marfan syndrome. These aneurysms develop slowly. First, a focal weakness in the muscular layer of the aorta (tunica media), due to degenerative changes, allows the inner layer (tunica intima) and outer layer (tunica adventitia) to stretch outward. Blood pressure within the aorta progressively weakens the vessel walls and enlarges the aneurysm. This disorder is four times more common in men than in women and is most prevalent in whites ages 40 to 70. Less than 50% of people with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm survive.', 'Femoral and popliteal aneurysms are usually secondary to atherosclerosis. Rarely, they result from congenital weakness in the arterial wall. They may also result from trauma (blunt or penetrating), bacterial infection, or peripheral vascular reconstructive surgery (which causes “suture line” aneurysms, or false aneurysms, in which a blood clot forms a second lumen).', \"A thrombus occurs when an alteration in the epithelial lining causes platelet aggregation and consequent fibrin entrapment of red and white blood cells and additional platelets. Thrombus formation is more rapid in areas where blood flow is slower, due to greater contact between platelet and thrombin accumulation. The rapidly expanding thrombus initiates a chemical inflammatory process in the vessel epithelium, which leads to fibrosis. The enlarging clot may occlude the vessel lumen partially or totally, or it may detach and embolize to lodge elsewhere in the systemic circulation. ARTERIES OF THE LEG FRONT VIEW BACK VIEW P CHRONIC VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY Chronic venous insufficiency results from the valvular destruction of deep vein thrombophlebitis, usually in the iliac and femoral veins, and occasionally the saphenous veins. It's often accompanied by incompetence of the communicating veins at the ankle, causing increased venous pressure and fluid migration into the interstitial tissue. Clinical effects include chronic swelling of the affected leg from edema, leading to tissue fibrosis, and induration; skin discoloration from extravasation of blood in subcutaneous tissue; and stasis ulcers around the ankle. Treatment of small ulcers includes bed rest, elevation of\\nthe legs, warm soaks, and antimicrobial therapy for infection. Treatment to counteract increased venous pressure, the result of reflux from the deep venous system to surface veins, may include compression dressings, such as a sponge rubber pressure P dressing or a zinc gelatin boot (Unna's boot). This therapy begins after massive swelling subsides with leg elevation and bed rest. Large stasis ulcers unresponsive to conservative treatment may require excision and skin grafting. Patient care includes daily inspection to assess healing. Other care measures are the same as for varicose veins. DVT may be idiopathic, but it usually results from endothelial damage, accelerated blood clotting, and reduced blood flow known as Virchow's triad. Predisposing factors are prolonged bed rest, trauma, surgery, childbirth, and use of hormonal contraceptives such as estrogens. It occurs in about 80 of every 100,000 people; 1 of every 20 persons is affected at some point during his lifetime. Males are at slightly greater risk than females. People older than age 40 are also at\\nincreased risk. Causes of superficial thrombophlebitis include trauma, infection, I.V. drug abuse, and chemical irritation due to extensive use\\nof the I.V. route for medications and diagnostic tests.\", \"Although the cause is unknown, several theories account for the reduced digital blood flow: intrinsic vascular wall hyperactivity to cold, increased vasomotor tone due to sympathetic stimulation, and antigen-antibody immune response (the most likely theory because abnormal immunologic test results accompany Raynaud's phenomenon). Risk factors include associated diseases (Buerger's disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and SLE) and smoking. This disorder affects females more often than males.\", \"Buerger's disease is caused by vasculitis, an inflammation of blood vessels, primarily of the hands and feet. The vessels become constricted or totally blocked, reducing blood flow to the tissues and resulting in pain and, eventually, damage. This disorder occurs in 6 of every 10,000 people. Incidence is highest among males ages 20 to 40 who have a history of smoking or chewing tobacco. It may be associated with a history of Raynaud's disease and may occur in people with autoimmune disease.\", 'Peripheral artery disease is a common complication of atherosclerosis. The occlusive mechanism may be endogenous, due to emboli formation or thrombosis, or exogenous, due to trauma or fracture. Predisposing factors include smoking; aging; such conditions as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; and a family history of vascular disorders, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Peripheral artery disease has no racial predilection. Men\\nolder than 50 are at increased risk for intermittent claudication, a common sign of peripheral artery disease.'], 'Complications': ['Right arterial and ventricular hypertrophy Heart failure Pulmonary hypertension', 'Unoxygenated blood in systemic circulation Right and left ventricular hypertrophy Atrial arrhythmias Heart failure Emboli', 'Infective endocarditis Pulmonary hypertension Right ventricular hypertrophy Right-sided heart failure', 'Left-sided heart failure Pulmonary artery hypertension Respiratory distress (children)', 'P Cerebral abscess Pulmonary thrombosis Venous thrombosis Cerebral embolism Infective endocarditis', 'Chronic heart failure Poor oxygenation Arrhythmias Right-sided heart failure', 'Arrhythmias Thromboembolism Chronic valvulitis (when disease results from rheumatic fever) Recurrence of disease Left-sided heart failure (occasional) Cardiomyopathy (rare)', 'Left-sided heart failure Valvular stenosis or insufficiency Myocardial erosion', 'Pericardial effusion P Cardiac tamponade Shock Cardiovascular collapse Death PATTERNS OF CARDIAC PAIN Although pain perception is individualistic, specific characteristics are associated with different types of cardiac pain, as shown below.

In a small VSD, shunting is minimal, and pulmonary artery pressure and heart size remain normal. Such defects may eventually close spontaneously without ever causing symptoms. Initially, large VSD shunts cause left atrial and left ventricular hypertrophy. Later, an uncorrected VSD will cause right ventricular hypertrophy due to increasing pulmonary vascular resistance.\\nEventually, biventricular heart failure and cyanosis (from reversal of shunt direction) occur. Resulting cardiac hypertrophy may make the anterior chest wall prominent. A large VSD increases the risk of pneumonia. Infants with large VSDs are thin and small and gain weight slowly. They may develop heart failure with dusky skin; liver, heart, and spleen enlargement because of systemic venous congestion; diaphoresis; feeding difficulties; rapid, grunting respirations; and increased heart rate. They may also develop severe pulmonary hypertension. Fixed pulmonary hypertension may occur much later in life with right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger's syndrome), causing cyanosis and clubbing of the nail beds. The typical murmur associated with a VSD is blowing or rumbling and varies in frequency. In the neonate, a moderately loud early systolic murmur may be heard along the lower left sternal border. About the second or third day after birth, the murmur may become louder and longer. In infants, the murmur may be loudest near the heart's base and may suggest pulmonary stenosis. A small VSD may produce a functional\\nmurmur or a characteristic loud, harsh systolic murmur. Larger VSDs produce audible murmurs (at least a grade 3 pansystolic), loudest at the\\nfourth intercostal space, usually with a thrill; however, a large VSD with minimal pressure gradient may have no audible murmur. In addition, the pulmonic component of S 2 sounds loud and is widely split.\\nPalpation reveals displacement of the point of maximal impulse to the left. When fixed pulmonary hypertension is present, a diastolic murmur may be audible on auscultation, the systolic murmur becomes quieter, and\\nS 2 is greatly accentuated.\", \"ASD commonly goes undetected in preschoolers; such children may complain about feeling tired only after extreme exertion and may have frequent respiratory tract infections but otherwise appear normal and healthy. However, they may show growth retardation if they have large shunts. Children with ASD seldom develop heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis, or other complications. However, as adults, they usually manifest pronounced symptoms, such as fatigability and dyspnea on exertion, frequently to the point of severe limitation of activity (especially after age 40). In children, auscultation reveals an early to midsystolic\\nmurmur, superficial in quality, heard at the second or third left intercostal space. In patients with large shunts (resulting from increased tricuspid valve flow), a low-pitched diastolic murmur is heard\\nat the lower left sternal border, which becomes more pronounced on inspiration. Although the murmur's intensity is a rough indicator of the\\nsize of the left-to-right shunt, its low pitch sometimes makes it difficult to hear and, if the pressure gradient is relatively low, a murmur may not be detectable. Other signs include a fixed, widely split S 2 ,\\ncaused by delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, and a systolic click or late systolic murmur at the apex, resulting from mitral valve prolapse, which occasionally affects older children with ASD. In older patients with large, uncorrected defects and fixed pulmonary artery hypertension, auscultation reveals an accentuated S 2 . A pulmonary ejection click and an audible S 4 may also be present. Clubbing and cyanosis become evident; syncope and hemoptysis may occur with severe pulmonary vascular disease.\", 'Clinical features vary with age. During the first year of\\nlife, when aortic coarctation may cause heart failure, the infant displays tachypnea, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, pallor, tachycardia, failure to thrive, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly. In most cases, heart sounds are normal unless a coexisting cardiac defect is present. Femoral\\npulses are absent or diminished. If coarctation is asymptomatic in infancy, it usually remains so throughout adolescence, as collateral circulation develops to\\nbypass the narrowed segment. During adolescence, this defect may produce dyspnea, claudication, headaches, epistaxis, and hypertension in\\nthe upper extremities despite collateral circulation. It commonly causes resting systolic hypertension and wide pulse pressure; high diastolic pressure readings are the same in both the arms and legs. Coarctation may also produce a visible aortic pulsation in the suprasternal notch, a continuous systolic murmur, an accentuated S 2 , and an S 4 .', \"In neonates, especially those who are premature, a large PDA usually produces respiratory distress, with signs of heart failure due to the tremendous volume of blood shunted to the lungs through a patent ductus and the increased workload on the left side of the heart. Other characteristic features may include heightened susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, slow motor development, and failure to thrive. Most children with PDA have no symptoms except cardiac ones. Others may exhibit signs of heart disease, such as physical underdevelopment, fatigability, and frequent respiratory tract infections. Adults with undetected PDA may develop pulmonary vascular disease and, by age 40, may display fatigability and dyspnea on exertion. About 10% of them also develop infective endocarditis. Auscultation reveals the classic machinery murmur (Gibson\\nmurmur): a continuous murmur (during systole and diastole) best heard at the heart's base, at the second left intercostal space under the left clavicle in 85% of children with PDA. This murmur may obscure S 2 .\\nHowever, with a right-to-left shunt, such a murmur may be absent. Palpation may reveal a thrill at the left sternal border and a prominent\\nleft ventricular impulse. Peripheral arterial pulses are bounding (Corrigan's\\npulse); pulse pressure is widened because of an elevation in systolic blood pressure and, primarily, a drop in diastolic pressure.\", \"The degree of pulmonary stenosis, interacting with the VSD's size and location, determines the clinical and hemodynamic effects\\nof this complex defect. The VSD usually lies in the outflow tract of the right ventricle and is generally large enough to permit equalization\\nof right and left ventricular pressures. However, the ratio of systemic\\nvascular resistance to pulmonary stenosis affects the direction and magnitude of shunt flow across the VSD. Severe obstruction of right ventricular outflow produces a right-to-left shunt, causing decreased systemic arterial oxygen saturation, cyanosis, reduced pulmonary blood flow, and hypoplasia of the entire pulmonary vasculature. Increased right ventricular pressure causes right ventricular hypertrophy. Milder forms of pulmonary stenosis result in a left-to-right shunt or no shunt at all. Generally, the hallmark of the disorder is cyanosis, which usually becomes evident within several months after birth but may be present at birth if the neonate has severe pulmonary stenosis. Between ages 2 months and 2 years, children with tetralogy of Fallot may\\nexperience cyanotic or “blue” spells. Such spells result from increased\\nright-to-left shunting, possibly caused by spasm of the right ventricular outflow tract, increased systemic venous return, or decreased systemic arterial resistance. Exercise, crying, straining, infection, or fever can precipitate blue spells. Blue spells are characterized by dyspnea; deep,\\nsighing respirations; bradycardia; fainting; seizures; and loss of consciousness. Older children may also develop other signs of poor oxygenation, such as clubbing, diminished exercise tolerance, increasing\\ndyspnea on exertion, growth retardation, and eating difficulties. These\\nchildren habitually squat when they feel short of breath; this is thought to decrease venous return of unoxygenated blood from the legs and increase systemic arterial resistance. Children with tetralogy of Fallot also risk developing cerebral abscesses, pulmonary thrombosis, venous thrombosis or cerebral embolism, and infective endocarditis. In females with tetralogy of Fallot who live to childbearing age, incidence of spontaneous abortion, premature births, and low birth weight rises.\", 'Within the first few hours after birth, neonates with transposition of the great arteries and no other heart defects generally\\nshow cyanosis and tachypnea, which worsen with crying. After several days or weeks, such neonates usually develop signs of heart failure (gallop rhythm, tachycardia, dyspnea, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly). S 2 is louder than normal because the anteriorly transposed aorta is directly behind the sternum; in many cases, however, no murmur can be heard during the first few days of life. Associated defects (ASD, VSD, or PDA) cause their typical murmurs and may minimize cyanosis but may also cause other complications (especially severe heart failure). VSD with PS produces a characteristic murmur and severe cyanosis. As infants with this defect grow older, cyanosis is their\\nmost prominent abnormality. However, they also develop diminished exercise tolerance, fatigability, coughing, clubbing, and more pronounced murmurs if ASD, VSD, PDA, or PS is present.', 'Myocarditis usually causes nonspecific symptoms—such as fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, and fever— that reflect the accompanying systemic infection. Occasionally, it may produce mild, continuous pressure or soreness in the chest (unlike the recurring, stress-related pain of angina pectoris). Although myocarditis is usually self-limiting,\\nit may induce myofibril degeneration that results in right- and left-sided heart failure, with cardiomegaly, jugular vein distention, dyspnea, persistent fever with resting or exertional tachycardia disproportionate to the degree of fever, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Sometimes myocarditis recurs or produces chronic valvulitis (when it results from rheumatic fever), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism.', \"Early clinical features of endocarditis are usually nonspecific and include malaise, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, arthralgia, night sweats, chills, valvular insufficiency and, in 90% of patients, an intermittent fever that may recur for weeks. A more acute onset is associated with organisms of high pathogenicity such\\nas S. aureus. Endocarditis commonly causes a\\nloud, regurgitant murmur typical of the underlying heart lesion. A suddenly changing murmur or the discovery of a new murmur in the presence of fever is a classic physical sign of endocarditis. In about 30% of patients, embolization from vegetating lesions or diseased valvular tissue may produce typical features of splenic, renal, cerebral, or pulmonary infarction or of peripheral vascular occlusion: splenic infarction—pain in the left upper quadrant, radiating to the left shoulder; and abdominal rigidity renal infarction—hematuria, pyuria, flank pain, and decreased urine output cerebral infarction—hemiparesis, aphasia, or other neurologic deficits pulmonary infarction (most common in right-sided endocarditis, which commonly occurs among I.V. drug abusers and after cardiac surgery)—cough, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub, dyspnea, and hemoptysis peripheral vascular occlusion—numbness and tingling in an arm, leg, finger, or toe, or signs of impending peripheral gangrene. Other signs may include splenomegaly; petechiae of the skin (especially common on the upper anterior trunk) and the buccal, pharyngeal, or conjunctival mucosa; and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. Rarely, endocarditis produces Osler's nodes (tender, raised, subcutaneous lesions on the fingers or toes), Roth's spots (hemorrhagic areas with white centers on the retina), and Janeway lesions (purplish macules on the palms or soles).\", 'Acute pericarditis typically produces a sharp and often sudden pain that usually starts over the sternum and radiates to the neck, shoulders, back, and arms. However, unlike the pain of MI, pericardial pain is often pleuritic, increasing with deep inspiration and decreasing when the patient sits up and leans forward, pulling the heart away from the diaphragmatic pleurae of the lungs. Pericardial effusion, the major complication of acute pericarditis, may produce effects of heart failure (such as dyspnea, orthopnea, and tachycardia), ill-defined substernal chest pain, and a feeling of fullness in the chest. (See Patterns of cardiac pain .) ALERT If the fluid accumulates rapidly, cardiac tamponade may occur, resulting in pallor, clammy skin, hypotension, pulsus paradoxus (a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg or more during slow inspiration), jugular vein distention and, eventually, cardiovascular collapse and death. Chronic constrictive pericarditis causes a gradual increase in systemic venous pressure and produces symptoms similar to those of chronic right-sided heart failure (fluid retention, ascites, and hepatomegaly).', \"In 95% of patients, rheumatic fever characteristically follows a streptococcal infection that appeared a few days to 6 weeks earlier. A temperature of at least 100.4° F (38° C) occurs, and most patients complain of migratory joint pain or polyarthritis. Swelling, redness, and signs of effusion usually accompany such pain, which most commonly affects the knees, ankles, elbows, or hips. In 5% of patients (generally those with carditis), rheumatic fever causes skin lesions such as erythema marginatum, a nonpruritic, macular, transient rash that\\ngives rise to red lesions with blanched centers. Rheumatic fever may also produce firm, movable, nontender, subcutaneous nodules about 3 mm to 2 cm in diameter, usually near tendons or bony prominences of joints (especially the elbows, knuckles, wrists, and knees) and less often on the scalp and backs of the hands. These nodules persist for a few days to several weeks and, like erythema marginatum, often accompany carditis. Later, rheumatic fever may cause transient chorea, which develops up to 6 months after the original streptococcal infection. Mild\\nchorea may produce hyperirritability, a deterioration in handwriting, or an inability to concentrate. Severe chorea (Sydenham's chorea) causes\\npurposeless, nonrepetitive, involuntary muscle spasms; poor muscle coordination; and weakness. Chorea always resolves without residual neurologic damage. The most destructive effect of rheumatic fever is carditis, which develops in up to 50% of patients and may affect the endocardium, myocardium, pericardium, or the heart valves. Pericarditis causes a pericardial friction rub and, occasionally, pain and effusion. Myocarditis produces characteristic lesions called Aschoff bodies (in the acute stages) and cellular swelling and fragmentation of interstitial collagen, leading to formation of a progressively fibrotic nodule and interstitial scars. Endocarditis causes valve leaflet swelling, erosion along the lines of leaflet closure, and blood, platelet, and fibrin deposits, which form beadlike vegetations. Endocarditis affects the mitral valve most often in females; the aortic,\\nmost often in males. In both females and males, endocarditis affects the tricuspid valves occasionally and the pulmonic only rarely. Severe rheumatic carditis may cause heart failure with dyspnea; right upper quadrant pain; tachycardia; tachypnea; a hacking, nonproductive cough; edema; and significant mitral and aortic murmurs. The most common of such murmurs include: a systolic murmur of mitral insufficiency (high-pitched, blowing, holosystolic, loudest at apex, possibly radiating to the anterior axillary line) a midsystolic murmur due to stiffening and swelling of the mitral leaflet occasionally, a diastolic murmur of aortic\\ninsufficiency (low-pitched, rumbling, almost inaudible). Valvular disease may eventually result in chronic valvular stenosis and insufficiency, including mitral stenosis and insufficiency, and aortic insufficiency. In children, mitral insufficiency remains the major sequela of rheumatic heart disease.\", \"Hypertension usually doesn't produce clinical effects until vascular changes in the heart, brain, or kidneys occur. Severely elevated blood pressure damages the intima of small vessels, resulting in fibrin accumulation in the vessels, development of local edema and, possibly, intravascular clotting. Symptoms produced by this process depend on the location of the damaged vessels: brain — stroke retina — blindness heart — myocardial infarction kidneys — proteinuria, edema and, eventually, renal failure. Hypertension increases the heart's workload, causing left\\nventricular hypertrophy and, later, left- and right-sided heart failure\\nand pulmonary edema.\", \"The classic symptom of CAD is angina, the direct result of inadequate oxygen flow to the myocardium. Anginal pain is usually described as a burning, squeezing, or tight feeling in the substernal or\\nprecordial chest that may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder blade. Typically, the patient clenches his fist over his chest or rubs his left arm when describing the pain, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fainting, sweating, and cool extremities. Anginal episodes most often follow physical exertion but may also follow emotional excitement, exposure to cold, or a large meal. Some patients, particularly those with diabetes, may not experience typical anginal pain but may have dyspnea, fatigue, diaphoreses, or more vague symptoms. Angina has four major forms: stable (pain is predictable in frequency and duration and can be relieved with nitrates and rest), unstable (pain increases in frequency and duration and is more easily induced), Prinzmetal's or variant (from unpredictable coronary artery spasm), and microvascular (in which impairment of vasodilator reserve causes angina-like chest pain in a patient with normal P coronary arteries). Severe and prolonged anginal pain generally suggests MI, with potentially fatal arrhythmias and mechanical failure.\", \"The cardinal symptom of MI is persistent, crushing substernal pain that may radiate to the left arm, jaw, neck, or shoulder\\nblades. Such pain is usually described as heavy, squeezing, or crushing, and may persist for 12 hours or more. However, in some MI patients — particularly elderly people or those with diabetes — pain may\\nnot occur at all; in others, it may be mild and confused with indigestion. In patients with coronary artery disease, angina of increasing frequency, severity, or duration (especially if not provoked by exertion, a heavy meal, or cold and wind) may signal impending infarction.

Thromboembolism ▪ Severe dyspnea and chest pain or neurologic changes. ▪ Nuclear scan shows ventilationperfusion mismatch. ▪ Angiography shows arterial blockage. ▪ Oxygen and heparin Other clinical effects include a feeling of impending doom, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. Some patients may have no symptoms. The patient may experience catecholamine responses, such as coolness in extremities, perspiration, anxiety, and restlessness. Fever is unusual at the onset of an MI, but a low-grade temperature elevation may develop during the next few days. Blood pressure varies; hypotension or hypertension may be present. The most common post-MI complications include recurrent or persistent chest pain, arrhythmias, left- sided heart failure (resulting in heart failure or acute pulmonary edema), and cardiogenic shock. Unusual but potentially lethal complications that may develop soon after infarction include thromboembolism; papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture, causing mitral insufficiency; rupture of the ventricular septum, causing ventricular septal defect; rupture of the myocardium; and ventricular aneurysm. Up to several months after infarction, Dressler's syndrome may develop (pericarditis, pericardial friction rub, chest pain, fever, leukocytosis and, possibly, pleurisy or\\npneumonitis).\", 'Left-sided heart failure primarily produces pulmonary signs and symptoms; right-sided heart failure, primarily systemic signs and symptoms. However, heart failure often affects both sides of the heart. Clinical signs of left-sided heart failure include dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, possibly wheezing, hypoxia, respiratory acidosis, cough, cyanosis or pallor, palpitations, arrhythmias, elevated\\nblood pressure, and pulsus alternans. Clinical signs of right-sided heart failure include dependent peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jugular vein distention, ascites, slow weight gain, arrhythmias, positive hepatojugular reflex, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and syncope. ALERT Excessive fluid can accumulate in the pericardium, requiring removal through pericardiocentesis.', 'In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart ejects blood less efficiently than normal. Consequently, a large volume of blood remains in the left ventricle after systole, causing signs of heart failure—both\\nleft- sided (shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and an irritating dry cough at night) and right-sided (edema, liver engorgement, and jugular vein distention). Dilated cardiomyopathy also produces peripheral cyanosis and sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation at rest in some patients secondary to low cardiac output. Auscultation reveals diffuse apical impulses, pansystolic murmur (mitral and tricuspid insufficiency secondary to cardiomegaly and weak papillary muscles), and S 3 and S 4 gallop rhythms.', \"Clinical features of the disorder may not appear until it's well advanced, when atrial dilation and, possibly, atrial fibrillation abruptly reduce blood flow to the left ventricle. Reduced inflow and subsequent low output may produce angina pectoris, arrhythmias, dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope, heart failure, and death. Auscultation reveals a medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border and at the apex; palpation reveals a peripheral pulse with a characteristic double impulse (pulsus biferiens) and, with atrial fibrillation, an irregular pulse.\", 'Hypovolemic shock produces a syndrome of hypotension, with narrowing pulse pressure; decreased sensorium; tachycardia; rapid, shallow respirations; reduced urine output (less than 25 ml/hour); and cold, pale, clammy skin. Metabolic acidosis with an accumulation of lactic acid develops as a result of tissue anoxia, as cellular metabolism shifts from aerobic to anaerobic pathways. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a possible complication of hypovolemic shock.', \"Cardiogenic shock produces signs of poor tissue perfusion: cold, pale, clammy skin; a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 30 mm Hg below baseline, or a sustained reading below 80 mm Hg not attributable to medication; tachycardia; rapid, shallow respirations; oliguria (less than 20 ml/ hour); restlessness; mental confusion and obtundation; narrowing pulse pressure; and cyanosis. Although many of these clinical features also occur in heart failure and\\nother shock syndromes, they're usually more profound in cardiogenic shock.\", 'Ventricular aneurysm may cause arrhythmias —such as premature ventricular contractions or ventricular tachycardia— palpitations, signs of cardiac dysfunction (weakness on exertion, fatigue, and angina) and, occasionally, a visible or palpable systolic precordial bulge. This condition may also lead to left ventricular dysfunction, with chronic heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, edema, crackles, gallop rhythm, and jugular vein distention); pulmonary edema; systemic embolization; and, with left- sided heart failure, pulsus alternans. Ventricular aneurysms enlarge but seldom rupture.', 'Cardiac tamponade classically produces increased venous pressure with jugular vein distention, reduced arterial blood pressure, muffled heart sounds on auscultation, and pulsus paradoxus (an abnormal inspiratory drop in systemic blood pressure greater than 15 mm Hg). The absence of a preexisting pericardial friction rub may suggest an increase in fluid in the pericardial space. These classic symptoms represent failure of physiologic compensatory mechanisms to override the\\neffects of rapidly rising pericardial pressure, which limits diastolic filling of the ventricles and reduces stroke volume to a critically low level. Generally, ventricular end-systolic volume may drop because of inadequate preload. The increasing pericardial pressure is transmitted equally across the heart cavities, producing a matching rise in intracardiac pressure, especially\\natrial and end-diastolic ventricular pressures. Cardiac tamponade may also cause dyspnea, diaphoresis, pallor or cyanosis, anxiety, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, restlessness, and hepatomegaly, but the lung fields will be clear. The patient typically sits upright and leans forward.', 'Signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias include palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, changes in pulse patterns, paleness, and the temporary absence of breathing. However, the patient with a cardiac arrhythmia may be asymptomatic until the development of sudden cardiac arrest.', \"The most common symptom of thoracic aortic aneurysm is pain. With ascending aneurysm, the pain is described as severe, boring, and ripping and extends to the neck, shoulders, lower back, or abdomen but seldom radiates to the jaw and arms. Pain is more severe on the right side. Other signs of ascending aneurysm may include bradycardia, aortic insufficiency, pericardial friction rub caused by a hemopericardium, unequal intensities of the right carotid and left radial pulses, and a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms. These signs are absent in descending aneurysm. If dissection involves the carotids, an abrupt onset of neurologic deficits may occur. With descending aneurysm, pain usually starts suddenly between the shoulder blades and may radiate to the chest; it's described\\nas sharp and tearing. Transverse aneurysm causes a sudden, sharp, tearing pain radiating to the shoulders. It may also cause hoarseness, dyspnea, dysphagia, and a dry cough because of compression of surrounding structures in this area. (See Clinical characteristics of thoracic dissection, page 83.)\", \"Although abdominal aneurysms usually don't produce symptoms, most are evident (unless the patient is obese) as a pulsating mass in the periumbilical area, accompanied by a systolic bruit over the aorta. Some tenderness may be present on deep palpation. A large aneurysm may produce symptoms that mimic renal calculi, lumbar disk disease, and duodenal compression. Abdominal aneurysms rarely cause diminished peripheral pulses or claudication, unless embolization occurs. Lumbar pain that radiates to the flank and groin from pressure on lumbar nerves may signify enlargement and imminent rupture. A\\nrare but recognized symptom is unrelenting testicular pain with no other cause. If the aneurysm ruptures into the peritoneal cavity, it causes severe, persistent abdominal and back pain, mimicking renal or ureteral colic. Signs of hemorrhage—such as weakness, sweating, tachycardia, and hypotension—may be subtle because rupture into the retroperitoneal space produces a tamponade effect that prevents continued hemorrhage. Patients with such rupture may remain stable for hours before shock and death occur, although 20% die immediately.\", \"Popliteal aneurysms may cause pain in the popliteal space\\nwhen they're large enough to compress the medial popliteal nerve and edema and venous distention if the vein is compressed. Femoral and popliteal aneurysms can produce symptoms of severe ischemia in the leg or foot due to acute thrombosis within the aneurysmal sac, embolization of mural thrombus fragments and, rarely, rupture. Symptoms of acute aneurysmal thrombosis include severe pain, loss of pulse and color, coldness in the affected leg or foot, and gangrene. Distal petechial hemorrhages may develop from aneurysmal emboli. ENDOVASCULAR GRAFTING FOR REPAIR OF AN AAA Endovascular grafting is a minimally invasive procedure for the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This procedure reinforces the walls of the aorta to prevent rupture and prevent expansion of the aneurysm. Endovascular grafting is performed with fluoroscopic guidance: Using a guide wire, a delivery catheter with an attached compressed graft is inserted through a small incision into the femoral or iliac artery. The delivery catheter is advanced into the aorta, where\\nit's positioned across the aneurysm. A balloon on the catheter expands the graft and affixes it to the vessel wall. The procedure generally takes 2 to 3 hours to perform. Patients are instructed to walk the first day after surgery and are generally discharged from the facility in 1 to 3 days.\", 'In both types of thrombophlebitis, clinical features vary\\nwith the site and length of the affected vein. Although DVT may occur asymptomatically, it may also produce severe pain, fever, chills, malaise and, possibly, swelling and cyanosis of the affected arm or leg.\\nSuperficial thrombophlebitis produces visible and palpable signs, such as heat, pain, swelling, rubor, tenderness, and induration along the length of the affected vein. Varicose veins may also be present. (See Varicose veins .) Extensive vein involvement may cause lymphadenitis.', \"After exposure to cold or stress, the skin on the fingers\\ntypically blanches and then becomes cyanotic before changing to red and\\nbefore changing from cold to normal temperature. Numbness and tingling may also occur. These symptoms are relieved by warmth. In long-standing disease, trophic changes, such as sclerodactyly, ulcerations, or chronic\\nparonychia, may result. Although it's extremely uncommon, minimal cutaneous gangrene necessitates amputation of one or more phalanges.\", \"Buerger's disease typically produces intermittent claudication of the instep, which is aggravated by exercise and relieved\\nby rest. During exposure to low temperature, the feet initially become cold, cyanotic, and numb; later, they redden, become hot, and tingle. Occasionally, Buerger's disease also affects the hands, possibly resulting in painful fingertip ulcerations. Associated signs and symptoms may include impaired peripheral pulses, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis and, in later stages, ulceration, muscle atrophy, and gangrene.\", 'P The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease depend on the site of the occlusion. (See Types of peripheral artery disease, page 96.)'], 'Diagnosis': [\"P Diagnostic findings include: Chest X-ray is normal in small defects; in\\nlarge VSDs, it shows cardiomegaly, left atrial and left ventricular enlargement, and prominent pulmonary vascular markings. Electrocardiography (ECG) is normal in children with small VSDs; in large VSDs, it shows left and right ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography may detect a large VSD and its location in the septum, estimate the size of a left- to-right shunt, suggest pulmonary hypertension, and identify associated lesions and complications. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization determines the VSD's size and exact location, calculates the degree of shunting by comparing the blood oxygen saturation in each ventricle, determines the extent of pulmonary hypertension, and detects associated defects.\", 'A history of increasing fatigue and characteristic physical features suggest ASD. The following findings confirm it: Chest X-ray shows an enlarged right atrium\\nand right ventricle, a prominent pulmonary artery, and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Electrocardiography may be normal but usually shows right axis deviation, prolonged PR interval, varying degrees of right bundle-branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation (particularly in severe cases after age 30) and, in ostium primum defect, left axis deviation. Echocardiography measures right ventricular enlargement, may locate the defect, and shows volume overload in the right side of the heart. (Other causes of right ventricular enlargement must be ruled out.) P CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Two-dimensional echocardiography with color Doppler flow, contrast echocardiography, or both have supplanted cardiac catheterization as the confirming tests for ASD. Cardiac catheterization is used if inconsistencies exist in the clinical\\ndata or if significant pulmonary hypertension is suspected.', 'CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The cardinal signs of coarctation of\\nthe aorta are resting systolic hypertension, absent or diminished femoral pulses, and wide pulse pressure. The following tests support this diagnosis: Chest X-ray may demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, a wide ascending and descending aorta, and notching of the undersurfaces of the ribs, due to extensive collateral circulation. (See Recognizing coarctation of the aorta , page 14.) Electrocardiography may eventually reveal left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography may show increased left ventricular muscle thickness, coexisting aortic valve abnormalities, and\\nthe coarctation site. Doppler ultrasound and cardiac catheterization evaluate collateral circulation and measure pressure in the right and left ventricles and in the ascending and descending aortas\\n(on both sides of the obstruction). Aortography locates the site and extent of coarctation. P', 'Chest X-ray may show increased pulmonary vascular markings, prominent pulmonary arteries, and left ventricle and aorta enlargement. Electrocardiography (ECG) may be normal or\\nmay indicate left atrial or ventricular hypertrophy and, in pulmonary vascular disease, biventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography detects and helps estimate the size of a PDA. It also reveals an enlarged left atrium and left ventricle or right ventricular hypertrophy from pulmonary vascular disease. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization shows pulmonary arterial oxygen content higher than right ventricular content because of the influx of aortic blood. Increased pulmonary artery pressure indicates a large shunt or, if it exceeds systemic arterial pressure, severe pulmonary vascular disease. Catheterization allows calculation of blood volume crossing the ductus and can rule out associated cardiac defects. Dye injection definitively demonstrates PDA.', \"In a patient with tetralogy of Fallot, auscultation detects a loud systolic heart murmur (best heard along the left sternal border), which may diminish or obscure the pulmonic component of S 2 .\\nIn a patient with a large patent ductus, the continuous murmur of the ductus obscures the systolic murmur. Palpation may reveal a cardiac thrill at the left sternal border and an obvious right ventricular impulse. The inferior sternum appears prominent. The results of special tests also support the diagnosis: Chest X-ray may demonstrate decreased pulmonary vascular marking, depending on the pulmonary obstruction's severity, and a boot-shaped cardiac silhouette. Electrocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation and, possibly, right atrial hypertrophy. Echocardiography identifies septal overriding of the aorta, the VSD, and pulmonary stenosis and detects the\\nhypertrophied walls of the right ventricle. Laboratory findings reveal diminished arterial oxygen saturation and polycythemia (hematocrit may be more than\\n60%) if the cyanosis is severe and long-standing, predisposing the patient to thrombosis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization confirms the\\ndiagnosis by visualizing pulmonary stenosis, the VSD, and the overriding aorta and ruling out other cyanotic heart defects. This test also measures the degree of oxygen saturation in aortic blood.\", 'Chest X-rays are normal in the first days of life. Within days to weeks, right atrial and right ventricular enlargement characteristically cause the heart to appear oblong. X-rays also show increased pulmonary vascular markings, except when pulmonary stenosis coexists. Electrocardiography typically reveals right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy but may be normal in a neonate. Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements indicate hypoxia and secondary metabolic acidosis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Echocardiography demonstrates the reversed position of the aorta and pulmonary artery and records echoes from both semilunar valves simultaneously, due to aortic valve displacement. It also detects other cardiac defects. Cardiac catheterization reveals decreased oxygen saturation in left ventricular blood and aortic blood; increased right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery oxygen saturation; and right ventricular systolic pressure equal to systemic pressure. Dye injection reveals the transposed vessels and the presence of any other cardiac defects. P', \"Patient history commonly reveals recent febrile upper respiratory tract infection, viral pharyngitis, or tonsillitis. Physical\\nexamination shows supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, S 3 and S 4 gallops, a faint S 1 ,\\npossibly a murmur of mitral insufficiency (from papillary muscle dysfunction) and, if pericarditis is present, a pericardial friction rub. Laboratory tests can't unequivocally confirm myocarditis, but the following findings support this diagnosis: P cardiac enzymes: elevated creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels increased white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevated antibody titers (such as antistreptolysin-O titer in rheumatic fever). CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely performed to diagnose myocarditis; the procedure is invasive and costly. A negative biopsy doesn't exclude the diagnosis, and a repeat biopsy may be needed. ECG typically shows diffuse ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities as in pericarditis, conduction defects (prolonged PR interval), and other supraventricular arrhythmias. Echocardiography demonstrates some degree of left ventricular dysfunction, and radionuclide scanning may identify inflammatory and necrotic changes characteristic of myocarditis. Stool and throat cultures may identify bacteria.\", 'CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS P Three or more blood cultures in a 24- to 48-hour period (each from a separate venipuncture) identify the causative organism in up to 90% of patients. Blood cultures should be drawn from three different sites with 1 hour between each draw. The remaining 10% may have negative blood cultures, possibly suggesting fungal infection or infections that are difficult to\\ndiagnose such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Other abnormal but nonspecific laboratory test results include: normal or elevated white blood cell count abnormal histiocytes (macrophages) elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate normocytic, normochromic anemia (in 70% to 90% of patients) proteinuria and microscopic hematuria (in about 50% of patients) positive serum rheumatoid factor (in about 50% of patients after endocarditis is present for 3 to 6 weeks). Echocardiography (particularly, transesophageal) may identify valvular damage; electrocardiography may show atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias that accompany valvular disease.', \"Because pericarditis commonly coexists with other conditions, diagnosis of acute pericarditis depends on typical clinical features and elimination of other possible causes. The pericardial friction rub, a classic symptom, is a grating sound heard as the heart moves. It can usually be auscultated best during forced expiration, while the patient leans forward or is on his hands and knees in bed. It may have up to three components, corresponding to the timing of atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the rapid-filling phase of ventricular\\ndiastole. Occasionally, this friction rub is heard only briefly or not at all. Nevertheless, its presence, together with other characteristic features, is diagnostic of acute pericarditis. In addition, if acute pericarditis has caused very large pericardial effusions, physical examination reveals increased cardiac dullness and diminished or absent apical impulse and distant heart sounds. Chest X-ray, echocardiogram, chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), heart MRI, heart computed tomography scan, and radionuclide scanning can detect fluid that has accumulated in the pericardial P sac. They may also show enlargement of the heart and signs of inflammation or scarring, depending on the cause of pericarditis. In patients with chronic pericarditis, acute inflammation or effusions don't occur—only restricted cardiac filling. Laboratory results reflect inflammation and may identify its cause: normal or elevated white blood cell count, especially in infectious pericarditis elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate slightly elevated cardiac enzyme levels with associated myocarditis culture of pericardial fluid obtained by open surgical drainage or cardiocentesis (sometimes identifies a causative organism in bacterial or fungal pericarditis) electrocardiography showing the following changes in acute pericarditis: elevation of ST segments in the standard limb leads and most precordial leads without significant changes in QRS morphology that occur with MI, atrial ectopic rhythms such as atrial fibrillation and, in pericardial effusion, diminished QRS voltage. Other pertinent laboratory data include blood urea nitrogen levels to check for uremia, antistreptolysin-O titers to detect\\nrheumatic fever, and a purified protein derivative skin test to check for tuberculosis. In pericardial effusion, echocardiography is diagnostic when it shows an echo-free space between the ventricular wall\\nand the pericardium.\", \"Diagnosis depends on recognition of one or more of the classic symptoms (carditis, rheumatic fever without carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, or subcutaneous nodules) and\\na detailed patient history. Laboratory data support the diagnosis: White blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated (during the acute phase); blood studies show slight anemia due to suppressed erythropoiesis during inflammation. C-reactive protein is positive (especially during acute phase). Cardiac enzyme levels may be increased in severe carditis. Antistreptolysin-O titer is elevated in 95% of patients within 2 months of onset. Electrocardiogram changes aren't diagnostic; but PR interval is prolonged in 20% of patients. Chest X-rays show normal heart size (except with myocarditis, heart failure, or pericardial effusion). Echocardiography helps evaluate valvular damage, chamber size, and ventricular function. Cardiac catheterization evaluates valvular damage and left ventricular function in severe cardiac dysfunction.\", \"Serial blood pressure measurements are obtained and compared to previous readings and trends to reveal an increase in diastolic and systolic pressures. (See Classifying blood pressure readings. ) Auscultation may reveal bruits over the abdominal aorta and the carotid, renal, and femoral arteries; ophthalmoscopy reveals arteriovenous nicking and, in hypertensive encephalopathy, papilledema. Patient history and the following additional tests may show predisposing\\nfactors and help identify an underlying cause such as renal disease: Urinalysis: Protein levels and red and white blood cell counts may indicate glomerulonephritis. Excretory urography: Renal atrophy indicates chronic renal disease; one kidney more than 5/8″ (1.5 cm) shorter than the other suggests unilateral renal disease. Serum potassium: Levels less than 3.5 mEq/L may indicate adrenal dysfunction (primary hyperaldosteronism). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine: BUN level that's normal or elevated to more than 20 mg/dl and serum creatinine level that's normal or elevated to more than 1.5 mg/dl suggest renal disease. CLASSIFYING BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS The National Institutes of Health, which used to classify\\nblood pressure according to severity categories — mild, moderate, severe, and very severe — has replaced this classification system with a\\nsystem based on stages. The following revised categories are based on the average\\nof two or more readings taken on separate visits after an initial screening. They apply to adults age 18 and older who aren't taking antihypertensives, aren't acutely ill, and don't have other health conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease. (If the P systolic and diastolic pressures fall into different categories, use the higher of the two pressures to classify the reading. For example, a reading of 160/92 mm Hg should be classified as stage 2.) Normal blood pressure with respect to cardiovascular risk\\nis a systolic reading below 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading below 80 mm Hg. In general, hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg. (For patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, hypertension is defined as a reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher.) Category Systolic Diastolic Normal < 120 mm Hg and < 80 mm Hg Pre-hypertension 120 to 139 mm Hg or 80 to 89 mm Hg Hypertension Stage 1 140 to 159 mm Hg or 90 to 99 mm Hg Stage 2 160 mm Hg or 100 mm Hg In addition to classifying stages of hypertension based on average blood pressure readings, clinicians should also take note of target organ disease and any additional risk factors. For example, a patient with diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a blood pressure reading of 144/98 mm Hg would be classified as “stage I hypertension with target-organ disease (left ventricular hypertrophy) and another major risk factor (diabetes).” This additional information is important to obtain a true picture of the patient's cardiovascular health. Other tests help detect cardiovascular damage and other complications: Electrocardiography may show left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. Chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly. Echocardiography may show left ventricular hypertrophy.\", \"The patient history — including the frequency and duration of angina and the presence of associated risk factors — is crucial in evaluating CAD. Additional diagnostic measures include the following: Electrocardiogram (ECG) during angina may show ischemia and, possibly, arrhythmias such as premature ventricular contractions. ECG is apt to be normal when the patient is pain-free. Arrhythmias may occur without infarction, secondary to ischemia. Treadmill or exercise stress test may provoke chest pain and ECG signs of myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography reveals coronary artery stenosis or obstruction, possible collateral circulation, and the\\narteries' condition beyond the narrowing. Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201, Cardiolite, or Myoview during treadmill exercise detects ischemic areas of the myocardium, visualized as “cold spots.” Stress echocardiography may show wall motion abnormalities. Electron-beam computed tomography identifies calcium within arterial plaque; the more calcium seen, the higher the likelihood of CAD. CORONARY ARTERY SPASM In coronary artery spasm, a spontaneous, sustained contraction of one or more coronary arteries causes ischemia and dysfunction of the heart muscle. This disorder also causes Prinzmetal's angina and even myocardial infarction in patients with unoccluded coronary arteries. Its cause is unknown but possible contributing factors include: altered flow of calcium into the cell intimal hemorrhage into the medial layer of the blood vessel hyperventilation elevated catecholamine levels fatty buildup in lumen Signs and symptoms The major symptom of coronary artery spasm is angina. But\\nunlike classic angina, this pain often occurs spontaneously and may not\\nbe related to physical exertion or emotional stress; it's also more severe, usually lasts longer, and may be cyclic, frequently recurring every day at the same time. Such ischemic episodes may cause arrhythmias, altered heart rate, lower blood pressure and, occasionally,\\nfainting due to diminished cardiac output. Spasm in the left coronary artery may result in mitral insufficiency, producing a loud systolic murmur and, possibly, pulmonary edema, with dyspnea, crackles, hemoptysis, or sudden death. Treatment After diagnosis by coronary angiography and electrocardiography (ECG), the patient may receive calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, or P diltiazem) to reduce coronary artery\\nspasm and vascular resistance; and nitrates (nitroglycerin or isosorbide dinitrate) to relieve chest pain. When caring for a patient with coronary artery spasm, explain all necessary procedures and teach him how to take his medications safely. For calcium antagonist therapy, monitor blood pressure, pulse rate, and ECG patterns to detect arrhythmias. For nifedipine and verapamil therapy, monitor digoxin levels and check for signs of digoxin toxicity. Because nifedipine may cause peripheral and periorbital edema, watch for fluid retention. Because coronary artery spasm is commonly associated with\\natherosclerotic disease, advise the patient to stop smoking, avoid overeating, maintain a low-fat diet, use alcohol sparingly, and maintain\\na balance between exercise and rest.\", 'CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Persistent chest pain, elevated ST segment on electrocardiogram (ECG), and elevated total creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels over a 72-hour period usually confirm MI. Troponin\\nT or troponin I is also used in the diagnosis because both are specific\\nto cardiac necrosis, and levels rise 6 to 8 hours after onset of ischemia. Auscultation may reveal diminished heart sounds, gallops and, in papillary dysfunction, the apical systolic murmur of mitral insufficiency over the mitral valve area. When clinical features are equivocal, assume that the patient had an MI until tests rule it out. Diagnostic laboratory results\\ninclude: serial 12-lead ECG — ECG abnormalities may\\nbe absent or inconclusive during the first few hours after an MI. When present, characteristic abnormalities include serial ST-segment depression in non-Q-wave (subendocardial) MI and ST-segment elevation in\\nQ-wave (transmural) MI. serial serum enzyme levels — CK levels are elevated, specifically, the CK-MB isoenzyme. echocardiography — may show ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients with a Q-wave (transmural) MI. nuclear ventriculography scans (multiple gated acquisition or radionuclide ventriculography)— using I.V. radioactive substance, can identify acutely damaged muscle by picking up\\nradioactive nucleotide, which appears as a “hot spot” on the film; useful in localizing a recent MI.', 'Electrocardiography may reflect heart strain or enlargement, ischemia, or old MI. It may also reveal atrial enlargement, tachycardia, and extrasystoles. Chest X-ray shows increased pulmonary vascular markings, interstitial edema, or pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring typically demonstrates elevated pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in left-sided heart failure, and elevated right atrial pressure or central venous pressure in right-sided heart failure. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neuro-hormone produced predominantly by the heart ventricle and is released in response to blood volume expansion or pressure overload. Blood concentrations P greater than 100 pg/ml are an accurate predictor of\\nheart failure. (See Linking BNP levels to heart failure symptom severity. ) Echocardiogram may demonstrate wall motion abnormalities and chamber dilation. Other tests that may also demonstrate enlargement of the heart or decreased functioning include chest computed tomography scan, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nuclear scans, such as multiple-gated acquisition scanning and radionuclide ventriculography.', 'No single test confirms dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis\\nrequires elimination of other possible causes of heart failure and arrhythmias. Electrocardiography (ECG) and angiography rule out ischemic heart disease; ECG may also show biventricular hypertrophy, sinus tachycardia, atrial enlargement and, in 20% of patients, atrial fibrillation and bundle-branch block. Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly—usually affecting all heart chambers—and may demonstrate pulmonary congestion, pleural or pericardial effusion, or pulmonary venous hypertension. Chest computed tomography scan or echocardiography identifies left ventricular thrombi, global hypokinesia, and degree of left ventricular dilation. Nuclear heart scans, such as multiple-gated acquisition scanning and ventriculography, show heart enlargement, lung congestion, heart failure, and decreased movement or functioning of the heart.', 'Diagnosis depends on typical clinical findings and these test results: Echocardiography (most useful) shows increased thickness of the intra-ventricular septum and abnormal motion of the anterior mitral leaflet during systole, occluding left ventricular outflow in obstructive disease. Cardiac catheterization reveals elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and, possibly, mitral insufficiency. Electrocardiography usually shows left ventricular hypertrophy, T-wave inversion, left anterior hemiblock, Q waves in precordial and inferior leads, ventricular arrhythmias and, possibly, atrial fibrillation. Auscultation confirms an early systolic murmur.', 'P No single symptom or diagnostic test establishes the diagnosis or severity of shock. Characteristic laboratory findings include: elevated potassium, serum lactate, and blood urea nitrogen levels increased urine specific gravity (more than 1.020) and urine osmolality decreased blood pH and partial pressure of arterial oxygen and increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide. In addition, gastroscopy, aspiration of gastric contents through a nasogastric tube, computed tomography scan, and X-rays identify internal bleeding sites; coagulation studies may detect coagulopathy from DIC. Echocardiography or rightheart catheterization can help differentiate between hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.', \"Auscultation may detect gallop rhythm, faint heart sounds\\nand, possibly, if the shock results from rupture of the ventricular septum or papillary muscles, a holosystolic murmur. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring\\nmay show increased PAP, and increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), reflecting a rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload) and increased resistance to left ventricular emptying (afterload) due to ineffective pumping and P increased peripheral vascular\\nresistance. Thermodilution technique measures decreased cardiac output. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring may indicate hypotension due to impaired ventricular ejection. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis may show metabolic acidosis and hypoxia. Electrocardiography may show possible evidence of acute MI, ischemia, or ventricular aneurysm. Echocardiography can determine left ventricular function and reveal valvular abnormalities. Enzyme levels may show elevated creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, which point to MI or ischemia and suggest heart failure or shock. Troponin I, troponin T, and isoenzyme values may confirm acute MI. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK When the myocardium can't contract sufficiently to maintain adequate cardiac output, stroke volume decreases and the heart can't eject an adequate volume of blood with each contraction. The blood\\nbacks up behind the weakened left ventricle, increasing preload and causing pulmonary congestion. In addition, to compensate for the drop in\\nstroke volume, the heart rate increases in an attempt to maintain cardiac output. As a result of the diminished stroke volume, coronary artery perfusion and collateral blood flow decrease. All of these mechanisms increase the heart's workload and enhance left-sided heart failure. The result is myocardial hypoxia, further decreased cardiac output, and a triggering of compensatory mechanisms to prevent decompensation and death. P Additional tests determine other conditions that can lead\\nto pump dysfunction and failure, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, papillary muscle infarct or rupture, ventricular septal rupture, pulmonary emboli, venous pooling (associated with vasodilators and continuous intermittent positive-pressure breathing), and hypovolemia.\", \"Persistent ventricular arrhythmias, onset of heart failure, or systemic embolization in a patient with left-sided heart failure and a history of MI strongly suggests ventricular aneurysm. Indicative tests include the following: Left ventriculography reveals left ventricular enlargement, with an area of akinesia or dyskinesia (during cineangiography) and diminished cardiac function. Electrocardiography may show persistent ST-T wave elevations after infarction. Chest X-ray may demonstrate an abnormal bulge distorting the heart's contour if the aneurysm is large; the X-ray\\nmay be normal if the aneurysm is small. Noninvasive nuclear cardiology scan may indicate the site of infarction and suggest the area of aneurysm. Echocardiography shows abnormal motion in the left ventricular wall. P\", 'Chest X-ray shows slightly widened mediastinum and cardiomegaly. P Electrocardiography (ECG) is rarely diagnostic of tamponade but is useful in ruling out other cardiac disorders. It may reveal changes produced by acute pericarditis. Pulmonary artery catheterization detects increased right atrial pressure, right ventricular diastolic pressure, and central venous pressure (CVP). Echocardiography, computed tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging shows pericardial effusion with signs of right ventricular and atrial compression.', 'Diagnosis is made by tests that reveal the arrhythmia, such as 12-lead electrocardiography. Ambulatory cardiac monitoring (Holter monitoring), echocardiography, electrophysiology studies, and coronary angiography may also confirm or rule out suspected causes of arrhythmias and help determine treatment.', 'Diagnosis relies on patient history, clinical features, and appropriate tests. In an asymptomatic patient, diagnosis often occurs accidentally when chest X-rays show widening of the aorta. Other tests help confirm aneurysm: Aortography, the most definitive test, shows the lumen of the aneurysm, its size and location, and the false lumen in dissecting aneurysm. Electrocardiography (ECG) helps distinguish thoracic aneurysm from myocardial infarction. Echocardiography may help identify dissecting aneurysm of the aortic root. Hemoglobin levels may be normal or low, due to blood loss from a leaking aneurysm. Computed tomography scan can confirm and locate the aneurysm and may be used to monitor its progression. Magnetic resonance imaging may aid diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography is used to diagnose and size an aneurysm in either the ascending or the descending aorta.', \"Because abdominal aneurysms seldom produce symptoms, they're commonly detected accidentally as the result of an X-ray or a routine physical examination. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Several tests can confirm a suspected abdominal aneurysm. Serial ultrasound (sonography) can accurately determine the aneurysm's size, shape, and location. Anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of the abdomen can detect aortic calcification, which outlines the mass, at least 75% of the time. Aortography shows the condition of vessels proximal and distal to the aneurysm and the aneurysm's extent but may underestimate aneurysm diameter because it visualizes only the flow channel and not the surrounding clot. Computed tomography scan is used to diagnose and size the aneurysm. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used as an alternative to aortography. P\", 'Diagnosis is usually confirmed by bilateral palpation that reveals a pulsating mass above or below the inguinal ligament in femoral aneurysm. When thrombosis has occurred, palpation detects a firm, nonpulsating mass. Arteriography or ultrasound may be indicated in\\ndoubtful situations. Arteriography may also detect associated aneurysms, especially those in the abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries. Ultrasound may be helpful in determining the size of the popliteal or femoral artery.', \"Some patients may display signs of inflammation and, possibly, a positive Homans' sign (pain on dorsiflexion of the foot) during physical examination; others are asymptomatic. Physical findings are usually non-specific and not reliable for making the diagnosis of DVT. Essential laboratory tests include: Duplex Doppler ultrasonography and impedance plethysmography make it possible to noninvasively examine the major veins (but not calf veins). Plethysmography shows decreased circulation distal to the affected area; this test is more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting DVT. VARICOSE VEINS Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous veins, usually affecting the subcutaneous leg veins—the saphenous veins and their branches. They can result from congenital weakness of the valves or venous wall, diseases of the venous system such as deep vein thrombophlebitis, conditions that produce prolonged venostasis such as pregnancy, or occupations that necessitate standing for an extended period. Varicose veins may be asymptomatic or produce mild to severe leg symptoms, including a feeling of heaviness; cramps at night; diffuse, dull aching after prolonged standing or walking; aching during menses; fatigability; palpable nodules and, with deep-vein incompetency,\\northostatic edema and stasis pigmentation of the calves and ankles. P Treatment In mild to moderate varicose veins, antiembolism stockings or elastic bandages counteract pedal and ankle swelling by supporting the veins and improving circulation. An exercise program such\\nas walking promotes muscular contraction and forces blood through the veins, thereby minimizing venous pooling. Severe varicose veins may necessitate stripping and ligation or, as an alternative to surgery, injection of a sclerosing agent into small affected vein segments. To promote comfort and minimize worsening of varicosities: Discourage the patient from wearing constrictive clothing. Advise the patient to elevate his legs above heart level whenever possible and to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. After stripping and ligation or after injection of a sclerosing agent: To relieve pain, administer analgesics as ordered. Frequently check circulation in toes (color and temperature) and observe elastic bandages for bleeding. When ordered, rewrap bandages at least once a shift, wrapping from toe to thigh, with the leg elevated. Watch for signs of complications, such as sensory loss in the leg (which could indicate saphenous nerve damage), calf pain (thrombophlebitis), and fever (infection). CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Phlebography, which shows filling defects and diverted blood flow, usually confirms the diagnosis. Diagnosis must also rule out peripheral artery disease, lymphangitis, cellulitis, and myositis. Diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis is based on physical examination (redness and warmth over the affected area, palpable vein, and pain during palpation or compression).\", \"Clinical criteria that establish Raynaud's disease include skin color changes induced by cold or stress; bilateral involvement; absence of gangrene or, if present, minimal cutaneous gangrene; normal arterial pulses; and patient history of clinical symptoms of longer than 2 years' duration. Diagnosis must also rule out secondary disease processes, such as chronic arterial occlusive or connective tissue disease.\", \"Patient history and physical examination strongly suggest Buerger's disease. Supportive diagnostic tests include: Doppler ultrasonography to show diminished circulation in the peripheral vessels plethysmography to help detect decreased circulation in the peripheral vessels angiography or arteriography to locate lesions and rule out atherosclerosis.\", \"Diagnosis of peripheral artery disease is usually indicated by patient history and physical examination. Pertinent supportive diagnostic tests include the following: Arteriography demonstrates the type (thrombus or embolus), location, and degree of obstruction and the collateral circulation. It's particularly useful in chronic disease or for evaluating candidates for reconstructive surgery. Doppler ultrasonography and plethysmography are noninvasive tests that show decreased blood flow distal to the occlusion in acute disease. Ophthalmodynamometry helps determine the degree of obstruction in the internal carotid artery by comparing ophthalmic artery pressure to brachial artery pressure on the affected side. More than a 20% difference between pressures suggests insufficiency. EEG and computed tomography scan may be necessary to rule out brain lesions.\"], 'Treatment': [\"In mild cases, no treatment is needed, although the infant should be closely followed to make sure that the hole closes properly as he grows. Large defects usually require early surgical correction before heart failure and irreversible pulmonary vascular disease develop. For small defects, surgery consists of simple suture closure. Moderate to large defects require insertion of a patch graft, using cardiopulmonary bypass. In patients with heart failure, digoxin and diuretics may be prescribed to control symptoms. In patients who develop increased pulmonary resistance and irreversible pulmonary vascular changes that produce a reversible right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger's syndrome), a heart-lung transplant may be required. If the child has other defects and will benefit from delaying surgery, pulmonary artery banding normalizes pressures and flow\\ndistal to the band and prevents pulmonary vascular disease, allowing postponement of surgery. (Pulmonary artery banding is done only when the\\nchild has other complications.) A rare complication of VSD repair is complete heart block from interference with the bundle of His during surgery. (Heart block may require temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation.) Before surgery, treatment consists of: digoxin, sodium restriction, and diuretics to prevent heart failure careful monitoring by physical examination, X-ray, and ECG to detect increased pulmonary hypertension, which indicates a need for early surgery measures to prevent infection (prophylactic antibiotics, for example, to prevent infective endocarditis). Generally, postoperative treatment includes a brief period of mechanical ventilation. The patient will need analgesics and may also require diuretics to increase urine output, continuous infusions of nitroprusside or adrenergic agents to regulate blood pressure and cardiac output and, in rare cases, a temporary pacemaker.\", \"Operative repair is advised for all patients with uncomplicated ASD with evidence of significant left- to-right shunting. Ideally, this is performed when the patient is between ages 2 and 4. Operative treatment shouldn't be performed on patients with small defects and trivial left-to-right shunts. Because ASD seldom produces complications in infants and toddlers, surgery can be delayed until they reach preschool or early school age. A large defect may need immediate surgical closure with sutures or a patch graft. Physicians have developed a new procedure, referred to as\\ncatheter closure or transcatheter closure of the atrial septal defect, that uses wires or catheters that can close ASD without surgery. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a tiny incision in the groin to introduce the catheters. Then, he advances the catheters into the heart and places\\nthe closure device across the ASD. This procedure may not be applicable\\nto all patients.\", \"For an infant with heart failure caused by coarctation of\\nthe aorta, treatment consists of medical management with digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, and sedatives. If medical management fails, surgery may be needed. The child's condition usually determines the timing of surgery. Signs of heart failure or hypertension may call for early surgery. If these signs don't appear, surgery usually occurs during the preschool years. Before the operation, the child may require endocarditis prophylaxis or, if he's older and has previously undetected coarctation,\\nantihypertensive therapy. During surgery, the surgeon uses a flap of the left subclavian artery to reconstruct an unobstructed aorta. RECOGNIZING COARCTATION OF THE AORTA Collateral circulation develops to bypass the occluded aortic lumen, and can be seen on X-ray as notching of the ribs. By adolescence, palpable, visible pulsations may be evident. Balloon therapy may be indicated for some patients as an alternative to surgical repair. It uses a technique similar to that used\\nto open the coronary arteries, but is performed on the aorta.\", \"Asymptomatic infants with PDA require no immediate treatment. Those with heart failure require fluid restriction, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides to minimize or control symptoms. If these measures can't control heart failure, surgery is necessary to ligate the ductus. If symptoms are mild, surgical correction is usually delayed until the infant is between ages 6 months to 3 years, unless problems develop. Before surgery, children with PDA require antibiotics to protect against infective endocarditis. P Other forms of therapy include cardiac catheterization to\\ndeposit a plug or coil in the ductus to stop shunting or administration\\nof indomethacin I.V. (a prostaglandin inhibitor that's an alternative to surgery in premature neonates) to induce ductus spasm and closure.\", \"Effective management of tetralogy of Fallot necessitates prevention and treatment of complications, measures to relieve cyanosis,\\nand palliative or corrective surgery. During cyanotic spells, the knee- chest position and administration of oxygen and morphine improve oxygenation. Propranolol (a beta- adrenergic blocking agent) may prevent blue spells. Palliative surgery is performed on infants with potentially fatal hypoxic spells. The goal of surgery is to enhance blood flow to the lungs to reduce hypoxia; this is often accomplished by\\njoining the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery (Blalock-Taussig procedure). Supportive measures include prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis or cerebral abscess administered before, during, and after bowel, bladder, or any other surgery or dental treatments. Management may also include phlebotomy in children with polycythemia. Complete corrective surgery to relieve pulmonary stenosis\\nand close the VSD, directing left ventricular outflow to the aorta, requires cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermia to decrease oxygen utilization during surgery, especially in young children. An infant may have this corrective surgery without prior palliative surgery. It's usually done when progressive hypoxia and polycythemia impair the quality of his life, rather than at a specific age. However, most children require surgery before they reach school age.\", \"An infant with transposition may undergo atrial balloon septostomy (Rashkind procedure) during cardiac catheterization. This procedure enlarges the patent foramen ovale, which improves oxygenation by allowing greater mixing of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Atrial balloon septostomy requires passage of a balloon-tipped catheter through the foramen ovale and subsequent inflation and withdrawal across\\nthe atrial septum. This procedure alleviates hypoxia to a certain degree. Afterward, digoxin and diuretics can lessen heart failure until the infant is ready to withstand corrective surgery (usually between birth and age 1). One of three surgical procedures can correct transposition, depending on the defect's physiology. The Mustard procedure replaces the atrial septum with a Dacron or pericardial partition that allows systemic venous blood to be channeled to the pulmonary artery—which carries the blood to the lungs for oxygenation—and oxygenated blood returning to the heart to be channeled from the pulmonary veins into the aorta. (See Mustard procedure .)\\nThe Senning procedure accomplishes the same result, using the atrial septum to create partitions to redirect blood flow. In the arterial switch, or Jantene procedure, transposed arteries are surgically anastomosed to the correct ventricle. For this procedure to be successful, the left ventricle must be used to pump at systemic pressure, as it does in neonates or in children with a left ventricular outflow obstruction or a large VSD. Surgery also corrects other heart defects.\", \"Treatment includes antibiotics for bacterial infection, modified bed rest to decrease heart workload, and careful management of complications. Inotropic support of cardiac function with amrinone, dopamine, or dobutamine may be needed. Heart failure requires restriction of activity to minimize myocardial oxygen consumption, supplemental oxygen therapy, sodium restriction, diuretics to decrease fluid retention, and cardiac glycosides to increase myocardial contractility. However, cardiac glycosides should be administered cautiously because some patients with myocarditis may show a paradoxical\\nsensitivity to even small doses. Arrhythmias necessitate prompt but cautious administration of antiarrhythmics because these drugs depress myocardial contractility. Thromboembolism requires anticoagulation therapy. Treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants may be used to reduce inflammation, but they haven't been shown to change the progression of myocarditis infections. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated during the acute phase (first 2 weeks) because they increase myocardial damage. Surgical treatment may include left ventricular assistive\\ndevices and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for support of cardiogenic shock. Cardiac transplantation has been beneficial for giant cell myocarditis.\", 'The goal of treatment is to eradicate the infecting organism with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, which should start promptly and continue over 4 to 6 weeks. Selection of an antibiotic is based on identification of the infecting organism and on sensitivity studies. While awaiting results, or if blood cultures are negative, empiric antimicrobial therapy is based on the likely infecting organism. Supportive treatment includes bed rest, aspirin for fever\\nand aches, and sufficient fluid intake. Severe valvular damage, especially aortic or mitral insufficiency, may require corrective surgery if refractory heart failure develops, or in cases requiring that\\nan infected prosthetic valve be replaced.', 'The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and manage the underlying systemic disease. In acute idiopathic pericarditis and postthoracotomy pericarditis, treatment consists of bed rest as long as fever and pain persist, and nonsteroidal drugs, such as aspirin and indomethacin, to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Post-MI patients should avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids because they may interfere with myocardial scar formation. If these drugs fail to relieve symptoms, corticosteroids may be used. Although corticosteroids produce rapid and effective relief, they must be used cautiously because episodes may recur when therapy is discontinued. Infectious pericarditis that results from disease of the left pleural space, mediastinal abscesses, or septicemia requires antibiotics (possibly by direct pericardial injection), surgical drainage, or both. Cardiac tamponade may require pericardiocentesis. Signs of tamponade include pulsus paradoxus, jugular vein distention, dyspnea, and shock. Recurrent pericarditis may necessitate partial pericardectomy, which creates a “window” that allows fluid to drain into\\nthe pleural space. In constrictive pericarditis, total pericardectomy to permit adequate filling and contraction of the heart may be necessary. Treatment must also include management of rheumatic fever, uremia, tuberculosis, and other underlying disorders.', 'Effective management eradicates the streptococcal infection, relieves symptoms, and prevents recurrence, reducing the chance of permanent cardiac damage. During the acute phase, treatment includes penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin. Salicylates such as aspirin relieve fever and minimize joint swelling and pain; if carditis is present or salicylates fail to relieve pain and inflammation, corticosteroids may be used. Supportive treatment requires strict bed rest for about 5 weeks during the acute phase with active carditis, followed by a progressive increase in physical activity, depending on clinical and laboratory findings and the response to treatment. P After the acute phase subsides, low-dose antibiotics may be used to prevent recurrence. Such preventive treatment usually continues for 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer). Heart failure necessitates continued bed rest and diuretics. Severe mitral or aortic valve dysfunction that causes persistent heart failure requires corrective valvular surgery, including commissurotomy (separation of the adherent, thickened leaflets of the mitral valve), valvuloplasty (inflation of a balloon within a valve), or valve replacement (with prosthetic valve). Such surgery is seldom necessary before late adolescence.', \"Treatment depends on the nature and severity of associated symptoms. For example, heart failure requires digoxin, diuretics, a sodium-restricted diet and, in acute cases, oxygen. Other measures may include anticoagulant therapy or antiplatelet medications to prevent thrombus formation around diseased or replaced valves, prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery or\\ndental care, and valvuloplasty. An intra-aortic balloon pump may be used temporarily to reduce backflow by enhancing forward blood flow into\\nthe aorta. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS Hypertensive crisis is a severe rise in arterial blood pressure caused by a disturbance in one or more of the regulating mechanisms. If left untreated, hypertensive crisis may result in renal, cardiac, or cerebral complications and, possibly, death. P If the patient has severe signs and symptoms that can't be managed medically, open heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass for valve repair or replacement is indicated.\", 'The National Institutes of Health recommends the following approach for treating primary hypertension: First, help the patient start needed lifestyle modifications, including weight reduction, moderation of alcohol intake, regular physical exercise, reduction of sodium intake, and smoking cessation. If the patient fails to achieve the desired blood pressure or make significant progress, continue lifestyle modifications and begin drug therapy. For stage 1 hypertension (systolic [SBP] blood pressure 140 to 159 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90 to\\n99 mm Hg) in the absence of compelling indications (heart failure, postmyocardial infarction, high coronary disease risk, diabetes, chronic\\nkidney disease, or recurrent stroke prevention), give most patients thiazide-type diuretics. Consider using an angiotensin-converting enzyme\\n(ACE) inhibitor, beta- adrenergic blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensinreceptor blocker (ARB), or a combination. For stage 2 hypertension (SBP 160 mm Hg, or DBP 100 mm Hg) in the absence of compelling indications, give most patients a two-drug combination (usually a thiazide-type diuretic and an\\nACE inhibitor, ARB, CCB, or beta-adrenergic blocker). If the patient has one or more compelling indications, base drug treatment on benefits from outcome studies or existing clinical guidelines. Treatment may include the following, depending on indication: – Heart failure — diuretic, beta-adrenergic blocker, ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aldosterone antagonist – High coronary disease risk — diuretic, beta-adrenergic blocker, ACE inhibitor, or CCB – Diabetes — diuretic, beta-adrenergic blocker, ACE inhibitor, or CCB – Chronic kidney disease — ACE inhibitor or ARB – Postmyocardial failure — ACE inhibitor, beta-adrenergic blocker, or aldosterone antagonist – Recurrent stroke prevention — diuretic or ACE inhibitor. Give other antihypertensive drugs as needed. If the patient fails to achieve the desired blood pressure, continue lifestyle modifications and optimize drug dosages or add drugs until the goal blood pressure is achieved. Also, consider consultation with a hypertension specialist. Treatment of secondary hypertension focuses on correcting the underlying cause and controlling hypertensive effects. Typically, hypertensive emergencies require parenteral administration of a vasodilator or an adrenergic inhibitor or oral administration of a selected drug, such as nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, or labetalol, to rapidly reduce blood pressure. The initial goal is to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by no more than 25% (within minutes to hours) then to 160/110 within 2 hours while avoiding excessive falls in blood pressure that can precipitate renal, cerebral, or myocardial ischemia. Examples of hypertensive emergencies include hypertensive\\nencephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute left-sided heart failure\\nwith pulmonary edema, and dissecting aortic aneurysm. Hypertensive emergencies are also associated with eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. Hypertension without accompanying symptoms or target-organ disease seldom requires emergency drug therapy.', \"The goal of treatment in patients with angina is to either reduce myocardial oxygen demand or increase oxygen supply. Therapy consists primarily of nitrates such as nitroglycerin (given sublingually, orally, transdermally, or topically in ointment form) to dilate coronary arteries and improve blood supply to the heart. Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors and antithrombin drugs may be used to reduce the risk of blood clots. Beta-adrenergic blockers may be used to decrease heart rate and lower the heart's oxygen use. Calcium channel blockers may be used to relax the coronary arteries and all systemic arteries, reducing the heart's workload. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, or other medications may be used to lower blood pressure. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may\\nbe performed during cardiac catheterization to compress fatty deposits and relieve occlusion in patients with no calcification and partial occlusion. PTCA carries a certain risk but its morbidity is lower than that for surgery. (See Relieving occlusions with angioplasty. ) RELIEVING OCCLUSIONS WITH ANGIOPLASTY Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can open an occluded coronary without opening the chest — an important advantage over bypass surgery. First, coronary angiography must confirm the presence and location of the arterial occlusion. Then, the physician threads a guide catheter through the patient's femoral artery into the coronary artery under fluoroscopic guidance, as shown at right. When angiography shows the guide catheter positioned at the occlusion site, the physician carefully inserts a smaller double-lumen balloon catheter through the guide catheter and directs the\\nballoon through the occlusion (opposite page, left). A marked pressure gradient will be obvious. The physician alternately inflates and deflates the balloon until an angiogram verifies successful arterial dilation (opposite page, right) and the pressure gradient has decreased. P PTCA is an alternative to grafting in elderly patients or\\nin others who can't tolerate cardiac surgery. However, patients who have a left main coronary artery occlusion, lesions in extremely torturous vessels, or occlusions older than 3 months aren't candidates for PTCA. PTCA can be done along with coronary stenting, or stents may be placed alone. Stents provide a framework to hold an artery open by securing the flaps of the tunica media against an artery wall. Intravascular coronary artery stenting is done to reduce the incidence of restenosis. Prostetic cylindral stents made of stainless steel coil are positioned at the site of occlusion. Drug-eluting stents coated with\\nsirolimus or paclitaxel reduce restenosis rates by about 9%. Laser angioplasty corrects occlusion by vaporizing fatty deposits with the eximeter or hot-tipped laser device. Percutaneous myocardial revascularization, or PMR, uses a laser to create channels in\\nthe heart muscle to improve perfusion to the myocardium. A carbon dioxide laser is used to create transmural channels from the epicardium to the myocardium, extending into the left ventricle. This technique is also known as transmyocardial revascularization and appears to be effective for severe symptoms. In addition, a stent may be placed in the\\nartery to act as a scaffold to hold the artery open. Another procedure is rotational atherectomy, which removes arterial plaque with a high-speed burr. Obstructive lesions may necessitate coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the use of vein grafts. P A surgical technique available as an alternative to traditional CABG surgery is minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as “keyhole” surgery. This procedure requires a shorter recovery period and has fewer postoperative complications. Instead of sawing open the patient's sternum and spreading the ribs apart, several small cuts are made in the torso through which small surgical instruments and fiber-optic cameras are inserted. This procedure was initially designed to correct blockages in just one or two\\neasily reached arteries; it may not be suitable for more complicated cases. Coronary brachytherapy, which involves delivering beta or\\ngamma radiation into the coronary arteries, may be used in patients who've undergone stent implantation in a coronary artery but then developed such problems as diffuse in-stent restenosis. Brachytherapy is\\na promising technique, but its use is restricted to the treatment of stentrelated problems because of complications and the unknown long-term\\neffects of the radiation. However, in some facilities, brachytherapy is\\nbeing studied as a first-line treatment of coronary disease. PREVENTION Because CAD is so widespread, prevention is of great importance. Encourage dietary restrictions aimed at great importance. Encourage dietary restrictions aimed at reducing intake of calories (in obesity) and salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol, which serves to minimize the risk, especially when supplemented with regular exercise. Also, encourage patient to stop smoking and to reduce stress. Other preventive actions to encourage include control of hypertension, control of elevated serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels (with antilipemics), and measures to minimize platelet aggregation and the danger of blood clots (with aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs).\", \"The goals of treatment are to relieve chest pain, stabilize heart rhythm, reduce cardiac workload, revascularize the coronary artery, and preserve myocardial tissue. Arrhythmias, the predominant problem during the first 48 hours after the infarction, may require antiarrhythmics, possibly a pacemaker and, rarely, cardioversion. Arrhythmias are best detected using a 12-lead ECG. To preserve myocardial tissue in ST elevation MI, fibrinolytic therapy should be started I.V. within 30 minutes of arrival\\nin the emergency department, if not contraindicated. Fibrinolytic therapy includes a choice of streptokinase, alteplase, urokinase, tenecteplase, or reteplase. (See Comparing thrombolytics, pages 50 and 51.) Primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is\\na Class I recommendation as an alternative to thrombolytic therapy only\\nif performed in a timely manner by physicians skilled in the procedure and supported by experienced personnel in high-volume centers. Other treatments consist of: lidocaine, vasopressin, or amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias, or other drugs, such as procainamide, quinidine, or disopyramide antiplatelet therapy with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel for non- ST-elevation MI atropine I.V. or a temporary pacemaker for heart block or bradycardia nitroglycerin (sublingual, topical, transdermal, or I.V.); calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem (sublingual, oral, or I.V.); or isosorbide dinitrate (sublingual, oral, or I.V.) to relieve pain by redistributing blood to ischemic areas of the myocardium, increasing cardiac output, and reducing myocardial workload heparin I.V. (usually follows thrombolytic therapy) morphine I.V. for pain and sedation bed rest with bedside commode to decrease cardiac workload oxygen administration at a modest flow rate for 2 to 3 hours (a lower concentration is necessary if the patient\\nhas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for patients with large anterior wall MIs and for those with an MI and a\\nleft ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% drugs to increase myocardial contractility or blood pressure beta-adrenergic blockers, such as propranolol or atenolol, after acute MI to help prevent reinfarction by reducing the heart's workload aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation (should be initiated immediately and continued for years) pulmonary artery catheterization to detect\\nleft- or right-sided heart failure and to monitor the patient's response to treatment.\", \"The goal of therapy is to improve pump function by reversing the compensatory mechanisms producing the clinical effects, underlying disorders, and precipitating factors. Heart failure can be quickly controlled by treatment consisting of: LINKING BNP LEVELS TO HEART FAILURE SYMPTOM SEVERITY This chart shows the level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and its correlation with symptoms of heart failure. The higher the level of BNP, the more severe the symptoms. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to decrease peripheral vascular resistance antiembolism stockings to reduce the risk of venostasis and thromboembolus formation bed rest for acute heart failure carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with alpha-receptor blockade to reduce mortality and improve quality of life digoxin or dopamine to strengthen myocardial contractility diuresis to reduce total blood volume and circulatory congestion inotropic agents, such as dobutamine and milrinone, given I.V. to improve the heart's ability to pump nesiritide, a recombinant form of endogenous human B-type natriuretic peptide, to reduce sodium through its diuretic action vasodilators to increase cardiac output by reducing the impedance to ventricular outflow (afterload). Excess fluid can be removed through dialysis if necessary. Circulatory assistance can be provided by implanted devices, such as the intra-aortic balloon pump and the left ventricular assist device, but they're only temporary solutions. P P Left ventricular remodeling surgery may also be performed. This surgical technique involves cutting a wedge about the size of a small slice of pie out of the left ventricle of an enlarged heart. The remainder of the heart is sewn together. The result is a smaller organ that's able to pump blood more efficiently. This procedure\\noffers promising results, especially for those whose only alternative may be a heart transplant. Watch for and treat complications, which typically may include pulmonary edema (see Pulmonary edema: How to intervene );\\nvenostasis, with predisposition to thromboembolism (associated primarily with prolonged bed rest); cerebral insufficiency; and renal insufficiency, with severe electrolyte imbalance.\", \"Therapeutic goals include correcting the underlying causes and improving the heart's pumping ability with digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, and a sodium-restricted diet. Other options may involve bed rest and steroids. Vasodilators reduce preload and afterload, thereby decreasing congestion and increasing cardiac output. Acute heart failure requires vasodilation with nitroprusside or nitroglycerin I.V. Long- term treatment may include prazosin, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and anticoagulants. When these treatments fail, therapy may require a heart transplant for carefully selected patients. Cardiomyoplasty, which wraps\\nthe latissimus dorsi muscle around the ventricles, assists the ventricle P to effectively pump blood. A cardiomyostimulator delivers bursts of electrical impulses during systole to contract the muscle.\", \"The goals of treatment are to relax the ventricle and to relieve outflow tract obstruction. Agents such as propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, slow heart rate and increase ventricular filling by relaxing the obstructing muscle, thereby reducing angina, syncope, dyspnea, and arrhythmias. However, propranolol may aggravate symptoms of cardiac decompensation. Atrial fibrillation necessitates cardioversion to treat the arrhythmia and, because of the high risk of systemic embolism, anticoagulant therapy until fibrillation subsides. Because vasodilators such as nitroglycerin reduce venous return by permitting pooling of blood in the periphery, decreasing ventricular volume and chamber size, and may cause further obstruction, they're contraindicated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also contraindicated are sympathetic stimulators such as isoproterenol, which\\nenhance cardiac contractility and myocardial demands for oxygen, intensifying the obstruction. Although quinidine is used to suppress ventricular arrhythmia, disopyramide is preferred because of its negative inotropic properties. Patients with potentially lethal arrhythmias may need an implantable-cardioverter defibrillator to prevent sudden death. If drug therapy fails, surgery is indicated. Ventricular myotomy (resection of the hypertrophied septum) or ventricular myectomy (removal of the hypertrophied septum) alone or combined with mitral valve replacement may ease outflow tract obstruction and relieve symptoms. However, ventricular myotomy may cause complications, such as complete heart block and ventricular septal defect.\", \"Emergency treatment measures must include prompt and adequate blood and fluid replacement to restore intravascular volume and\\nraise blood pressure. Saline solution or lactated Ringer's solution, then possibly plasma proteins (albumin) or other plasma expanders, may produce adequate volume expansion until whole blood can be matched. A rapid solution infusion system can provide these crystalloids or colloids at high flow rates. Application of a pneumatic antishock garment may be helpful. (See Using a pneumatic antishock garment. )\\nDopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine can help increase\\nblood pressure and cardiac output after fluid resuscitation measures are done. Treatment may also include oxygen administration, identification of bleeding site, control of bleeding by direct measures (such as application of pressure and elevation of a limb) and, possibly, surgery.\", \"The aim of treatment is to enhance cardiovascular status by increasing cardiac output, improving myocardial perfusion, and decreasing cardiac workload with combinations of various cardiovascular drugs and mechanical-assist techniques. Myocardial reperfusion can be accomplished by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stents, thrombolytic therapy, or bypass grafting. Drug therapy may include dopamine I.V., a vasopressor that increases cardiac output, blood pressure, and renal blood flow; amrinone or dobutamine I.V., inotropic agents that increase myocardial contractility; norepinephrine, when a more potent vasoconstrictor is necessary; and nitroprusside I.V., a vasodilator that may be used with a\\nvasopressor to further improve cardiac output by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance (afterload) and reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure P (preload). However, the patient's blood pressure must be adequate to support nitroprusside therapy and must be monitored closely. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical-assist device that attempts to improve coronary artery perfusion and decrease cardiac workload. (See Understanding the IABP. )\\nThe inflatable balloon pump is percutaneously or surgically inserted through the femoral artery into the descending thoracic aorta. The balloon inflates during diastole to increase coronary artery perfusion pressure and deflates before systole (before the aortic valve opens) to reduce resistance to ejection (afterload) and reduce cardiac workload. Improved ventricular ejection, which significantly improves cardiac output, and a subsequent vasodilation in the peripheral vasculature lead\\nto lower preload volume. When drug therapy and IABP insertion fail, treatment may require the use of a ventricular assist device. This device (which may be either temporary or permanent) diverts systemic blood flow from a diseased ventricle into a centrifugal pump. It assists the heart's pumping action rather than replaces it.\", \"Depending on the aneurysm's size and the complications, treatment may necessitate only routine medical examination to follow the\\npatient's condition or aggressive measures for intractable ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and emboli. Emergency treatment of ventricular arrhythmia includes antiarrhythmics I.V. or cardioversion. Preventive treatment continues with oral antiarrhythmics, such as procainamide, quinidine, or disopyramide. Emergency treatment for heart failure with pulmonary edema includes oxygen, cardiac glycosides I.V., furosemide I.V., morphine I.V. and, when necessary, nitroprusside I.V. and intubation. Maintenance therapy may include nitrates, prazosin, and oral hydralazine. Systemic embolization requires anticoagulation therapy or embolectomy. Refractory ventricular tachycardia, heart failure, recurrent arterial embolization, and persistent angina with coronary artery occlusion may necessitate surgery, of which the most effective procedure is aneurysmectomy with myocardial revascularization.\", 'The goal of treatment is to relieve intrapericardial pressure and cardiac compression by removing accumulated blood or fluid.\\nPericardiocentesis (needle aspiration of the pericardial cavity) or surgical creation of an opening (pericardiectomy or pericardial window) dramatically improves systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output with\\naspiration of as little as 25 ml of fluid. Such treatment necessitates continuous hemodynamic and ECG monitoring in the intensive care unit. Trial volume loading with temporary I.V. normal saline solution with albumin, and perhaps an inotropic drug, such as isoproterenol or dopamine, is necessary in the hypotensive patient to maintain cardiac output. Although these drugs normally improve myocardial function, they may further compromise an ischemic myocardium after MI. Depending on the cause of tamponade, additional treatment may include: in traumatic injury—blood transfusion or a thoracotomy to drain reaccumulating fluid or to repair bleeding sites in heparin-induced tamponade—the heparin antagonist protamine sulfate in warfarin-induced tamponade— vitamin K. Resection of a portion or all of the pericardium to allow\\nfull communication with the pleura may be needed if repeated pericardiocentesis fails to prevent recurrence.', \"Dissecting aortic aneurysm is an emergency that requires prompt surgery and stabilizing measures: antihypertensives such as nitroprusside; negative inotropic agents that decrease contractility force such as propranolol; oxygen for respiratory distress; opioids for pain; I.V. fluids and, possibly, whole blood transfusions. Surgery consists of resecting the aneurysm, restoring normal blood flow through a Dacron or Teflon graft replacement and, with\\naortic valve insufficiency, replacing the aortic valve. Groin catheter placement may be used for aortic stenting. This procedure, which may be used for aneurysms of the descending aorta, eliminates the need for a chest incision. Postoperative measures include careful monitoring and continuous assessment in the intensive care unit, antibiotics, endotracheal (ET) and chest tubes, ECG monitoring, and pulmonary artery catheterization. P Long-term management includes treatment of underlying conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. TYPES OF AORTIC ANEURYSMS Saccular Unilateral pouchlike bulge with a narrow neck Fusiform A spindle-shaped bulge encompassing the vessel's entire diameter Dissecting A hemorrhagic separation of the medial layer of the vessel wall, which creates a false lumen False aneurysm A pulsating hematoma resulting from trauma; usually seen in the femoral artery after catheterization\", 'Usually, abdominal aneurysm requires resection of the aneurysm and replacement of the damaged aortic section with a Dacron graft. (See Abdominal aneurysms: Before and after surgery, page 86. Also see Endovascular grafting for repair of an AAA, page 87.) If the aneurysm is small and asymptomatic, surgery may be delayed and the aneurysm may be followed and allowed to expand to a certain size because of possible surgical complications; however, small aneurysms may also rupture. Because of this risk, surgical repair or replacement is recommended for symptomatic patients or for patients with aneurysms greater than 5 cm in diameter. Stenting is also a treatment option. It can be performed without an abdominal incision by introducing the catheters through arteries in the groin. However, not all patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms are candidates for this treatment. Regular physical examination and ultrasound checks are necessary to detect enlargement, which may forewarn rupture. Large aneurysms or those that produce symptoms pose a significant risk of rupture and necessitate immediate repair. In patients with poor distal runoff, external grafting may be done. Risk factor modification is fundamental in the medical management of abdominal aneurysm, including control of hypocholesterolemia and hypertension. Beta-adrenergic blockers are commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of aneurysm expansion and rupture.', 'Femoral and popliteal aneurysms require surgical bypass and reconstruction of the artery, usually with an autogenous saphenous vein graft replacement. Arterial occlusion that causes severe ischemia and gangrene may require leg amputation.', \"The goals of treatment are to control thrombus development, prevent complications, relieve pain, and prevent recurrence\\nof the disorder. Symptomatic measures include bed rest, with elevation of the affected arm or leg; warm, moist soaks to the affected area; and analgesics. After the acute episode of DVT subsides, the patient may resume activity while wearing antiembolism stockings that were applied before he got out of bed. Treatment also includes anticoagulants (initially, heparin; later, warfarin) to prolong clotting time. Low-molecular-weight\\n(LMW) heparin has been shown to be effective in treating DVT. Although LMW heparin is more expensive, it doesn't require monitoring for its anticoagulant effect. Full anticoagulant doses must be discontinued during any operative period because of the risk of hemorrhage. After some types of surgery, especially major abdominal or pelvic operations, prophylactic doses of anticoagulants may reduce the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. For lysis of acute, extensive DVT, treatment should include streptokinase. Rarely, DVT may cause complete venous occlusion, which necessitates venous interruption through simple ligation to vein plication, or clipping. Embolectomy and insertion of a vena caval umbrella or filter may also be done. Therapy for severe superficial thrombophlebitis may include an anti-inflammatory drug such as indomethacin, antiembolism stockings, warm soaks, and elevation of the leg. P\", 'Initially, treatment consists of avoidance of cold, mechanical, or chemical injury; cessation of smoking; and reassurance that symptoms are benign. Because adverse drug effects, especially from vasodilators, may be more bothersome than the disease itself, drug therapy is reserved for unusually severe symptoms. Such therapy may include phenoxybenzamine or reserpine; low doses of nifedipine have been\\nshown to be effective. Sympathectomy may be helpful when conservative modalities fail to prevent ischemic ulcers and becomes necessary in less\\nthan 25% of patients.', 'The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Such therapy may include an exercise program that uses gravity to fill and drain the blood vessels or, in severe disease, P a lumbar sympathectomy to increase blood supply to the skin. Aspirin and vasodilators may also be used. Amputation may be necessary for nonhealing ulcers, intractable pain, or gangrene.', \"Treatment depends on the obstruction's cause, location, and size. For mild chronic disease, supportive measures include elimination of smoking, hypertension control, and walking exercise. For carotid artery occlusion, antiplatelet therapy may begin with ticlopidine or clopidogrel and aspirin. For intermittent claudication of\\nchronic occlusive disease, pentoxifylline and cilostazol may improve blood flow through the capillaries, particularly for patients who are poor candidates for surgery. Acute peripheral artery disease usually requires surgery to restore circulation to the affected area, for example: Atherectomy—Excision of plaque using a drill or slicing mechanism. Balloon angioplasty—Compression of the obstruction using balloon inflation. Bypass graft—Blood flow is diverted through an anastomosed autogenous or Dacron graft past the thrombosed segment. Combined therapy—Concomitant use of any of the above treatments. Embolectomy—A balloon-tipped Fogarty catheter is used to remove thrombotic material from the artery. Embolectomy is used mainly for mesenteric, femoral, or popliteal artery occlusion. Laser angioplasty—Use of excision and hot tip lasers to vaporize the obstruction. Lumbar sympathectomy—An adjunct to surgery, depending on the sympathetic nervous system's condition. Patch grafting—This procedure involves removal of the thrombosed arterial segment and replacement with an autogenous vein or Dacron graft. Stents—Insertion of a mesh of wires that stretch and mold to the arterial wall to prevent reocclusion. This new adjunct follows laser angioplasty or atherectomy. Thromboendarterectomy—Opening of the occluded artery and direct removal of the obstructing thrombus and the medial layer of the arterial wall; usually performed after angiography and commonly used with autogenous vein or Dacron bypass surgery (femoral-popliteal or aortofemoral). Thrombolytic therapy—Lysis of any clot around or in the plaque by urokinase, streptokinase, or alteplase. P TYPES OF PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE Site of occlusion Signs and symptoms Carotid arterial system ▪ Internal carotids ▪ External carotids ▪ Absent or decreased pulsation with an auscultatory bruit over the affected vessels ▪ Neurologic dysfunction: transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) due to reduced cerebral circulation producing unilateral sensory or motor dysfunction (transient monocular blindness, and hemiparesis), possible aphasia or dysarthria, confusion, decreased mentation, and headache (These are recurrent features that usually last 5 to 10 minutes but may persist up to 24 hours and may herald a stroke.) Vertebrobasilar system ▪ Vertebral arteries ▪ Basilar arteries ▪\\nNeurologic dysfunction: TIAs of the brain stem and cerebellum producing\\nbinocular vision disturbances, vertigo, dysarthria, and “drop attacks” (falling down without loss of consciousness); less common than carotid TIA Innominate ▪ Brachiocephalic artery ▪ Indications of ischemia (claudication) of the right arm ▪ Neurologic dysfunction: signs and symptoms of vertebro-basilar occlusion ▪ Possible bruit over the right side of the neck Subclavian artery ▪ Clinical effects of vertebrobasilar occlusion and exercise-induced arm claudication ▪ Subclavian steal syndrome (characterized by the backflow of blood from the brain through the vertebral artery on the same side as the occlusion, into the subclavian artery distal to the occlusion) ▪ Possibly gangrene (usually limited to the digits) Mesenteric artery ▪ Superior (most commonly affected) ▪ Celiac axis ▪ Inferior ▪ Bowel ischemia, infarct necrosis, and gangrene ▪ Diarrhea ▪ Leukocytosis ▪ Nausea and vomiting ▪ Shock due to massive intraluminal fluid and plasma loss ▪ Sudden, acute abdominal pain Aortic bifurcation (saddle block occlusion, a medical emergency associated with cardiac embolization) ▪ Sensory and motor deficits (muscle weakness, numbness, paresthesias, and paralysis) in both legs ▪ Signs of ischemia (sudden pain and cold, pale legs with decreased or absent peripheral pulses) in both legs Iliac artery (Leriche's syndrome) ▪ Absent or reduced femoral or distal pulses ▪ Impotence ▪ Intermittent claudication of the lower back, buttocks, and thighs, relieved by rest ▪ Possible bruit over femoral arteries Femoral and popliteal artery (associated with aneurysm formation) ▪ Gangrene ▪ Intermittent claudication of the calves on exertion ▪ Ischemic pain in feet ▪ Leg pallor and coolness; blanching of the feet on elevation ▪ No palpable pulses in the ankles and feet ▪ Pretrophic pain (heralds necrosis and ulceration) Amputation becomes necessary with failure of arterial reconstructive surgery or with the development of gangrene, persistent infection, or intractable pain. Other therapy includes heparin to prevent emboli (for embolic occlusion) and bowel resection after restoration of blood flow (for mesenteric artery occlusion).\"], 'Special considerations': [\"Although the parents of an infant with VSD often suspect something is wrong with their child before diagnosis, they need psychological support to help them accept the reality of a serious cardiac disorder. Because surgery may take place months after diagnosis,\\nparent teaching is vital to prevent P complications until the child is scheduled for surgery or the defect closes. Thorough explanations of all\\ntests are also essential. Instruct parents to watch for signs of heart failure, such as poor feeding, sweating, and heavy breathing. If the child is receiving digoxin or other\\nmedications, tell the parents how to give it and how to recognize adverse effects. Caution them to keep medications out of the reach of all children. Teach parents to recognize and report early signs of infection and to avoid exposing the child to people with obvious infections. Encourage parents to let the child engage in normal activities. Tell parents to follow-up with their pediatrician. Also tell them that child life therapy may be appropriate if their child displays delayed growth and development or failure to thrive. Stress the importance of prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery. After surgery to correct VSD: Monitor vital signs and intake and output.\\nMaintain the infant's body temperature with an overbed warmer. Give catecholamines, nitroprusside, and diuretics, as ordered; analgesics as needed. Monitor central venous pressure, intra-arterial blood pressure, and left atrial or pulmonary artery pressure readings. Assess heart rate and rhythm for signs of conduction block. Check oxygenation, particularly in a child\\nwho requires mechanical ventilation. Suction to maintain a patent airway and to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, as needed. Monitor pacemaker effectiveness if needed. Watch for signs of failure, such as bradycardia and hypotension. Reassure parents and allow them to participate in their child's care.\", \"Before cardiac catheterization, explain pretest and posttest procedures to the child and her parents. If possible, use drawings or other visual aids to explain it to the child. As needed, teach the patient about prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis. (They may be\\nadministered before dental or other invasive procedures.) If surgery is scheduled, teach the child and her parents about the intensive care unit and introduce them to the staff. Show parents where they can wait during the operation. Explain postoperative procedures, tubes, dressings, and monitoring equipment. After surgery, closely monitor the patient's vital signs, central venous and intra-arterial pressures, and intake and output. Watch for atrial arrhythmias, which may remain uncorrected.\", 'Palpate the pulses in the legs in newborns and at well-baby visits to detect absent or diminished pulses. When coarctation in an infant requires rapid digitalization, monitor vital signs closely and watch for digoxin toxicity (poor feeding and vomiting). Balance intake and output carefully, especially if the infant is receiving diuretics with fluid restriction. P Because the infant may not be able to maintain proper body temperature, regulate environmental temperature with an overbed warmer if needed. Monitor blood glucose levels to detect possible hypoglycemia, which may occur as glycogen stores become depleted. Offer the parents emotional support and an\\nexplanation of the disorder. Also explain diagnostic procedures, surgery, and drug therapy. Tell parents what to expect postoperatively. For an older child, assess the blood pressure in his extremities regularly, explain any exercise restrictions, stress the need to take medications properly and to watch for adverse effects, and teach him about tests and other procedures. After corrective surgery: Monitor blood pressure closely, using an intra-arterial line. Measure blood pressure in arms and legs. Monitor intake and output. If the patient develops hypertension and requires nitroprusside or trimethaphan, administer it, as ordered, by continuous I.V. infusion, using an infusion pump. Watch for severe hypotension and regulate the dosage carefully. Provide pain relief and encourage a gradual increase in activity. Promote adequate respiratory functioning through turning, coughing, and deep breathing. Watch for abdominal pain or rigidity and signs of GI or urinary bleeding. If an older child needs to continue antihypertensives after surgery, teach him and his parents about them. Stress the importance of continued endocarditis prophylaxis.', \"PDA necessitates careful monitoring, patient and family teaching, and emotional support. Watch carefully for signs of PDA in all premature neonates. Be alert for respiratory distress symptoms\\nresulting from heart failure, which may develop rapidly in a premature neonate. Frequently assess vital signs, ECG, electrolyte levels, and intake and output. Record response to diuretics and other therapy. Watch\\nfor signs of digoxin toxicity (poor feeding and vomiting). If the infant receives indomethacin for ductus closure, watch for possible adverse effects, such as diarrhea, jaundice, bleeding, and renal dysfunction. Before surgery, carefully explain all treatments and tests to parents. Include the child in your explanations.\\nArrange for the child and her parents to meet the intensive care unit staff. Tell them about expected I.V. lines, monitoring equipment, and postoperative procedures. Immediately after surgery, the child may have a central venous pressure catheter and an arterial line in place. Carefully assess vital signs, intake and output, and arterial and venous\\npressures. Provide pain relief as needed. Before discharge, review instructions to the parents about activity restrictions based on the child's tolerance and energy levels. Advise parents not to become overprotective as their child's tolerance for physical activity increases. Stress the need for regular follow-up examinations. Advise parents to inform any practitioner who treats their\\nchild about his history of surgery for PDA—even if the child is being treated for an unrelated medical problem. CONGENITAL CYANOTIC DEFECTS\", \"Explain tetralogy of Fallot to the parents. Inform them that their child will set his own exercise limits and will know when to rest. Make sure they understand that their child can engage in physical activity, and advise them not to be overprotective. Teach the parents to recognize serious hypoxic spells, which can dramatically increase cyanosis; deep, sighing respirations; and loss of consciousness. Tell them to place their child in the knee- chest position and to report such spells immediately. Emergency treatment may be necessary. Instruct the parents on ways to prevent overexerting their child, such as feeding him slowly and providing smaller and more frequent meals. Tell them that remaining calm may decrease his anxiety and that anticipating his needs may minimize crying. Encourage the parents to recruit other family members in the care of the child to help prevent their own exhaustion. To prevent infective endocarditis and other infections, warn the parents to keep their child away from people with infections. Urge them to encourage good dental hygiene, and tell them to watch for ear, nose, and throat infections and dental caries, all of which necessitate immediate treatment. When dental care, infections, or surgery requires prophylactic antibiotics, tell the parents to make sure the child completes the prescribed regimen. If the child requires medical attention for an unrelated problem, advise the parents to inform the practitioner immediately of the child's history of tetralogy of Fallot because any treatment must take this serious heart defect into consideration. P During hospitalization, alert the staff to\\nthe child's condition. Because of the right-to-left shunt through the VSD, treat I.V. lines like arterial lines. A clot dislodged from a catheter tip in a vein can cross the VSD and cause cerebral embolism. The same thing can happen if air enters the venous lines. After palliative surgery: Monitor oxygenation and arterial blood gas (ABG) values closely in the intensive care unit. If the child has undergone the Blalock-Taussig procedure, don't use the arm on the operative side for measuring blood pressure, inserting I.V. lines, or drawing blood samples, because blood perfusion on this side diminishes greatly until collateral circulation develops. Note this on the child's chart and at his bedside. After corrective surgery: Watch for right bundle-branch block or more serious disturbances of atrioventricular conduction and for ventricular ectopic beats. Be alert for other postoperative complications, such as bleeding, right-sided heart failure, and respiratory failure. After surgery, transient heart failure is common and may require treatment with digoxin and diuretics. Monitor left atrial pressure directly. A pulmonary artery catheter may also be used to check central venous and pulmonary artery pressures. Frequently check color and vital signs. Obtain ABG measurements regularly to assess oxygenation. Suction to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, as needed. Monitor mechanical ventilation. Monitor and record intake and output accurately. If atrioventricular block develops with a low heart rate, a temporary external pacemaker may be necessary. If blood pressure or cardiac output is inadequate, catecholamines may be ordered by continuous I.V. infusion. To decrease left ventricular workload, administer nitroprusside, if ordered, and provide analgesics, as needed. Keep the parents informed about their child's progress. After discharge, the child may require digoxin, diuretics, and other drugs. Stress the importance of complying with the prescribed regimen and make sure the parents know how and when to administer these medications. Teach the parents to watch for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, and vomiting). Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis will still be required. Advise the parents to avoid becoming overprotective as the child's tolerance for physical activity rises.\", \"Explain cardiac catheterization and all necessary procedures to the parents. Offer emotional support. Monitor vital signs, ABG values, urine output, and central venous pressure, watching for signs of heart failure. Give digoxin and I.V. fluids, being careful to avoid fluid overload. Teach the parents to recognize signs of heart failure and digoxin toxicity (poor feeding and vomiting). Stress the importance of regular checkups to monitor cardiovascular status. Teach the parents to protect their infant from infection and to give antibiotics. Tell the parents to let their child develop normally. They need not restrict activities; he'll set his own limits. If the patient is scheduled for surgery, explain the procedure to the parents and child, if old enough. Teach them about the intensive care unit and introduce them to the staff. Also\\nexplain postoperative care. Preoperatively, monitor ABG values, acid-base balance, intake and output, and vital signs. After corrective surgery: Monitor cardiac output by checking blood pressure, skin color, heart rate, urine output, central venous and left atrial pressures, and level of consciousness. Report abnormalities or changes. Carefully monitor ABG levels and report changes in trends. To detect supraventricular conduction blocks and arrhythmias, monitor the patient closely. Watch for signs of atrioventricular blocks, atrial arrhythmias, and faulty sinoatrial function. After Mustard or Senning procedures, watch for signs of baffle obstruction such as marked facial edema. Encourage parents to help their child assume new activity levels and independence. Teach them about postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis. MUSTARD PROCEDURE P In the Mustard procedure, a Dacron patch (1) is sutured in the excised atrial septum (2) to divert pulmonary venous return to the tricuspid valve and systemic venous return to the mitral valve (3). ACQUIRED INFLAMMATORY HEART DISEASE\", 'Assess cardiovascular status frequently, watching for signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia. Check for changes in cardiac rhythm or conduction. Observe for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and cardiac arrhythmias) and for complicating factors that may potentiate toxicity, such as electrolyte imbalance or hypoxia. Stress the importance of bed rest. Assist with bathing, as necessary; provide a bedside commode because this stresses the heart less than using a bedpan. Reassure the patient that activity limitations are temporary. Offer diversional activities that are physically undemanding. During recovery, recommend that the patient resume normal activities slowly and avoid competitive sports. PREVENTION Instruct patient to obtain prompt treatment of causative disorders. Instruct patient to practice good hygiene, including thorough hand-washing. P Tell patient to thoroughly wash and cook food.', \"Before giving antibiotics, obtain a patient history of allergies. Administer antibiotics on time to maintain\\nconsistent antibiotic blood levels. Observe for signs of infiltration or inflammation at the venipuncture site, possible complications of long-term I.V. drug administration. To reduce the risk of these complications, rotate venous access sites. Watch for signs of embolization (hematuria, pleuritic chest pain, left upper quadrant pain, or paresis),\\na common occurrence during the first 3 months of treatment. Tell the patient to watch for and report these signs, which may indicate impending peripheral vascular occlusion or splenic, renal, cerebral, or pulmonary infarction. Monitor the patient's renal status (blood urea nitrogen levels, creatinine clearance, and urine output) to check for signs of renal emboli or evidence of drug toxicity. Observe for signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles, jugular vein distention, edema, and weight gain. Provide reassurance by teaching the patient and his family about this disease and the need for prolonged treatment. Tell them to watch closely for fever, anorexia, and other signs of relapse about 2 weeks after treatment stops. Suggest quiet diversionary activities to prevent excessive physical exertion. Make sure susceptible patients understand the need for prophylactic antibiotics before, during, and after dental work, childbirth, and genitourinary, GI, or gynecologic procedures. Teach patients how to recognize symptoms of endocarditis and tell them to notify the practitioner at once if such\\nsymptoms occur. (See Preventing endocarditis. ) PREVENTION ENDOCARDITIS Any patient who is at risk for or susceptible to endocarditis, such as those with valvular defects, murmurs, or other predisposing factors, should have prophylactic antibiotics before dental\\nor other invasive procedures. In addition, the patient should practice good hygiene, including thoroughly washing his hands and washing fruits and vegetables\\nand thoroughly cooking all food to prevent introducing organisms into his system. Maintaining good oral health by daily brushing and flossing and having regular dental checkups can also prevent infection. Be sure to advise the patient to notify his family practitioner as well as his dentist or another specialist that he has a condition that places him at\\nhigh risk for endocarditis.\", 'A patient with pericarditis needs complete bed rest. In addition, health care includes: assessing pain in relation to respiration and body position to distinguish pericardial pain from myocardial ischemic pain placing the patient in an upright position\\nto relieve dyspnea and chest pain; providing analgesics and oxygen; and\\nreassuring the patient with acute pericarditis that his condition is temporary and treatable monitoring for signs of cardiac compression or cardiac tamponade, possible complications of pericardial effusion (Signs include decreased blood pressure, increased central venous pressure, P and pulsus paradoxus. Because cardiac tamponade requires immediate treatment, keep a pericardiocentesis set handy whenever pericardial effusion is suspected.) explaining tests and treatments to the patient. (If surgery is necessary, he should learn deep- breathing and coughing exercises beforehand. Postoperative care is similar to that given after cardiothoracic surgery.)', \"Because rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease require prolonged treatment, the care plan should include comprehensive patient teaching to promote compliance with the prescribed therapy. Before giving penicillin, ask the patient or his parents if he has ever had a hypersensitive reaction to it. If he\\nhasn't, warn that such a reaction is possible. Tell them to stop the drug and call the practitioner immediately if he develops a rash, fever,\\nchills, or other signs of allergy at any time during penicillin therapy. Instruct the patient and his family to watch for and report early signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea and a\\nhacking, nonproductive cough. Stress the need for bed rest during the acute phase and suggest appropriate, physically undemanding diversions. After the acute phase, encourage his family and friends to spend as much time as possible with the patient to minimize boredom. Advise his parents to secure tutorial services to help the child keep up with schoolwork during the long convalescence. Help his parents overcome any guilt feelings they may have about their child's illness. Tell them that failure to seek treatment for streptococcal infection is common because this illness often seems no worse than a cold. Encourage the child and his parents to vent their frustrations during the long, tedious recovery. If the child has severe carditis, help them prepare for permanent changes in his lifestyle. Teach the patient and his family about this disease and its treatment. Warn parents to watch for and immediately report signs of recurrent streptococcal infection—sudden sore throat, diffuse throat redness and oropharyngeal exudate, swollen and tender cervical lymph glands, pain on swallowing, temperature of 101° to 104° F (38.3° to 40° C), headache, and nausea. Urge them to keep\\nthe child away from people with respiratory tract infections. Promote good dental hygiene to prevent gingival infection. Make sure the patient and his family understand the need to comply with prolonged antibiotic therapy and follow-up care and the need for additional antibiotics during dental surgery or procedures.\\nArrange for a home health nurse to oversee home care if necessary. Teach the patient to follow current recommendations of the American Heart Association for prevention of bacterial endocarditis. Antibiotic regimens used to prevent recurrence of acute rheumatic fever are inadequate for preventing bacterial endocarditis. VALVE DISORDERS\", 'Watch closely for signs of heart failure or pulmonary edema and for adverse effects of drug therapy. Teach the patient about diet restrictions, medications, and the importance of consistent follow-up care. If the patient has surgery, watch for hypotension, arrhythmias, and thrombus formation. Monitor vital signs, arterial blood gas values, intake, output, daily weight, blood chemistries, chest X-rays, and pulmonary artery catheter readings. DEGENERATIVE CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS P', \"To encourage adherence to antihypertensive\\ntherapy, suggest that the patient establish a daily routine for taking his medication. Warn that uncontrolled hypertension may cause stroke and\\nheart attack. Tell him to report adverse drug effects. Also, advise him\\nto avoid high-sodium antacids and over-the-counter cold and sinus medications, which contain harmful vasoconstrictors. Encourage a change in dietary habits. Help\\nthe obese patient plan a weightreduction diet; tell him to avoid high-sodium foods (pickles, potato chips, canned soups, and cold cuts) and table salt. Help the patient examine and modify his lifestyle (for example, by reducing stress and exercising regularly). If a patient is hospitalized with hypertension, find out if he was taking his prescribed medication. If he\\nwasn't, ask why. If he can't afford the medication, refer him to appropriate social service agencies. Tell the patient and his family to keep a record of drugs used in the past, noting P especially which ones were or weren't effective. Suggest recording this information on a card so that the patient can show it to his practitioner. When routine blood pressure screening reveals elevated pressure, first make sure the cuff size is appropriate for the patient's upper arm circumference. Take the pressure in both arms in lying, sitting, and standing positions. Ask the patient if he smoked, drank a beverage containing caffeine, or was emotionally upset before the test. Advise him to return for blood pressure testing at frequent and regular intervals. To help identify hypertension and prevent untreated hypertension, participate in public education programs dealing\\nwith hypertension and ways to reduce risk factors. Encourage public participation in blood pressure screening programs. Routinely screen all\\npatients, especially those at risk (blacks and people with family histories of hypertension, stroke, or heart attack). (See Preventing hypertension. ) PREVENTING HYPERTENSION Certain risk factors for hypertension can't be changed, such as family history, race, and aging; but lifestyle modifications can\\nhelp prevent hypertension. Based on American Heart Association recommendations, advise your patient to do the following: Maintain a healthy weight Maintain a normal weight or lose weight if overweight. Weight loss lowers blood pressure. Reduce salt Salt intake should be reduced to about 1.5 g per day. Reducing salt intake can lower blood pressure in individuals with and without hypertension. Increase potassium Patients should eat 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day to increase potassium intake. Potassium reduces blood\\npressure in individuals with and without hypertension. Those with kidney disease or heart failure should contact their practitioner before\\nincreasing their potassium intake. Limit alcohol intake Studies have shown a correlation with alcohol intake and increased blood pressure, especially in individuals who drink more than 2\\ndrinks per day. Include exercise Regular physical activity is defined by the American Heart Association as moderate to vigorous exercise for 30 to 60 minutes a\\nday on most or all days of the week. A lack of physical activity can lead to obesity and increase the risk of hypertension, heart attack, and\\nstroke. Manage stress Stress can lead to increased alcohol consumption, smoking, overeating, and other activities that increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Daily relaxation for short periods during the workday and on weekends can also lower blood pressure. Stop smoking Smoking even filtered and light or ultra cigarettes can lead to atherosclerosis. Quitting or not starting is the only way to prevent this major risk factor for heart P attack and stroke. Follow the DASH diet The dietary approaches to stopping hypertension (DASH) diet encourages vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy as well as whole grains, fish, poultry, and nuts. Discourage the eating of fats, red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages. However, individuals with reduced kidney function should always consult their practitioners before\\nstarting this diet; it's rich in potassium which isn't recommended for individuals with these disorders.\", \"During anginal episodes, monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Take an ECG during anginal episodes and before administering nitroglycerin or other nitrates. Record duration of pain, amount of medication required to relieve it, and accompanying symptoms. Keep nitroglycerin available for immediate\\nuse. Instruct the patient to call immediately whenever he feels chest, arm, or neck pain. Before cardiac catheterization, explain the procedure to the patient. Make sure he knows why it's necessary, understands the risks, and realizes that it may indicate a need for surgery. After catheterization, review the expected\\ncourse of treatment with the patient and his family. Monitor the catheter site for bleeding. Also, check for distal pulses. To counter the dye's diuretic effect, make sure the patient drinks plenty of fluids. Assess potassium levels. If the patient is scheduled for surgery, explain the procedure to him and his family. Give them a tour of the intensive care unit and introduce them to the staff. After surgery, monitor blood pressure, intake and output, breath sounds, chest tube drainage, and ECG, watching\\nfor signs of ischemia and arrhythmias. Also, observe for and treat chest pain and possible dye reactions. Give vigorous chest physiotherapy\\nand guide the patient in removal of secretions through deep-breathing, coughing, and expectoration of mucus. Before discharge, stress the need to follow the prescribed drug regimen (antihypertensives, nitrates, and antilipemics, for example), exercise program, and diet. Encourage regular, moderate exercise. Refer the patient to a self-help program to stop smoking.\", \"Care for patients who have suffered an MI is directed toward detecting complications, preventing further myocardial damage, and promoting comfort, rest, and emotional well-being. Most MI patients receive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), where they're under constant observation for complications. On admission to the ICU, monitor and record the patient's ECG, blood pressure, temperature, and heart and breath sounds. Assess and record the severity and duration of pain, and administer analgesics. Avoid I.M. injections; absorption from the muscle is unpredictable and bleeding is likely if the patient is receiving thrombolytic therapy. Check the patient's blood pressure after giving nitroglycerin, especially the first dose. Frequently monitor the ECG to detect rate changes or arrhythmias. Place rhythm strips in the patient's chart periodically for evaluation. P P During episodes of chest pain, obtain 12-lead ECG (before and after nitroglycerin therapy as well), blood pressure, and pulmonary artery catheter measurements and monitor them for changes. Watch for signs and symptoms of fluid retention (crackles, cough, tachypnea, and edema), which may indicate impending heart failure. Carefully monitor daily weight, intake and output, respirations, serum enzyme levels, and blood pressure. Auscultate for adventitious breath sounds periodically (patients on bed rest frequently have atelectatic crackles, which disappear after coughing), for S 3 or S 4 gallops, and for new-onset heart murmurs. Organize patient care and activities to maximize periods of uninterrupted rest. Initiate a cardiac rehabilitation program.\\nThis usually includes education regarding heart disease, exercise, and emotional support for the patient and his family. Ask the dietary department to provide a clear liquid diet until nausea subsides. A low-cholesterol, low-sodium, low-fat, high-fiber diet may be prescribed. Provide a stool softener to prevent straining during defecation, which causes vagal stimulation and may slow\\nthe heart rate. Allow use of a bedside commode and provide as much privacy as possible. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. If the patient is completely immobilized by a severe MI, turn him often. Antiembolism stockings help prevent venostasis and thrombophlebitis. Provide emotional support and help reduce stress and anxiety; administer tranquilizers as needed. Explain procedures and answer questions. Explaining the ICU environment and routine can ease anxiety. Involve the patient's family in his care as much as possible. COMPARING THROMBOLYTICS If your patient has suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), you must intervene promptly to minimize cardiac damage and avert death. If appropriate, prepare the patient for thrombolytic therapy as ordered. Thrombolytic drugs enhance the body's natural ability to dispose of blood clots. To lyse (dissolve) fibrin, the essential component of a clot, tissue activators convert plasminogen to plasmin. A\\nnonspecific protease, plasmin degrades fibrin, fibrinogen, and procoagulant factors (such as factors V, VII, and XII). Candidates for thrombolytic therapy include patients with\\nacute ST-segment elevation and chest pain that has lasted no more than 6\\nhours. Timely use of thrombolytic agents can restore myocardial perfusion and prevent further injury. When effective, thrombolytic agents relieve chest pain, restore the ST segment to baseline, and induce reperfusion arrhythmias within 30 to 45 minutes. Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include surgery\\nwithin the past 2 months, active bleeding, a history of stroke, intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or uncontrolled hypertension. Here's how selected thrombolytics open occluded coronary arteries in patients with an acute MI. Alteplase (Activase) This naturally occurring enzyme has been cloned and produced as a drug, alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator). Binding to\\nplasminogen, it catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin in the presence of fibrin. Because of its strong affinity for fibrin, alteplase concentrates at the clot site, resulting in a minimal decrease\\nin the fibrinogen level. This thrombolytic has a half-life of 5 minutes, so maintaining coronary artery patency depends on continued anticoagulation\\nwith heparin. Alteplase doesn't induce antigenic responses; doses may be repeated at any time. Reteplase (Retevase) Reteplase, recombinant plasminogen activator, has a half-life of 13 to 16 minutes. Its longer half-life allows it to be administered as a bolus. Two boluses are required. Anistreplase (Eminase) Anistreplase is a partially synthetic thrombolytic drug that's composed of a complex of streptokinase bound to human plasminogen. This complex binds to fibrin and promotes plasminogen conversion to plasmin. But the dose needed to lyse coronary artery clots\\ncan cause systemic clot lysis, characterized by fibrinogen depletion. This results in bleeding complications. Anistreplase has the longest half-life (90 minutes). Because it's partially composed of streptokinase, a foreign protein, anistreplase is antigenic and may cause an allergic reaction. The per-dose cost is less than that for alteplase. This drug's main advantage is ease of administration: only a single bolus is required. Streptokinase (Streptase) Streptokinase, a thrombolytic, is a bacterial protein that binds to circulating plasminogen and catalyzes plasmin formation. Its low specificity for fibrin induces a systemic lytic state and increases the risk of bleeding. The half-life is approximately 20 minutes. Like anistreplase, streptokinase is antigenic. Tenecteplase (TNKase) Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. It's given as a single bolus dose. Urokinase (Abbokinase) Naturally produced by the human kidney, urokinase promotes thrombolysis by directly activating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. With a serum half-life of 10 to 20 minutes, urokinase is rapidly cleared by the kidneys and liver. Unlike anistreplase and streptokinase, it doesn't induce an antigenic response. Urokinase isn't given through a peripheral I.V. line to treat an acute MI, but patients who undergo cardiac catheterization may receive it directly in a coronary artery. To prepare the patient for discharge: Thoroughly explain dosages and therapy to promote compliance with the prescribed medication regimen and other treatment measures.Warn about drug adverse effects and advise the patient to watch for and report signs of toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and yellow vision, for example, if the patient is receiving digoxin). P Review dietary restrictions with the patient. If he must follow a low-sodium or low-fat and low- cholesterol diet, provide a list of foods that he should avoid. Ask the dietitian to\\nspeak to the patient and his family. Counsel the patient to resume sexual activity progressively. Advise the patient to report typical or atypical chest pain. Postinfarction syndrome may develop, producing chest pain that must be differentiated from recurrent MI, pulmonary infarct, or heart failure. If the patient has a Holter monitor in place, explain its purpose and use. Stress the need to stop smoking. Encourage participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Review follow-up procedures, such as office visits and treadmill testing, with the patient. PREVENTION Instruct patient to practice healthy-heart living, with a hearthealthy diet, regular exercise, stress reduction and preventive care, maintaining a healthy weight, smoking cessation, and abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs, especially cocaine. Suggest a daily aspirin regimen for patients with coronary artery disease or history of an MI.\", \"During the acute phase of heart failure: Place the patient in Fowler's position and give him supplemental oxygen to help him breathe more easily. Weigh the patient daily and check for peripheral edema. Carefully monitor I.V. intake and urine output, vital signs, and mental status. Auscultate the heart for abnormal sounds (S3 gallop) and the lungs for crackles or rhonchi. Report changes at once. Frequently monitor blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and serum potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels. Make sure the patient has continuous cardiac monitoring during acute and advanced stages to identify and treat arrhythmias promptly. To reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis\\ndue to vascular congestion, assist the patient with range-of-motion exercises. Enforce bed rest and apply antiembolism stockings. Check regularly for calf pain and tenderness. Allow adequate rest periods. PULMONARY EDEMA: HOW TO INTERVENE Obtain the patient history, assist with diagnostic tests, and assess respiratory, mental, and cardiovascular status. To prepare the patient for discharge: P Advise the patient to avoid foods high in sodium, such as canned or commercially prepared foods and dairy products, to curb fluid overload. Encourage participation in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Explain to the patient that the potassium he loses through diuretic therapy may need to be replaced by taking a prescribed potassium supplement and eating highpotassium foods, such as bananas and apricots. Stress the need for regular checkups. Stress the importance of taking digoxin exactly as prescribed. Tell the patient to watch for and immediately report signs of toxicity, such as anorexia, vomiting, and yellow vision. Tell the patient to notify the practitioner promptly if his pulse is unusually irregular or measures less than 60 beats/minute; if he experiences dizziness, blurred vision, shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough, palpitations, increased fatigue, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, swollen ankles, or decreased urine output; or if he notices rapid weight gain (3 to 5 lb [1.4 to 2.3 kg] in 1 week). PREVENTION Instruct patient to make lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, stress reduction, and reduced sodium, alcohol, and fat intake. Instruct patient to practice compliance with and timely administration of maintenance doses of diuretics and cardiac drugs.\", 'In the patient with acute failure: Monitor for signs of progressive failure (increasing crackles and dyspnea and increased jugular vein distention) and compromised renal perfusion (oliguria, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances). Weigh the patient daily. If the patient is receiving vasodilators, check blood pressure and heart rate. If he becomes hypotensive, stop the\\ninfusion and place him in a supine position, with legs elevated to increase venous return and to ensure cerebral blood flow. If the patient is receiving diuretics, monitor for signs of resolving congestion (decreased crackles and dyspnea) or too vigorous diuresis. Check serum potassium level for hypokalemia, especially if therapy includes digoxin. Therapeutic restrictions and an uncertain prognosis usually cause profound anxiety and depression, so offer support and let the patient express his feelings. Be flexible with visiting hours. Before discharge, teach the patient about his illness and its treatment. Emphasize the need to avoid alcohol, smoking, to restrict sodium intake, to watch for weight gain (a weight gain of 3 lb [1.4 kg] over 1 to 2 days indicates fluid accumulation), and to take digoxin as prescribed, and watch for its adverse effects (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and yellow vision). Encourage family members to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation.', \"Because syncope or sudden death may follow\\nwell-tolerated exercise, warn such patients against strenuous physical activity such as running. Administer medications as prescribed. Caution: Avoid nitroglycerin, digoxin, and diuretics because they can worsen obstruction. Warn the patient not to stop taking propranolol abruptly, because doing so may increase myocardial demands. To determine the patient's tolerance for an increased P dosage of propranolol, take his pulse to check for bradycardia. Also take his blood pressure while he's supine and standing (a drop in blood pressure [more than 10 mm Hg] when standing may indicate orthostatic hypotension). Before dental work or surgery, tell the patient to discuss prophylaxis for subacute infective endocarditis with his health care provider. Provide psychological support. If the patient is hospitalized for a long time, be flexible with visiting hours\\nand encourage occasional weekends away from the hospital, if possible. Refer the patient for psychosocial counseling to help him and his family\\naccept his restricted lifestyle and poor prognosis. If the patient is a child, have his parents arrange for him to continue his studies in the health care facility. Because sudden cardiac arrest is possible, urge the patient's family to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS\", \"Management of hypovolemic shock necessitates prompt, aggressive supportive measures and careful assessment and monitoring of vital signs. Follow these priorities: Check for a patent airway and adequate circulation. If blood pressure and heart rate are absent, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Record blood pressure, pulse rate, peripheral pulses, respiratory rate, and other vital signs every 15 minutes and the electrocardiograph continuously. Systolic blood pressure\\nlower than 80 mm Hg usually results in inadequate coronary artery blood\\nflow, cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, and further complications of low cardiac output. When blood pressure drops below 80 mm Hg, increase the oxygen flow rate and notify the practitioner immediately. A progressive drop in blood pressure, accompanied by a thready pulse, generally signals inadequate cardiac output from reduced intravascular volume. Notify the practitioner and increase the infusion rate. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK In hypovolemic shock, vascular fluid volume loss causes extreme tissue hypoperfusion. Internal fluid losses can result from hemorrhage or third space fluid shifting. External fluid loss can result\\nfrom severe bleeding or from severe diarrhea, diuresis, or vomiting. Inadequate vascular volume leads to decreased venous return and cardiac output. The resulting drop in arterial blood pressure activates the body's compensatory mechanisms in an attempt to increase vascular volume. If compensation is unsuccessful, decompensation and death may occur. P Start I.V. lines with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, using a large-bore catheter (14 G), which allows easier administration of later blood transfusions. ( Caution: Don't start I.V. lines in the legs of a patient in shock who has suffered abdominal trauma, because infused fluid may escape through the ruptured vessel into the abdomen.) An indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted to measure hourly urine output. If output is less than 30 ml/hour in adults, increase the fluid infusion rate, but watch for signs\\nof fluid overload such as an increase in pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP). Notify the practitioner if urine output doesn't improve. An osmotic diuretic such as mannitol may be ordered to increase\\nrenal blood flow and urine output. Determine how much fluid to give by checking blood pressure, urine output, central venous pressure (CVP), or PAWP. (To increase accuracy, CVP should be measured at the level of the right atrium, using the same reference point on the chest each time.) USING A PNEUMATIC ANTISHOCK GARMENT A pneumatic antishock garment counteracts bleeding and hypovolemia by slowing or stopping arterial bleeding; by forcing any available blood from the lower body to the heart, brain, and other vital\\norgans; and by preventing return of the available circulating blood volume to the legs. Do While the patient is wearing a pneumatic antishock garment, monitor blood pressure, apical and radial pulse rates, and respirations; check extremities for pedal pulses, color, warmth, and numbness; and make sure the garment isn't too constricting. Remove the garment only when a physician is present, fluids are available for transfusion, and anesthesia and surgical teams are available. The compartments are deflated slowly and only one section at a time while the patient is monitored closely. To clean, wash with warm soap and water, air-dry, and store. Don't Don't apply the garment if positions or wounds show or suggest major intrathoracic or intracranial vascular injury or if the patient has open extremity bleeding, pulmonary edema, or trauma above the application site. It may be used during pregnancy; however, the abdominal compartment should not be inflated. When cleaning, don't autoclave or use solvents. Draw an arterial blood sample to measure blood gas levels. Administer oxygen by face mask or airway to ensure adequate oxygenation of tissues. Adjust the oxygen flow rate to a higher\\nor lower level, as blood gas measurements indicate. Draw venous blood for complete blood count and electrolyte, type and crossmatch, and coagulation studies. During therapy, assess skin color and temperature, and note changes. Cold, clammy skin may be a sign of continuing peripheral vascular constriction, indicating progressive shock. Watch for signs of impending coagulopathy (petechiae, bruising, and bleeding P or oozing from gums or venipuncture sites). Explain procedures and their purpose. Throughout these emergency measures, provide emotional support to the patient and his family. PREVENTION Recognize patients with conditions that reduce blood volume as at-risk patients. Estimate fluid loss and replace, as necessary, to prevent hypovolemic shock.\", \"At the first sign of cardiogenic shock, check the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. If the patient is hypotensive or is having difficulty breathing, ensure a patent I.V. line\\nand a patent airway, and provide oxygen to promote tissue oxygenation. Notify the practitioner immediately. Monitor ABG values to measure oxygenation and detect acidosis from poor tissue perfusion. Increase oxygen delivery\\nas indicated. Check complete blood count and electrolyte levels. After diagnosis, monitor cardiac rhythm continuously and assess skin color, temperature, and other vital signs often. Watch for a drop in systolic blood pressure to less than 80 mm Hg\\n(usually compromising cardiac output further). Report hypotension immediately. An indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted to measure urine output. Notify the practitioner if output drops below 30 ml/ hour. Using a pulmonary artery catheter, closely\\nmonitor PAP, PAWP and, if equipment is available, cardiac output. A high PAWP indicates heart failure and should be reported. When a patient is on the IABP, reposition him often and perform passive range-of-motion exercises to prevent skin breakdown. However, don't flex the patient's “ballooned” leg at the hip because this may displace or fracture the catheter. Assess pedal pulses and skin temperature and color to make sure circulation to the leg is adequate. Check the dressing on the insertion site frequently for bleeding and change it according to facility protocol. Also, check the site for hematoma or signs of infection, and culture any drainage. After the patient becomes hemodynamically stable, the frequency of balloon inflation is gradually reduced to wean him from the IABP. During weaning, carefully watch for monitor changes, chest pain, and other signs of recurring cardiac ischemia and shock. Provide psychological support and reassurance because the patient and his family may be anxious about the intensive care unit, IABP, and other tubes and devices. To ease emotional stress, plan your care to allow frequent rest periods, and provide as much privacy as possible. UNDERSTANDING THE IABP An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) consists of a polyurethane balloon attached to an external pump console by means of a large-lumen catheter. It's inserted percutaneously through the femoral artery and positioned in the descending aorta, just distal to the left subclavian artery and above the renal arteries. Push… This external pump works in precise counterpoint to the left ventricle, inflating the balloon with helium early in diastole and deflating it just before systole. As the balloon inflates, it forces blood toward the aortic valve, thereby raising pressure in the aortic root and augmenting diastolic pressure to improve coronary perfusion. It\\nalso improves peripheral circulation by forcing blood through the brachiocephalic, common carotid, and subclavian arteries arising from the aortic trunk. …and pull The balloon deflates rapidly at the end of diastole, creating a vacuum in the aorta. This reduces aortic volume and pressure,\\nthereby decreasing the resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload). This decreased workload, in turn, reduces the heart's oxygen requirements and, combined with the improved myocardial perfusion, helps prevent or diminish myocardial ischemia. PREVENTION Emphasize the fact that prevention requires timely, thorough, and aggressive identification and treatment of causative disorders. P\", 'If ventricular tachycardia occurs, administer a prescribed antiarrhythmic such as lidocaine. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate. If cardiac arrest develops, initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and call for assistance, resuscitative equipment, and medication. In a patient with heart failure, closely monitor vital signs, heart sounds, intake and output, fluid and electrolyte balances, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Because of the threat of systemic embolization, frequently check peripheral pulses and the color and temperature of extremities. Be alert for sudden changes in sensorium that indicate cerebral embolization and for any signs that suggest renal failure or progressive MI. If arrhythmias necessitate cardioversion, use a sufficient amount of conducting jelly to prevent chest burns. If the patient is conscious, give diazepam or methohexital I.V., as ordered, before cardioversion. Explain that cardioversion is a lifesaving method using brief electroshock to the heart. If the patient is receiving antiarrhythmics, check appropriate laboratory tests. For instance, if the patient takes procainamide, check antinuclear antibodies because this drug may induce symptoms that mimic lupus erythematosus. If the patient is scheduled to undergo resection: Before surgery, explain expected postoperative care in the intensive care unit (including use of such things as endotracheal tube, ventilator, hemodynamic monitoring, chest tubes, and drainage bottle). After surgery, monitor vital signs, intake\\nand output, heart sounds, and pulmonary artery catheter. Watch for signs of infection, such as fever and drainage. To prepare the patient for discharge: Teach him how to check for pulse irregularity and rate changes. Encourage him to follow his prescribed medication regimen —even during the night—and to watch for adverse effects. Because arrhythmias can cause sudden death, refer the family to a community-based CPR training program. Provide psychological support for the patient and his family.', \"If the patient needs pericardiocentesis: Explain the procedure to him. Keep a pericardial aspiration needle attached to a 50-ml syringe by a three-way\\nstopcock, an ECG machine, and an emergency cart with a defibrillator at\\nthe bedside. Make sure the equipment is turned on and ready for immediate use. Position him at a 45- to 60- degree angle. Connect the precordial ECG lead to the hub of the aspiration needle with an alligator clamp and connecting wire, and assist with fluid aspiration. When the needle touches the myocardium, you'll see an ST-segment elevation or premature ventricular contractions. Monitor blood pressure and CVP during and after pericardiocentesis. Infuse I.V. solutions, as prescribed, to maintain blood pressure. Watch for a decrease in CVP and a concomitant rise in blood pressure, which indicate relief of cardiac compression. Watch for complications of pericardiocentesis, such as ventricular fibrillation, vasovagal response, or coronary artery or cardiac chamber puncture. Closely monitor ECG changes, blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness,\\nand urine output. If the patient needs thoracotomy: Explain the procedure to him. Tell him what to expect postoperatively (chest tubes, drainage bottles, and oxygen administration). Teach him how to turn, deep breathe, and cough. Give antibiotics, protamine sulfate, or vitamin K, as ordered. Postoperatively, monitor critical parameters, such as vital signs and arterial blood gas values, and assess heart and breath sounds. Give pain medication as ordered. Maintain the chest drainage system and be alert for complications, such as hemorrhage and arrhythmias. PREVENTION Instruct patient to practice heart-healthy living, with a heart-healthy diet, stress reduction, regular exercise, and preventive care, maintaining a healthy weight, smoking cessation, and abstinence from alcohol.\", \"Assess an unmonitored patient for rhythm disturbances. If the patient's pulse is abnormally rapid, slow, or irregular, watch for signs of hypoperfusion, such as altered level of consciousness (LOC), hypotension, and diminished urine output. Document arrhythmias in a monitored patient, and assess for possible causes and effects. P When life-threatening arrhythmias develop, rapidly assess LOC, respirations, and pulse rate. Initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation if indicated. Evaluate the patient for altered cardiac output resulting from arrhythmias. Administer medications as ordered and prepare to assist with medical procedures, if indicated (for example, cardioversion). Monitor patient for predisposing factors —such as fluid and electrolyte imbalance —and signs of drug toxicity, especially with digoxin. If you suspect drug toxicity, report such signs\\nto the practitioner immediately and withhold the next dose. To prevent arrhythmias in a postoperative cardiac patient, provide adequate oxygen and reduce the heart's workload\\nwhile carefully maintaining metabolic, neurologic, respiratory, and hemodynamic status. Consider sedation for transcutaneous pacing if appropriate. To avoid temporary pacemaker malfunction, install a fresh battery before each insertion. Carefully secure the external catheter wires and the pacemaker box. Assess the threshold daily. Watch closely for premature contractions, a sign of myocardial irritation. To avert permanent pacemaker malfunction, restrict the patient's activity after insertion as ordered. Monitor the pulse rate regularly and watch for signs of decreased cardiac output. If the patient has a permanent pacemaker, warn him about environmental hazards, as indicated by the pacemaker manufacturer. Although hazards may not present a problem, in doubtful situations, 24-hour Holter monitoring may be helpful. Tell the patient to report light-headedness or syncope and stress the importance of regular checkups. Compare the patient's cardiac status (pulse, blood pressure, and cardiac output) with the cardiac rhythm before and after treatments. NORMAL CARDIAC CONDUCTION Each electrical impulse travels from the sinoatrial node (1) through the intra- atrial tracts (2), producing atrial contraction. The impulse slows momentarily as it passes through the atrioventricular junction (3) to the bundle of His (4). Then, it descends the left and right bundle branches (5) and reaches the Purkinje fibers (6), stimulating ventricular contraction. P P P P P P P PREVENTION Maintain adequate oxygenation. Maintain normal fluid, acid-base, and electrolyte balance (especially potassium, magnesium, and calcium). Maintain normal drug levels. TYPES OF CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS This chart reviews many common cardiac arrhythmias and outlines their features, causes, and treatments. Use a normal electrocardiogram strip, if available, to compare normal cardiac rhythm configurations with the rhythm strips below.

Assess pain, breathing, and carotid, radial, and femoral pulses. Make sure laboratory tests include complete blood count, differential, electrolyte levels, type and crossmatching for whole blood, arterial blood gas studies, and urinalysis. Insert an indwelling urinary catheter. Administer dextrose 5% in water or lactated Ringer's solution, and antibiotics, as ordered. Carefully monitor nitroprusside I.V.; use a separate I.V. line for infusion. Adjust the dose by slowly increasing the infusion rate. Meanwhile, check blood pressure every 5 minutes until\\nit stabilizes. With suspected bleeding from aneurysm, give whole blood transfusion. Explain diagnostic tests. If surgery is scheduled, explain the procedure and expected postoperative care (I.V. lines, ET and drainage tubes, cardiac monitoring, and ventilation). After repair of thoracic aneurysm: Assess level of consciousness. Monitor vital signs; pulmonary artery pressure, PAWP, and CVP; pulse rate; urine\\noutput; and pain. Check respiratory function. Carefully observe and record type and amount of chest-tube drainage, and frequently assess heart and breath sounds. Monitor I.V. therapy. Give medications as appropriate. Watch for signs of infection, especially fever, and excessive wound drainage. Assist with range-of-motion exercises of legs to prevent thromboembolic phenomenon due to venostasis during prolonged bed rest. After stabilization of vital signs and respiration, encourage and assist the patient in turning, coughing, and deep breathing. If necessary, provide intermittent positive-pressure breathing to promote lung expansion. Help the patient walk as soon as he's able. Before discharge, ensure compliance with antihypertensive therapy by explaining the need for such drugs and the expected adverse effects. Teach the patient how to monitor his blood pressure. Refer P P him to community agencies for continued support and assistance, as needed. Throughout hospitalization, offer the patient and his family psychological support. Answer all of their questions honestly and provide reassurance. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THORACIC DISSECTION Ascending aorta Descending aorta Transverse aorta Character of pain Severe,\\nboring, ripping, extending to neck, shoulders, lower back, or abdomen (rarely to jaw and arms); more severe on right side Sudden onset, sharp, tearing, usually between the shoulder blades; may radiate to the chest; most diagnostic feature Sudden onset, sharp, boring, tearing, radiates to shoulders Other symptoms and effects If\\ndissection involves carotids, abrupt onset of neurologic deficit (usually intermittent); bradycardia, aortic insufficiency, and hemopericardium detected by pericardial friction rub; unequal intensity of right and left carotid pulses and radial pulses; difference in blood pressure, especially systolic, between right and left arms Aortic\\ninsufficiency without murmur, hemopericardium, or pleural friction rub;\\ncarotid and radial pulses and blood pressure in both arms tend to stay equal Hoarseness, dyspnea, pain, dysphagia, and dry cough resulting from compression of surrounding structures Diagnostic features Chest X-ray Best diagnostic tool; shows widening of mediastinum, enlargement of ascending aorta Shows widening of mediastinum, descending aorta larger than ascending Shows widening of mediastinum, descending aorta larger than ascending, widened transverse arch Aortography Shows false lumen; narrowing of lumen of aorta in ascending section Shows false lumen; narrowing of lumen of aorta in descending section Shows false lumen, narrowing of lumen of aorta in transverse arch Treatment This is a medical emergency requiring immediate, aggressive treatment to reduce blood pressure (usually with nitroprusside or trimethaphan). Surgical repair is also required. Surgical repair\\nis required but less urgent than for the ascending dissection. Nitroprusside and propranolol may be used to control hypertension if bradycardia and heart failure are absent. Immediate surgical repair (mortality as high as 50%) and control of hypertension are required.\", \"Abdominal aneurysm requires meticulous preoperative and postoperative care, psychological support, and comprehensive patient teaching. Following diagnosis, if rupture isn't imminent, elective surgery allows time for additional preoperative tests to evaluate the patient's clinical status. Monitor vital signs, and type and crossmatch blood. Use only gentle abdominal palpation. As ordered, obtain renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte levels), blood samples\\n(complete blood count with differential), electrocardiogram and cardiac\\nevaluation, baseline pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. Be alert for signs of rupture, which may be immediately fatal. Watch closely for signs of acute blood loss (decreasing blood pressure; increasing pulse and respiratory rate; cool,\\nclammy skin; restlessness; and decreased sensorium). If rupture does occur, the first priority is to get the patient to surgery immediately. A pneumatic antishock garment may be used while transporting him to surgery. Surgery allows direct compression of the aorta to control hemorrhage. Large amounts of blood may be needed during the resuscitative period to replace blood loss. In such a patient, renal failure caused by ischemia is a major postoperative complication, possibly requiring hemodialysis. Before elective surgery, weigh the patient, insert an indwelling urinary catheter and an I.V. line, and assist with insertion of an arterial line and pulmonary artery catheter to monitor fluid and hemodynamic balance. Give prophylactic antibiotics as ordered. Explain the surgical procedure and the expected postoperative care in the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery (I.V. lines, endotracheal [ET] and nasogastric [NG] intubation, and mechanical ventilation). After surgery, in the ICU, closely monitor\\nvital signs, intake and hourly output, neurologic status (level of consciousness, pupil size, and sensation in arms and legs), and ABG values. Assess the depth, rate, and character of respirations and breath\\nsounds at least every hour. P Watch for signs of bleeding (increased pulse and respiratory rates and hypotension) and back pain, which may indicate the graft is tearing. Check abdominal dressings for excessive bleeding or drainage. Be alert for temperature elevations and other signs of infection. After NG intubation for intestinal decompression, irrigate the tube frequently to ensure patency. Record the amount and type of drainage. Suction the ET tube often. If the patient can breathe unassisted and has good breath sounds and adequate ABG values, tidal volume, and vital capacity 24 hours after surgery, he will\\nbe extubated and will require oxygen by mask. Weigh the patient daily to evaluate fluid balance. Help the patient walk as soon as he's able (generally the second day after surgery). Provide psychological support for the patient and his family. Help ease their fears about the ICU, the threat of impending rupture, and surgery by providing appropriate explanations and answering all questions. ABDOMINAL ANEURYSMS: BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY During surgery, a prosthetic graft replaces or encloses the weakened area. Before surgery After surgery Aneurysm below renal arteries and above bifurcation The prosthesis extends distal to the renal arteries to above the aortic bifurcation. Before surgery After surgery Aneurysm below renal arteries involving the iliac branches The prosthesis extends to the common femoral arteries. Before surgery After surgery P P Small aneurysm in a patient with poor distal runoff (poor risk) The external prosthesis encircles the aneurysm and is held in place with sutures.\", \"Before corrective surgery: P Assess and record circulatory status, noting the location and quality of peripheral pulses in the affected arm or leg. Administer prophylactic antibiotics or anticoagulants, as ordered. Discuss postoperative procedures and review the explanation of the surgery. After arterial surgery: Monitor carefully for early signs of thrombosis or graft occlusion (loss of pulse, decreased skin temperature\\nand sensation, and severe pain) and infection (fever). Palpate distal pulses at least every hour for the first 24 hours and then as frequently as ordered. Correlate these findings with preoperative circulatory assessment. Mark the sites on the patient's skin where pulses are palpable to facilitate repeated checks. Help the patient walk soon after surgery to prevent venostasis and possible thrombus formation. To prepare the patient for discharge: Tell the patient to immediately report any\\nrecurrence of symptoms because the saphenous vein graft replacement can\\nfail or another aneurysm may develop. Explain to the patient with popliteal artery resection that swelling may persist for some time. If antiembolism stockings are ordered, make sure they fit properly and teach the patient how to apply them. Warn against wearing constrictive apparel. If the patient is receiving anticoagulants, suggest measures to prevent bleeding such as using an electric razor. Tell him to report any signs of bleeding immediately (bleeding gums, tarry stools, and easy bruising). Explain the importance\\nof follow-up blood studies to monitor anticoagulant therapy. Warn him to avoid trauma, tobacco, and aspirin.\", \"Patient teaching, identification of high-risk patients, and measures to prevent venostasis can prevent DVT; close monitoring of anticoagulant therapy can prevent serious complications such as internal hemorrhage. Enforce bed rest as ordered, and elevate the patient's affected arm or leg. If you plan to use pillows for elevating the leg, place them so they support the entire length of the affected extremity to prevent possible compression of the popliteal space. Apply warm soaks to increase circulation to the affected area and to relieve pain and inflammation. Give analgesics to relieve pain, as ordered. Measure and record the affected arm or leg's circumference daily and compare this measurement to the other arm or leg. To ensure accuracy and consistency of serial measurements, mark the skin over the area and measure at the same spot daily. Administer heparin I.V., as ordered, with an infusion monitor or pump to control the flow rate if necessary. Measure partial thromboplastin time regularly for the patient on heparin therapy; prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) for the patient on warfarin (therapeutic anticoagulation values are 1½ to 2 times control values for\\nprothrombin time and an INR of 2 to 3). Watch for signs and symptoms of\\nbleeding, such as dark, tarry stools; coffee-ground vomitus; and ecchymoses. Encourage the patient to use an electric razor and to avoid medications that contain aspirin. Be alert for signs of pulmonary emboli (crackles, dyspnea, hemoptysis, sudden changes in mental status, restlessness, and hypotension). To prepare the patient with thrombophlebitis for discharge: Emphasize the importance of follow-up blood studies to monitor anticoagulant therapy. If the patient is being discharged on heparin therapy, teach him or his family how to give subcutaneous injections. If he requires further assistance, arrange for a home health\\nnurse. Tell the patient to avoid prolonged sitting or standing to help prevent recurrence. Teach the patient how to properly apply and use antiembolism stockings. Tell him to report any complications such as cold, blue toes. (See Preventing thrombophlebitis .)\", \"Warn the patient against exposure to the cold. Tell him to wear mittens or gloves in cold weather or when handling cold items or defrosting the freezer. Advise the patient to avoid stressful situations and to stop smoking. P Instruct the patient to inspect the skin frequently and to seek immediate care for signs of skin breakdown or infection. Teach the patient about drugs, their use, and their adverse effects. Provide psychological support and reassurance to allay the patient's fear of amputation and disfigurement.\", \"Strongly urge the patient to stop smoking to enhance the treatment's effectiveness. Symptoms may disappear if he stops his tobacco use. If necessary, refer him to a self-help group to stop smoking. Warn the patient to avoid precipitating factors, such as emotional stress, exposure to extreme temperatures, and trauma. Teach the patient proper foot care, especially the importance of wearing well-fitting shoes and cotton or wool socks. Show him how to inspect his feet daily for cuts, abrasions, and signs of skin breakdown, such as redness and soreness. Remind him to\\nseek medical attention at once after any trauma. If the patient has ulcers and gangrene, enforce bed rest and use a padded footboard or bed cradle to prevent pressure from bed linens. Protect the feet with soft padding. Wash them gently with a mild soap and tepid water, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry with a soft towel. Provide emotional support. If necessary, refer the patient for psychological counseling to help him cope with restrictions imposed by this chronic disease. If he has undergone amputation, assess rehabilitative needs, especially regarding changes in\\nbody image. Refer him to physical therapists, occupational therapists, and social service agencies, as needed.\", \"P Provide comprehensive patient teaching, including proper foot care. Explain diagnostic tests and procedures. Advise the patient to stop smoking and to follow the prescribed medical regimen. Preoperatively, during an acute episode: Assess the patient's circulatory status by checking for the most distal pulses and by inspecting his skin color and temperature. Provide pain relief as needed. Administer heparin by continuous I.V. drip as ordered. Use an infusion monitor or pump to ensure the proper flow rate. Wrap the patient's affected foot in soft cotton batting and reposition it frequently to prevent pressure on any one area. Strictly avoid elevating or applying heat to the affected leg. Watch for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and monitor intake and output for signs of renal failure (urine output less than 30 ml/hour). If the patient has carotid, innominate, vertebral, or subclavian artery occlusion, monitor him for signs of stroke, such as numbness in an arm or leg and intermittent blindness. Postoperatively: Monitor the patient's vital signs. Continuously assess his circulatory function by inspecting skin color and temperature and by checking for distal pulses. In charting, compare earlier assessments and observations. Watch closely for signs of hemorrhage (tachycardia and hypotension) and check dressings for excessive bleeding. In carotid, innominate, vertebral, or subclavian artery occlusion, assess neurologic status frequently for changes in level of consciousness or muscle strength and pupil size. In mesenteric artery occlusion, connect the nasogastric tube to low intermittent suction. Monitor intake and output (low urine output may indicate damage to renal arteries during surgery). Check bowel sounds for return of peristalsis. Increasing abdominal distention and tenderness may indicate extension of bowel ischemia with resulting gangrene, necessitating further excision, or it may indicate peritonitis. In saddle block occlusion, check distal pulses for adequate circulation. Watch for signs of renal failure and mesenteric artery occlusion (severe abdominal pain), and for cardiac arrhythmias, which may precipitate embolus formation. In iliac artery occlusion, monitor urine output for signs of renal failure from decreased perfusion to the kidneys as a result of surgery. Provide meticulous catheter care. In both femoral and popliteal artery occlusions, assist with early ambulation, but discourage prolonged sitting. After amputation, check the patient's stump carefully for drainage and record its color and amount, and the time. Elevate the stump as ordered, and administer adequate analgesic medication. Because phantom limb pain is common, explain this phenomenon\\nto the patient. When preparing the patient for discharge, instruct him to watch for signs of recurrence (pain, pallor, numbness, paralysis, and absence of pulse) that can result from graft occlusion or occlusion at another site. Warn him against wearing constrictive clothing. Selected references Alspach, J., ed. AACN Core Curriculum for Critical Care Nursing, 6th ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 2006. P : Title:\"], 'Atrial septal defect': ['In an atrial septal defect (ASD), an opening between the left and right atria allows shunting of blood between the chambers. Ostium secundum defect (most common) occurs in the region of the fossa ovalis and, occasionally, extends inferiorly, close to the vena cava; sinus venosus defect occurs in the superior-posterior portion of the atrial septum, sometimes extending into the vena cava, and is almost always associated with abnormal drainage of pulmonary veins into the right atrium; ostium primum defect occurs in the inferior portion of the septum primum and is usually associated with atrioventricular valve abnormalities (cleft mitral valve) and conduction defects. ASD accounts for about 10% of congenital heart defects and appears almost twice as often in females as in males, with a strong familial tendency. Although ASD is usually a benign defect during infancy and childhood, delayed development of symptoms and complications\\nmakes it one of the most common congenital heart defects diagnosed in adults. The prognosis is excellent in asymptomatic patients but poor in those with cyanosis caused by large, untreated defects.'], 'Coarctation of the aorta': ['Coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, usually just below the left subclavian artery, near the site where the ligamentum arteriosum (the remnant of the ductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel) joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Coarctation may occur with aortic valve stenosis (usually of a bicuspid aortic valve) and with severe cases of hypoplasia of the aortic arch, patent ductus arteriosus, and ventricular septal defect. Generally, the prognosis for coarctation\\nof the aorta depends on the severity of associated cardiac anomalies; the prognosis for isolated coarctation is good if corrective surgery is performed before this condition induces severe systemic hypertension or degenerative changes in the aorta.'], 'Patent ductus arteriosus': ['The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the lumen of the ductus remains open after birth. This creates a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery and results in recirculation of arterial blood through the lungs.\\nInitially, PDA may produce no clinical effects, but in time it can precipitate pulmonary vascular disease, causing symptoms to appear by age 40. The prognosis is good if the shunt is small or surgical repair is effective. Otherwise, PDA may advance to intractable heart failure, which may be fatal.'], 'Tetralogy of Fallot': ['Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four cardiac defects: ventricular septal defect (VSD), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary stenosis),\\nright ventricular hypertrophy, and dextroposition of the aorta, with overriding of the VSD. Blood shunts right to left through the VSD, permitting unoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood, resulting in\\ncyanosis. Tetralogy of Fallot sometimes coexists with other congenital heart defects, such as patent ductus arteriosus or atrial septal defect.'], 'Transposition of the great arteries': ['In this congenital heart defect, the great arteries are reversed: the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, producing two noncommunicating circulatory systems (pulmonary and systemic). Transposition accounts for\\nabout 5% of all congenital heart defects and often coexists with other congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), VSD with pulmonary stenosis (PS), atrial septal defect (ASD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). It affects two to three times more males than females.'], 'Myocarditis': ['Myocarditis is focal or diffuse inflammation of the cardiac muscle (myocardium). It may be acute or chronic and can occur at\\nany age. In many cases, myocarditis fails to produce specific cardiovascular symptoms or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and recovery is usually spontaneous, without residual defects. Occasionally,\\nmyocarditis is complicated by heart failure; in rare cases, it leads to cardiomyopathy.'], 'Endocarditis': ['Endocarditis (also known as infective or bacterial endocarditis) is an infection of the endocardium, heart valves, or cardiac prosthesis\\nresulting from bacterial or fungal invasion. This invasion produces vegetative growths on the heart valves, endocardial lining of a heart chamber, or endothelium of a blood vessel that may embolize to the spleen, kidneys, central nervous system, and lungs. In endocarditis, fibrin and platelets aggregate on the valve tissue and engulf circulating bacteria or fungi that flourish and produce friable verrucous vegetations. (See Degenerative changes in endocarditis, page 24.)\\nSuch vegetations may cover the valve surfaces, causing ulceration and necrosis; they may also extend to the chordae tendineae, leading to their rupture and subsequent valvular insufficiency. Untreated endocarditis is usually fatal, but with proper treatment, 70% of patients recover. The prognosis is worst when endocarditis causes severe\\nvalvular damage, leading to insufficiency and heart failure, or when it\\ninvolves a prosthetic valve. DEGENERATIVE CHANGES IN ENDOCARDITIS This illustration shows typical vegetations on the endocardium produced by fibrin and platelet deposits on infection sites.'], 'Pericarditis': ['Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the fibroserous sac that envelops, supports, and protects the heart. It occurs in both acute and chronic forms. Acute pericarditis can be fibrinous or effusive, with purulent serous or hemorrhagic exudate; chronic constrictive pericarditis is characterized by dense fibrous pericardial thickening. The prognosis depends on the underlying cause but is generally good in acute pericarditis, unless constriction occurs.'], 'Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease': ['Acute rheumatic fever is a systemic inflammatory disease of childhood, in many cases recurrent, that follows a group A betahemolytic streptococcal infection. Rheumatic heart disease refers to\\nthe cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever and includes pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, and endocarditis) during the early acute phase and chronic valvular disease later. Long-term antibiotic therapy can minimize the recurrence of rheumatic fever, reducing the risk of permanent cardiac damage and eventual valvular deformity. However, severe pancarditis occasionally produces fatal heart failure during the acute phase. Of the patients who survive this complication, about 20% die within 10 years.'], 'Valvular heart disease': ['In valvular heart disease, three types of mechanical disruption can occur: stenosis, or narrowing, of the valve opening; incomplete closure of the valve; and prolapse of the valve. A combination of these three in the same valve may also occur. They can result from such disorders as endocarditis (most common), congenital defects, and inflammation, and they can lead to heart failure. P P P Valvular heart disease occurs in varying forms, described below. Additional information is provided in Types of valvular heart disease , pages 32 through 35. Mitral insufficiency: In this form, blood from the left ventricle flows back into the left atrium during systole, causing the atrium to enlarge to accommodate the backflow. As a result, the left ventricle also dilates to accommodate the increased volume of blood from the atrium and to compensate for diminishing cardiac output. Ventricular hypertrophy and increased end-diastolic pressure result in increased pulmonary artery pressure, eventually leading to left- and right-sided heart failure.

Consequently, left atrial volume and pressure rise and the chamber dilates. Greater resistance to blood flow causes pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy,\\nand right-sided heart failure. Also, inadequate filling of the left ventricle produces low cardiac output. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP): One or both valve leaflets protrude into the left atrium. MVP is the term used when the anatomic prolapse is accompanied by signs and symptoms unrelated to the P valvular abnormality. Aortic insufficiency: Blood flows back into the left ventricle during diastole, causing fluid overload in the ventricle, which dilates and hypertrophies. The excess volume causes fluid overload in the left atrium and, finally, the pulmonary system. Left-sided heart failure and pulmonary edema eventually result. Aortic stenosis: Increased left ventricular pressure tries to overcome the resistance of the narrowed valvular opening. The added workload increases the demand for oxygen, whereas diminished cardiac output causes poor coronary artery perfusion,\\nischemia of the left ventricle, and left-sided heart failure. Pulmonic insufficiency: Blood ejected into\\nthe pulmonary artery during systole flows back into the right ventricle\\nduring diastole, causing fluid overload in the ventricle, ventricular hypertrophy and, finally, right-sided heart failure. Pulmonic stenosis: Obstructed right ventricular outflow causes right ventricular hypertrophy, eventually resulting in right-sided heart failure. Tricuspid insufficiency: Blood flows back into the right atrium during systole, decreasing blood flow to the lungs\\nand the left side of the heart. Cardiac output also lessens. Fluid overload in the right side of the heart can eventually lead to right-sided heart failure. Tricuspid stenosis: Obstructed blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle causes the right atrium to dilate and hypertrophy. Eventually, this leads to right-sided heart failure and increases pressure in the vena cava.'], 'Hypertension': ['Hypertension, an intermittent or sustained elevation in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, occurs as two major types: essential (idiopathic) hypertension, the most common, and secondary hypertension, which results from renal disease or another identifiable cause. Malignant hypertension is a severe, fulminant form of hypertension common to both types. Hypertension is a major cause of stroke, cardiac disease, and renal failure. The prognosis is good if this disorder is detected early and treatment begins before complications develop. Severely elevated blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) may be fatal. (See What happens in hypertensive crisis. )'], 'Coronary artery disease': ['Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow. The result is the loss of oxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissue because of diminished coronary blood flow. This reduction in blood flow can also lead to coronary syndrome (angina or myocardial infarction).'], 'Myocardial infarction': ['Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack and part of a broader category of disease known as acute coronary syndrome, results from prolonged myocardial ischemia due to reduced blood flow through one of the coronary arteries. In cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States and western Europe, death usually results from the cardiac damage or complications of MI. (See Complications of myocardial infarction. )\\nMortality is high when treatment is delayed, and almost one-half of sudden deaths due to an MI occur before hospitalization, within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. The prognosis improves if vigorous treatment begins immediately.'], 'Heart failure': [\"Heart failure is a syndrome characterized by myocardial dysfunction that leads to impaired pump performance (diminished cardiac output) or to frank heart failure and abnormal circulatory congestion. Congestion of systemic venous circulation may result in peripheral edema\\nor hepatomegaly; congestion of pulmonary circulation may cause pulmonary edema, an acute life- threatening emergency. Pump failure usually occurs in a damaged left ventricle (left-sided heart failure) but may occur in the right ventricle (right-sided heart failure) either as a primary disorder or secondary to left-sided heart failure. Sometimes, leftand right-sided heart failure develop simultaneously. (See What happens in heart failure. ) Although heart failure may be acute (as a direct result of myocardial infarction [MI]), it's generally a chronic disorder associated with sodium and water retention by the kidneys. Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have greatly improved the outlook for patients with heart failure, but the prognosis still depends on the underlying cause and its response to treatment. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY WHAT HAPPENS IN HEART FAILURE Heart failure occurs when cardiac output is inadequate to\\nmeet the body's needs. The pathophysiology of heart failure is shown in\\nthe flow chart below. P\"], 'Dilated cardiomyopathy': [\"Dilated cardiomyopathy results from extensively damaged myocardial muscle fibers. This disorder interferes with myocardial metabolism and grossly dilates all four chambers of the heart, giving the heart a globular appearance and shape. In this disorder, hypertrophy\\nmay be present. Dilated cardiomyopathy leads to intractable heart failure, arrhythmias, and emboli. Because this disease isn't usually diagnosed until it's in the advanced stages, the patient's prognosis is generally poor.\"], 'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy': [\"This primary disease of cardiac muscle, also called idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, is characterized by disproportionate, asymmetrical thickening of the interventricular septum, particularly in the left ventricle's free wall.\\nIn hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac output may be low, normal, or high, depending on whether stenosis is obstructive or nonobstructive. If\\ncardiac output is normal or high, the disorder may go undetected for years; but low cardiac output may lead to potentially fatal heart failure. The disease course varies; some patients progressively deteriorate; others remain stable for years.\"], 'Hypovolemic shock': ['In hypovolemic shock, reduced intravascular blood volume causes circulatory dysfunction and inadequate tissue perfusion. Without sufficient blood or fluid replacement, hypovolemic shock syndrome may lead to irreversible cerebral and renal damage, cardiac arrest and, ultimately, death. Hypovolemic shock requires early recognition of signs\\nand symptoms and prompt, aggressive treatment to improve the prognosis. (See What happens in hypovolemic shock, page 62.)'], 'Cardiogenic shock': ['Sometimes called pump failure, cardiogenic shock is a condition of diminished cardiac output that severely impairs tissue perfusion. It reflects severe left-sided heart failure and occurs as a serious complication in 5% to 10% of all patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Historically, mortality for cardiogenic shock had been 80% to 90%, but recent studies indicate that the rate has dropped to 56% to 67% due to the advent of thrombolytics, improved interventional procedures, and better therapies. Mortality is expected to decline even further.'], 'Ventricular aneurysm': ['A ventricular aneurysm is an outpouching, almost always of the left ventricle, that produces ventricular wall dysfunction in about 20% of patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Ventricular aneurysm may develop within weeks after MI. Untreated ventricular aneurysm can lead to arrhythmias, systemic embolization, or heart failure, and may cause sudden death. Resection improves the prognosis in\\npatients with heart failure or refractory patients who have developed ventricular arrhythmias.'], 'Cardiac tamponade': ['P In cardiac tamponade, a rapid, unchecked rise in intrapericardial pressure impairs diastolic filling of the heart. The rise in pressure usually results from blood or fluid accumulation in the\\npericardial sac. If fluid accumulates rapidly, this condition requires emergency lifesaving measures to prevent death. A slow accumulation and rise in pressure, as in pericardial effusion associated with malignant tumors, may not produce immediate symptoms, because the fibrous wall of the pericardial sac can gradually stretch to accommodate as much as 1 to\\n2 L of fluid.'], 'Cardiac arrhythmias': ['In cardiac arrhythmias (sometimes called cardiac dysrhythmias), abnormal electrical conduction or automaticity changes heart rate and rhythm. (See Normal cardiac conduction, page 72.)\\nArrhythmias vary in severity, from those that are mild, asymptomatic, and require no treatment (such as sinus arrhythmia, in which heart rate increases and decreases with respiration) to catastrophic ventricular fibrillation, which necessitates immediate resuscitation. Arrhythmias are generally classified according to their origin (ventricular or supraventricular). Their effect on cardiac output and blood pressure, partially influenced by the origin site, determines their clinical significance. (See Types of cardiac arrhythmias, pages 73 to 80.)'], 'Thoracic aortic aneurysm': ['Thoracic aortic aneurysm is an abnormal widening of the ascending, transverse, or descending part of the aorta. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta is the most common type and has the highest mortality. Aneurysms may be dissecting, a hemorrhagic separation in the aortic wall, usually within the medial layer; saccular, an outpouching of the arterial wall, with a narrow neck; or fusiform, a spindle-shaped enlargement encompassing the entire aortic circumference. (See Types of aortic aneurysms , page 82.)\\nSome aneurysms progress to serious and, eventually, lethal complications, such as rupture of an untreated thoracic dissecting aneurysm into the pericardium, with resulting tamponade.'], 'Abdominal aneurysm': [\"Abdominal aneurysm, an abnormal dilation in the arterial wall, generally occurs in the aorta between the renal arteries and iliac\\nbranches. Rupture—in which the aneurysm breaks open, resulting in profuse bleeding—is a common complication that occurs in larger aneurysms. Dissection occurs when the artery's lining tears, and blood leaks into the walls.\"], 'Femoral and popliteal aneurysms': ['Femoral and popliteal aneurysms (sometimes called peripheral arterial aneurysms) are the end result of progressive atherosclerotic changes occurring in the walls (medial layer) of these major peripheral arteries. These aneurysmal formations may be fusiform (spindle-shaped) or saccular (pouchlike); the fusiform type is three times more common. They may be singular or multiple segmental lesions, often affecting both legs, and may accompany other arterial aneurysms located in the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries. (See Arteries of the leg. ) This condition occurs most frequently in men older than age 50. The clinical course is usually progressive, eventually ending in\\nthrombosis, embolization, and gangrene. Elective surgery before complications arise greatly improves the prognosis.'], 'Thrombophlebitis': ['An acute condition characterized by inflammation and thrombus formation, thrombophlebitis may occur in deep (intermuscular or\\nintramuscular) or superficial (subcutaneous) veins. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombophlebitis affects small veins, such as the soleal venous sinuses, or large veins, such as the vena cava and the femoral, iliac, and subclavian veins, causing venous insufficiency. (See Chronic venous insufficiency. )\\nThis disorder is typically progressive, leading to pulmonary embolism, a\\npotentially lethal complication. Superficial thrombophlebitis is usually self- limiting and seldom leads to pulmonary embolism. Thrombophlebitis often begins with localized inflammation alone (phlebitis), but such inflammation rapidly provokes thrombus formation. Rarely, venous thrombosis develops without associated inflammation of the vein (phlebothrombosis).'], \"Raynaud's disease\": [\"Raynaud's disease is one of several primary arteriospastic disorders characterized by episodic vasospasm in the small peripheral arteries and arterioles, precipitated by exposure to cold or stress. This condition occurs bilaterally and usually affects the hands or, less often, the feet. Raynaud's disease is most prevalent in females, particularly those between puberty and age 40. It's a benign condition, requiring no specific treatment and causing no serious sequelae. Raynaud's phenomenon, however, a condition commonly associated with several connective tissue disorders—such as scleroderma,\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or polymyositis—has a progressive course, leading to ischemia, gangrene, and amputation. Distinguishing between the two disorders is difficult because some patients who experience mild symptoms of Raynaud's disease for several years may later develop overt connective tissue disease —especially scleroderma. PREVENTION PREVENTING THROMBOPHLEBITIS To prevent thrombophlebitis in a high-risk patient, perform range-of-motion exercise while the patient is on bedrest, use intermittent pneumatic calf massage during lengthy surgical or diagnostic procedures, apply antiembolism stockings postoperatively, and\\nencourage early ambulation. After some types of surgery, especially major abdominal or pelvic operations, prophylactic doses of anticoagulants may reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\"], \"Buerger's disease\": [\"Buerger's disease (sometimes called thromboangiitis obliterans) —an\\ninflammatory, nonatheromatous occlusive condition— causes segmental lesions and subsequent thrombus formation in the small and medium arteries (and sometimes the veins), resulting in decreased blood flow to\\nthe feet and legs. This disorder may produce ulceration and, eventually, gangrene.\"], 'Peripheral artery disease': [\"Peripheral artery disease (PAD), referred to as arterial occlusive disease, is the obstruction or narrowing of the lumen of the aorta and its major\\nbranches, causing an interruption of blood flow, usually to the legs and feet. PAD may affect the carotid, vertebral, innominate, subclavian, mesenteric, and celiac arteries. Occlusions may be acute or chronic and\\ncommonly cause severe ischemia, skin ulceration, and gangrene. The prognosis depends on the occlusion's location, the development of collateral circulation to counteract reduced blood flow and, in acute disease, the time elapsed between occlusion and its removal.\"], 'Professional Guide to Diseases, 9th Edition': [\"Copyright ©2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins > Table of Contents > 2 - Respiratory disorders 2 Respiratory disorders Introduction The respiratory system distributes air to the alveoli, where gas exchange— the addition of oxygen (O 2 ) and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )\\nfrom pulmonary capillary blood—takes place. Certain specialized structures within this system play a vital role in preparing air for use\\nby the body. The nose, for example, contains vestibular hairs that filter the air and an extensive vascular network that warms it. The nose\\nalso contains a layer of goblet cells and a moist mucosal surface; water vapor enters the airstream from this mucosal surface to saturate inspired air as it's warmed in the upper airways. Ciliated mucosa in the\\nposterior portion of the nose and nasopharynx as well as major portions\\nof the tracheobronchial tree propel particles deposited by impaction or\\ngravity to the oropharynx, where the particles are swallowed.\"]}\n"

              "{'Respiratory distress syndrome': 'Although a neonate with RDS may breathe normally at first, he usually develops rapid, shallow respirations within minutes or hours of birth, with intercostal, subcostal, or sternal retractions; nasal flaring; and audible expiratory grunting. This grunting is a natural compensatory mechanism designed to produce positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prevent further alveolar collapse. Severe disease is marked by apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis (from hypoxemia, left-to-right shunting through the foramen ovale, or right-to \\x02left intrapulmonary shunting through atelectatic regions of the lung). Other clinical features include pallor, frothy sputum, and low body temperature as a result of an immature nervous system and the absence of subcutaneous fat.',\n",
              " 'Sudden infant death syndrome': \"Although parents find some victims wedged in crib corners or with blankets wrapped around their heads, autopsies rule out suffocation as the cause of death. Autopsy shows a patent airway, so aspiration of vomitus isn't the cause of death. Typically, SIDS babies don't cry out and show no signs of having been disturbed in their sleep. However, their positions or tangled blankets may suggest movement just before death, perhaps due to terminal spasm. Depending on how long the infant has been dead, a SIDS baby may have a mottled complexion with extreme cyanosis of the lips and fingertips or pooling of blood in the legs and feet that may be mistaken for bruises. Pulse and respirations are absent, and the diaper is wet and full of stool.\",\n",
              " 'Croup': 'The onset of croup usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Clinical features include inspiratory stridor, hoarse or muffled vocal sounds, varying degrees of laryngeal obstruction and respiratory distress, and a characteristic sharp, barking, seal-like cough. These symptoms may last only a few hours or persist for a day or two. As it progresses, croup causes inflammatory edema and, possibly, spasm, which can obstruct the upper airway and severely compromise ventilation. (See How croup affects the upper airway.) Each form of croup has additional characteristics: In laryngotracheobronchitis, the symptoms seem to worsen at night. Inflammation causes edema of the bronchi and bronchioles as well as increasingly difficult expiration that frightens the child. Other characteristic features include fever, diffusely decreased breath sounds, expiratory rhonchi, and scattered crackles. Laryngitis, which results from vocal cord edema, is usually mild and produces no respiratory distress except in infants. Early signs include a sore throat and cough, which, rarely, may progress to marked hoarseness, suprasternal and intercostal retractions, inspiratory stridor, dyspnea, P diminished breath sounds, restlessness and, in later stages, severe dyspnea and exhaustion. Acute spasmodic laryngitis affects a child between ages 1 and 3, particularly one with allergies and a family history of croup. It typically begins with mild to moderate hoarseness and nasal discharge, followed by the characteristic cough and noisy inspiration (that usually awaken the child at night), labored breathing with retractions, rapid pulse, and clammy skin. The child understandably becomes anxious, which may lead to increasing dyspnea and transient cyanosis. These severe symptoms diminish after several hours but reappear in a milder form on the next one or two nights.',\n",
              " 'Epiglottiditis': 'Sometimes preceded by an upper respiratory infection, epiglottiditis may rapidly progress to complete upper airway obstruction within 2 to 5 hours. Laryngeal obstruction results from inflammation and edema of the epiglottis. Accompanying symptoms include high fever, stridor, sore throat, dysphagia, irritability, restlessness, and drooling. To relieve severe respiratory distress, the child with epiglottiditis may hyperextend his neck, sit up, and lean forward with his mouth open, tongue protruding, and nostrils flaring as he tries to breathe. He may develop inspiratory retractions and rhonchi.',\n",
              " 'Acute respiratory distress syndrome': \"ARDS initially produces rapid, shallow breathing and dyspnea within hours to days of the initial injury (sometimes after the patient's condition appears to have stabilized). Hypoxemia develops, causing an increased drive for ventilation. Because of the effort required to expand the stiff lung, intercostal and suprasternal retractions result. Fluid accumulation produces crackles and rhonchi; worsening hypoxemia causes restlessness, apprehension, mental sluggishness, motor dysfunction, and tachycardia (possibly with transient increased arterial blood pressure). Severe ARDS causes overwhelming hypoxemia. If uncorrected, this results in hypotension, decreasing urine output, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and eventually ventricular fibrillation or standstill. ELDER TIP The older patient may appear to do well following an initial episode of ARDS. Symptoms commonly appear 2 to 3 days later.\",\n",
              " 'Acute respiratory failure in COPD': 'In patients who have COPD with ARF, increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch and reduced alveolar ventilation decrease PaO2 (hypoxemia) and increase PaCO2 (hypercapnia). This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2 ) lowers the pH. The resulting hypoxemia and acidemia affect all body organs, especially the CNS and the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Specific symptoms vary with the underlying cause of ARF but may include these systems: Respiratory—Rate may be increased, decreased, or normal depending on the cause; respirations may be shallow, deep, or alternate between the two; and air hunger may occur. Cyanosis may or may not be present, depending on the hemoglobin (Hb) level and arterial oxygenation. Auscultation of the chest may reveal crackles, rhonchi, wheezing, or diminished breath sounds. CNS—When hypoxemia and hypercapnia occur, the patient may show evidence of restlessness, confusion, loss of concentration, irritability, tremulousness, diminished tendon reflexes, and papilledema; he may slip into a coma. Cardiovascular—Tachycardia, with increased cardiac output and mildly elevated blood pressure secondary to adrenal release of catecholamine, occurs early in response to low PaO2 . With myocardial hypoxia, arrhythmias may develop. Pulmonary hypertension, secondary to pulmonary capillary vasoconstriction, may cause increased pressures on the right side of the heart, elevated jugular veins, an enlarged liver, and peripheral edema. Stresses on the heart may precipitate cardiac failure.',\n",
              " 'Pulmonary edema': \"The early symptoms of pulmonary edema reflect interstitial fluid accumulation and diminished lung compliance: dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and coughing. Clinical features include tachycardia, tachypnea, dependent crackles, jugular vein distention, and a diastolic (S3 ) gallop. With severe pulmonary edema, the alveoli and bronchioles may fill with fluid and intensify the early symptoms. Respiration becomes labored and rapid, with more diffuse crackles and coughing that produces frothy, bloody sputum. Tachycardia increases, and arrhythmias may occur. Skin becomes cold, clammy, diaphoretic, and cyanotic. Blood pressure falls and the pulse becomes thready as cardiac output falls. Symptoms of severe heart failure with pulmonary edema may also include signs of hypoxemia, such as anxiety, restlessness, and changes in the patient's level of consciousness.\",\n",
              " 'Cor pulmonale': \"As long as the heart can compensate for the increased pulmonary vascular resistance, clinical features reflect the underlying disorder and occur mostly in the respiratory system. They include chronic productive cough, exertional dyspnea, wheezing respirations, fatigue, and weakness. Progression of cor pulmonale is associated with dyspnea (even at rest) that worsens on exertion, tachypnea, orthopnea, edema, weakness, and right upper quadrant discomfort. Chest examination reveals findings characteristic of the underlying lung disease. Signs of cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure include dependent edema; distended jugular veins; prominent parasternal or epigastric cardiac impulse; hepatojugular reflux; an enlarged, tender liver; ascites; and tachycardia. Decreased cardiac output may cause a weak pulse and hypotension. Chest examination yields various findings, depending on the underlying cause of cor pulmonale. In COPD, auscultation reveals wheezing, rhonchi, and diminished breath sounds. When the disease is secondary to upper airway obstruction or damage to central nervous system respiratory centers, chest findings may be normal, except for a right ventricular lift, gallop rhythm, and loud pulmonic component of S2. Tricuspid insufficiency produces a pansystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border; its intensity increases on inspiration, distinguishing it from a murmur due to mitral valve disease. A right ventricular early murmur that increases on inspiration can be heard at the left sternal border or over the epigastrium. A systolic pulmonic ejection click may also be heard. Alterations in the patient's level of consciousness may occur.\",\n",
              " \"Legionnaires' disease\": \"The multisystem clinical features of Legionnaires' disease follow a predictable sequence, although the onset of the disease may be gradual or sudden. After a 2- to 10-day incubation period, nonspecific, prodromal signs and symptoms appear, including diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, diffuse myalgias and generalized weakness, headache, and recurrent chills. An unremitting fever develops within 12 to 48 hours with a temperature that may reach 105° F (40.6° C). A cough then develops that's nonproductive initially but eventually may produce grayish, nonpurulent, and occasionally blood-streaked sputum. Other characteristic features include nausea, vomiting, disorientation, mental sluggishness, confusion, mild temporary amnesia, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, and fine crackles. Patients who develop pneumonia may also experience hypoxia. Other complications include hypotension, delirium, heart failure, arrhythmias, acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and shock (usually fatal)\",\n",
              " 'Atelectasis': 'Clinical effects vary with the cause of collapse, the degree of hypoxemia, and any underlying disease but generally include some degree of dyspnea. Atelectasis of a small area of the lung may produce only minimal symptoms that subside without specific treatment. However, massive collapse can produce severe dyspnea, anxiety, cyanosis, diaphoresis, peripheral circulatory collapse, tachycardia, and substernal or intercostal retraction. Also, atelectasis may result in compensatory hyperinflation of unaffected areas of the lung, mediastinal shift to the affected side, and elevation of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.',\n",
              " 'Respiratory acidosis': 'Acute respiratory acidosis produces CNS disturbances that reflect changes in the pH of cerebrospinal fluid rather than increased CO2 levels in cerebral circulation. Effects range from restlessness, confusion, and apprehension to somnolence, with a fine or flapping tremor (asterixis), or coma. The patient may complain of headaches as well as exhibit dyspnea and tachypnea with papilledema and depressed reflexes. Unless the patient is P receiving O2 , hypoxemia accompanies respiratory acidosis. This disorder may also cause cardiovascular abnormalities, such as tachycardia, hypertension, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and, in severe acidosis, hypotension with vasodilation (bounding pulses and warm periphery).',\n",

This pattern of breathing is similar to Kussmaul's respirations that characterize diabetic acidosis. Such hyperventilation usually leads to CNS and neuromuscular disturbances, such as light-headedness or dizziness (due to below-normal CO2 levels that decrease cerebral blood flow), agitation, circumoral and peripheral paresthesias, carpopedal spasms, twitching (possibly progressing to tetany), and muscle weakness. Severe respiratory alkalosis may cause cardiac arrhythmias (that may fail to respond to conventional treatment), seizures, or both.\",\n",

Additional signs of tension pneumothorax are weak and rapid pulse, pallor, jugular vein distention, and anxiety. Tracheal deviations may be present with mediastinal shift. Tension pneumothorax produces the most severe respiratory symptoms; a spontaneous pneumothorax that releases only a small amount of air into the pleural space may cause no symptoms. In a nontension pneumothorax, the severity of symptoms is usually related to the size of the pneumothorax and the degree of preexisting respiratory disease.',\n",

His ability to exercise or do strenuous work gradually starts to decline, and he begins to develop a productive cough. These signs are subtle at first but become more pronounced as the patient gets older and the disease progresses. Eventually the patient may develop dyspnea on minimal exertion, frequent respiratory infections, intermittent or continuous hypoxemia, and grossly abnormal pulmonary function studies.

Most patients have had these symptoms for several months to 2 years before seeking medical help. End-expiratory crackles, especially in the bases of the lungs, are usually heard early in the disease. Bronchial breath sounds appear later, when airway consolidation develops. Rapid, shallow breathing occurs, especially with exertion, and clubbing has been noted in more than 40% of patients. Late in the disease, cyanosis and evidence of pulmonary hypertension (augmented S2 and S3 gallop) commonly occur.

Progression to the advanced stage causes dyspnea on minimal exertion, worsening cough, and pulmonary hypertension, which in turn leads to right \\x02sided heart failure and cor pulmonale. Patients with silicosis have a high incidence of active TB, which should be considered when evaluating patients with this disease. Central nervous system changes—confusion, lethargy, and a decrease in the rate and depth of respiration as the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide increases—also occur in advanced silicosis. Other clinical features include malaise, disturbed sleep, and hoarseness. The severity of these symptoms may not correlate with chest X-ray findings or the results of pulmonary function tests.\",\n",

              " 'Cerebral palsy': 'Spastic cerebral palsy is characterized by hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, increased stretch reflexes, rapid alternating muscle contraction and relaxation, muscle weakness, underdevelopment of affected limbs, muscle contraction in response to manipulation, and a tendency to contractures. Typically, a child with spastic CP walks on his toes with a scissors gait, crossing one foot in front of the other. In athetoid cerebral palsy, involuntary movements—grimacing, wormlike writhing, dystonia, and sharp jerks—impair voluntary movement. Usually, these involuntary movements affect the arms more severely than the legs; involuntary facial movements may make speech difficult. These athetoid movements become more severe during stress, decrease with relaxation, and disappear entirely during sleep. Ataxic cerebral palsy is characterized by disturbed balance, incoordination (especially of the arms), hypoactive reflexes, nystagmus, muscle weakness, tremor, lack of leg movement during infancy, and a widebased gait as the child begins to walk. Ataxia makes sudden or fine movements almost impossible. Some children with CP display a combination of these clinical features. In most, impaired motor function makes eating (especially swallowing) difficult and retards growth and development. Up to 40% of these children are mentally retarded, about 25% have seizure disorders, and about 80% have impaired speech. Many also have dental abnormalities, vision and hearing defects, and reading disabilities.',\n",
              " 'Hydrocephalus': \"In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing head circumference, clearly disproportionate to the infant's growth. Other characteristic changes include widening and bulging of the fontanels; distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; and underdeveloped neck muscles. (See Signs of hydrocephalus.) In severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbit is depressed, the eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae are prominent. Sclera seen above the iris is called the “setting-sun sign.” A high-pitched, shrill cry, abnormal muscle tone of the legs, irritability, anorexia, and projectile vomiting commonly occur. In adults and older children, indicators of hydrocephalus include decreased level of consciousness (LOC), ataxia, incontinence, loss of coordination, and impaired intellect.\",\n",
              " 'Cerebral aneurysm': \"Occasionally, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes premonitory symptoms that last several days, such as headache, nuchal rigidity, stiff back and legs, and intermittent nausea. Usually, however, onset is abrupt and without warning, causing a sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting and, depending on the severity and location of bleeding, altered consciousness (including deep coma). Bleeding causes meningeal irritation, resulting in nuchal rigidity, back and leg pain, fever, restlessness, irritability, occasional seizures, and blurred vision. Bleeding into the brain tissues causes hemiparesis, hemisensory defects, dysphagia, and visual defects. If the aneurysm is near the internal carotid artery, it compresses the oculomotor nerve and causes diplopia, ptosis, dilated pupil, and inability to rotate the eye. The severity of symptoms varies considerably from patient to patient, depending on the site and amount of bleeding. To better describe their conditions, patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms are grouped as follows: Grade I (minimal bleed): Patient is alert with no neurologic deficit; he may have a slight headache and nuchal rigidity. Grade II (mild bleed): Patient is alert, with a mild to severe headache, nuchal rigidity and, possibly, third-nerve palsy. Grade III (moderate bleed): Patient is confused or drowsy, with nuchal rigidity and, possibly, a mild focal deficit. Grade IV (severe bleed): Patient is stuporous, with nuchal rigidity and, possibly, mild to severe hemiparesis. Grade V (moribund; commonly fatal): If nonfatal, patient is in deep coma or decerebrate. Generally, cerebral aneurysm poses three major threats: Death from increased ICP: Increased ICP may push the brain downward, impair brain stem function, and cut off blood supply to the part of the brain that supports vital functions. Rebleed: Generally, after the initial bleeding episode, a clot forms and seals the rupture, which reinforces the wall of the aneurysm for 7 to 10 days. However, after the 7th day, fibrinolysis begins to dissolve the clot and increases the risk of rebleeding. Signs and symptoms are similar to those accompanying the initial hemorrhage. Rebleeds during the first 24 hours after initial hemorrhage aren't uncommon, and they contribute to cerebral aneurysm's high mortality. Vasospasm: Why this occurs isn't clearly understood. Usually, vasospasm occurs in blood vessels adjacent to the cerebral aneurysm, but it may extend to major vessels of the brain, causing ischemia and altered brain function. Other complications of cerebral aneurysm include pulmonary embolism (a possible adverse effect of deep vein thrombosis or aneurysm treatment) and acute hydrocephalus, occurring as CSF accumulates in the cranial cavity because of blockage by blood or adhesions.\",\n",
              " 'Arteriovenous malformations': 'An AVM may be asymptomatic until complications occur; these may include rupture and a resulting sudden bleed in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Arteriovenous malformations vary in size and location within the brain. Systolic bruit may be auscultated over the carotid artery, mastoid process, or orbit on examination. Symptoms that occur prior to an AVM rupture are related to smaller and slower bleeding from the abnormal vessels, which are usually fragile because their structure is abnormal. In more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage from the malformation is the first symptom. Depending on the location and the severity of the bleed, the hemorrhage can be profoundly disabling or fatal. The risk of bleeding from an AVM is approximately 2% to 4% per year. The first symptoms often include headache, seizure, or other sudden neurological problems, such as vision problems, weakness, inability to move a limb or a side of the body, lack of sensation in part of the body, or abnormal sensations, such as ringing and numbness. Symptoms are the same as for stroke. The individual with an AVM may complain of chronic mild headache, a sudden and severe headache, or a localized or general headache. The headache may resemble migraine and vomiting may occur. Seizures may result from focal neurologic  deficits (depending on the location of the AVM) resulting from compression and diminished perfusion. Symptoms of intracranial (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural) hemorrhage result. Muscle weakness and decreased sensation can occur in any part of the body. Mental status change can occur where the individual appears sleepy, stuporous, lethargic, confused, disoriented, or irritable. Additional symptoms may include stiff neck, speech or sense of smell impairment, dysfunctional movement, fainting, facial paralysis, eyelid drooping, tinnitus, dizziness, and decreased level of consciousness (LOC). If an AVM bleeds once, the risk is greater that it will bleed again in the future. Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages are the most common first symptoms of cerebral arteriovenous malformation. In some cases, symptoms may also occur due to lack of blood flow to an area of the brain (ischemia), compression or distortion of brain tissue by large AVMs, or abnormal brain development in the area of the malformation. Progressive loss of nerve cells in the brain may occur, caused by mechanical (pressure) and ischemic (lack of blood supply) factors.',\n",
              " 'Headache': \"Initially, migraine headaches usually produce unilateral, pulsating pain, which later becomes more generalized. They're commonly preceded by a scintillating scotoma, hemianopsia, unilateral paresthesia, or speech disorders. The patient may experience irritability, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. (See Clinical features of migraine headaches.) Both muscle contraction and tractioninflammatory vascular headaches produce a dull, persistent ache, tender spots on the head and neck, and a feeling of tightness around the head, with a characteristic “hatband” distribution. The pain is usually severe and unrelenting. If caused by intracranial bleeding, these headaches may result in neurologic deficits, such as paresthesia and muscle weakness; narcotics may fail to relieve pain in these cases. If caused by a tumor, pain is most severe when the patient awakens.\",\n",
              " 'Seizure disorder': \"The hallmarks of seizure disorder are recurring seizures, which can be classified as partial or generalized (some patients may be affected by more than one type). Partial seizures arise from a localized area of the brain, causing specific symptoms. In some patients, partial seizure activity may spread to the entire brain, causing a generalized seizure. Partial seizures include simple partial (jacksonian) and complex partial seizures (psychomotor or temporal lobe). A simple partial motor-type seizure begins as a localized motor seizure characterized by a spread of abnormal activity to adjacent areas of the brain. It typically produces stiffening or jerking in one extremity, accompanied by a tingling sensation in the same area. For example, it may start in the thumb and spread to the entire hand and arm. The patient seldom loses consciousness, although the seizure may progress to a generalized seizure. A simple partial sensory-type seizure involves perceptual distortion, which can include hallucinations. The symptoms of a complex partial seizure vary but usually include purposeless behavior. The patient experiences an aura immediately before the seizure. An aura represents the beginning of abnormal electrical discharges within a focal area of the brain and may include a pungent smell, GI distress (nausea or indigestion), a rising or sinking feeling in the stomach, a dreamy feeling, an unusual taste, or a visual disturbance. Overt signs of a complex partial seizure include a glassy stare, picking at one's clothes, aimless wandering, lipsmacking or chewing motions, and unintelligible speech; these signs may last for just a few seconds or as long as 20 minutes. Mental confusion may last several minutes after the seizure; as a result, an observer may mistakenly suspect intoxication with alcohol or drugs or psychosis. Generalized seizures, as the term suggests, cause a generalized electrical abnormality within the brain and include several distinct types: Absence (petit mal) seizures occur most commonly in children, although they may affect adults as well. They usually begin with a brief change in level of consciousness, indicated by blinking or rolling of the eyes, a blank stare, and slight mouth movements. There's little or no tonic-clonic movement. The patient retains his posture and continues preseizure activity without difficulty. Typically, each seizure lasts from 1 to 10 seconds. If not properly treated, seizures can recur as often as 100 times per day. An absence seizure may progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A myoclonic (bilateral massive epileptic myoclonus) seizure is characterized by brief, involuntary muscular jerks of the body or extremities, which may occur in a rhythmic fashion and may precede generalized tonic-clonic seizures by months or years. A generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure typically begins with a loud cry, precipitated by air rushing from the lungs through the vocal cords. The patient then falls to the ground, losing consciousness. The body stiffens (tonic phase) and then alternates between episodes of muscular spasm and relaxation (clonic phase). Tongue-biting, incontinence, labored breathing, apnea, and subsequent cyanosis may also occur. The seizure stops in 2 to 5 minutes, when abnormal electrical conduction of the neurons is completed. The patient then regains consciousness but is somewhat confused and may have difficulty talking. If he can talk, he may complain of drowsiness, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, and arm or leg weakness. He may fall into deep sleep after the seizure. These seizures may start as facial seizures and spread to become generalized. An akinetic seizure is characterized by a general loss of postural tone (the patient falls in a flaccid state) and a temporary loss of consciousness. It occurs in young children and is sometimes called a “drop attack” because it causes the child to fall. Status epilepticus is a continuous seizure state that can occur in all seizure types. The most life-threatening example is generalized tonicclonic status epilepticus, a continuous generalized tonic-clonic seizure without intervening return of consciousness. Status epilepticus is accompanied by respiratory distress. It can result from abrupt withdrawal of anticonvulsant medications, hypoxic encephalopathy, acute head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, or septicemia secondary to encephalitis or meningitis.\",\n",
              " 'Stroke': 'Clinical features of stroke vary with the artery affected (and, consequently, the portion of the brain it supplies), the severity of damage, and the extent of collateral circulation that develops to help the brain compensate for decreased blood supply. If the stroke occurs in the left hemisphere, it produces symptoms on the right side; if in the right hemisphere, symptoms are on the left side. However, a stroke that causes cranial nerve damage produces signs of cranial nerve dysfunction on the same side as the hemorrhage. Symptoms are usually classified according to the artery affected: Middle cerebral artery: aphasia, dysphasia, visual field cuts, and hemiparesis on affected side (more severe in the face and arm than in the leg) Carotid artery: weakness, paralysis, numbness, sensory changes, and visual disturbances on affected side; altered level of consciousness (LOC), bruits, headaches, aphasia, and ptosis Vertebrobasilar artery: weakness on affected side, numbness around lips and mouth, visual field cuts, diplopia, poor coordination, dysphagia, slurred speech, dizziness, amnesia, and ataxia Anterior cerebral artery: confusion, weakness, and numbness (especially in the leg) on affected side, incontinence, loss of coordination, impaired motor and sensory functions, and personality changes Posterior cerebral arteries: visual field cuts, sensory impairment, dyslexia, coma, and cortical blindness; typically, paralysis is absent. Symptoms can also be classified as premonitory, generalized, and focal. Premonitory symptoms, such as drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and mental confusion, are rare. Generalized symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, mental impairment, seizures, coma, nuchal rigidity, fever, and disorientation, are typical. Focal symptoms, such as sensory and reflex changes, reflect the site of hemorrhage or infarct and may worsen.',\n",
              " 'Meningitis': \"The cardinal signs of meningitis are infection (fever, chills, and malaise) and increased intracranial pressure (ICP; headache, vomiting and, rarely, papilledema). Signs of positive Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, exaggerated and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, and opisthotonos (a spasm in which the back and extremities arch backward so that the body rests on the head and heels). (See Two signs of meningitis, pages 198 and 199.) Other manifestations of meningitis are irritability; sinus arrhythmias; photophobia, diplopia, and other visual problems; and delirium, deep stupor, and coma. An infant may not show clinical signs of infection but may be fretful and refuse to eat. Such an infant may vomit often, leading to dehydration; this prevents a bulging fontanel and thus masks this important sign of increased ICP. As the illness progresses, twitching, seizures (in 30% of infants), or coma may develop. Most older children have the same symptoms as adults. In subacute meningitis, the onset may be insidious.\",\n",
              " 'Encephalitis': 'All viral forms of encephalitis have similar clinical features, although certain differences do occur. Usually, the acute illness begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting and progresses to include signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation (stiff neck and back) and neuronal damage (drowsiness, coma, paralysis, seizures, ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, and organic psychoses). After the acute phase of the illness, coma may persist for days or weeks. The severity of arbovirus encephalitis may range from subclinical to rapidly fatal necrotizing disease. Herpes encephalitis also produces signs and symptoms that vary from subclinical to acute and commonly fatal fulminating disease. Associated effects include disturbances of taste or smell.',\n",
              " 'Brain abscess': 'Onset varies according to cause, but generally brain abscess produces clinical effects similar to those of a brain tumor. Early symptoms result from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and include constant intractable headache, worsened by straining; nausea; vomiting; and focal or generalized seizures. Typical later symptoms include ocular disturbances, such as nystagmus, decreased vision, and unequal pupil size. Other features differ with the site of the abscess: temporal lobe abscess: auditory-receptive dysphasia, central facial weakness, and hemiparesis cerebellar abscess: dizziness, coarse nystagmus, gaze weakness on lesion side, tremor, and ataxia frontal lobe abscess: expressive dysphasia, hemiparesis with unilateral motor seizure, drowsiness, inattention, and mental function impairment. Signs of infection, such as fever, pallor, and bradycardia, are absent until late stages unless they result from the predisposing condition. If the abscess is encapsulated, they may never appear. Depending on abscess size and location, level of consciousness (LOC) varies from drowsiness to deep stupor.',\n",

The patient eventually becomes totally dependent— emotionally and physically—through loss of musculoskeletal control, and he develops progressively severe choreic movements. Such movements are rapid, usually violent, and purposeless. Initially, they're unilateral and more prominent in the face and arms than in the legs, progressing from mild fidgeting to grimacing, tongue smacking, dysarthria (indistinct speech), athetoid movements (especially of the hands) related to emotional state, and torticollis. Ultimately, the patient with Huntington's disease develops progressive dementia, although the dementia doesn't always progress at the same rate as the chorea. Dementia can be mild at first, but eventually causes severe disruption of the personality. Personality changes include obstinacy, carelessness, untidiness, moodiness, apathy, inappropriate behavior, loss of memory and concentration and, occasionally, paranoia.\",\n",

Muscle rigidity results in resistance to passive muscle stretching, which may be uniform (leadpipe rigidity) or jerky (cogwheel rigidity). Akinesia causes the patient to walk with difficulty (gait lacks normal parallel motion and may be retropulsive or propulsive) and produces a high-pitched, monotone voice; drooling; a masklike facial expression; loss of posture control (the patient walks with body bent forward); and dysarthria, dysphagia, or both. Occasionally, akinesia may also cause oculogyric crises (eyes are fixed upward, with involuntary tonic movements) or blepharospasm (eyelids are completely closed). Parkinson's disease itself doesn't impair the intellect, but a coexisting disorder, such as arteriosclerosis, may do so.\",\n",
              " 'Myelitis and acute transverse myelitis': 'In acute transverse myelitis, onset is rapid, with motor and sensory dysfunctions below the level of spinal cord damage appearing in 1 to 2 days. Patients with acute transverse myelitis develop flaccid paralysis of the legs (sometimes beginning in just one leg) with loss of sensory and sphincter functions. Such sensory loss may follow pain in the legs or trunk. Reflexes disappear in the early stages but may reappear later. The extent of damage depends on the level of the spinal cord affected; transverse myelitis seldom involves the arms. If spinal cord damage is severe, it may cause shock (hypotension and hypothermia).',\n",
              " \"Alzheimer's disease\": \"Onset is insidious. Initially, the patient undergoes almost imperceptible changes, such as forgetfulness, recent memory loss, difficulty learning and remembering new information, deterioration in personal hygiene and appearance, and an inability to concentrate. Gradually, tasks that require abstract thinking and activities that require judgment become more difficult. Progressive difficulty in communication and severe deterioration in memory, language, and motor function result in a loss of coordination and an inability to write or speak. Personality changes (restlessness, irritability) and nocturnal awakenings are common. Patients also exhibit loss of eye contact, a fearful look, wringing of the hands, and other signs of anxiety. When a patient with Alzheimer's disease is overwhelmed with anxiety, he becomes dysfunctional, acutely confused, agitated, compulsive, or fearful. Eventually, the patient becomes disoriented, and emotional lability and physical and intellectual disability progress. The patient becomes susceptible to infection and accidents. Usually, death results from infection.\",\n",

Dementia is progressive and occurs early. Involuntary movements, such as muscle twitching, trembling, and peculiar body movements, and visual disturbances, appear with disease progression and advancing mental deterioration. Hallucinations are also common. Duration of the typical illness is 4 months.',\n",
              " \"Reye's syndrome\": \"The severity of the child's signs and symptoms varies with the degree of encephalopathy and cerebral edema. In any case, Reye's syndrome develops in five stages. After the initial viral infection, a brief recovery period follows when the child doesn't seem seriously ill. A few days later, he develops intractable vomiting; lethargy; rapidly changing mental status (mild to severe agitation, confusion, irritability, and delirium); rising blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate; and hyperactive reflexes. Reye's syndrome commonly progresses to coma. As coma deepens, seizures develop, followed by decreased tendon reflexes and, usually, respiratory failure. Increased ICP, a serious complication, is now considered the result of an increased cerebral blood volume causing intracranial hypertension. Such swelling may develop as a result of acidosis, increased cerebral metabolic rate, and an impaired autoregulatory mechanism.\",\n",
              " 'Guillain-Barré syndrome': \"About 50% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome have a history of minor febrile illness (10 to 14 days before onset), usually an upper respiratory tract infection or, less commonly, gastroenteritis with Camphylobacter jejuni. When infection precedes onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome, signs of infection subside before neurologic features appear. Other possible precipitating factors include surgery, rabies or swine influenza vaccination, viral illness like Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and HIV, Hodgkin's or other malignant disease, and lupus erythematosus. Symmetrical muscle weakness, the major neurologic sign, usually appears in the legs first (ascending type) and then extends to the arms and facial nerves in 24 to 72 hours. Sometimes, muscle weakness develops in the arms first (descending type) or in the arms and legs simultaneously. (See Testing for thoracic sensation.) In milder forms of this disease, muscle weakness may affect only the cranial nerves or may not occur at all. Another common neurologic sign is paresthesia, which sometimes precedes muscle weakness but tends to vanish quickly. However, some patients with this disorder never develop this symptom. Other clinical features may include facial diplegia (possibly with ophthalmoplegia), dysphagia or dysarthria and, less commonly, weakness of the muscles supplied by cranial nerve XI. Muscle weakness develops so quickly that muscle atrophy doesn't occur, but hypotonia and areflexia do. Stiffness and pain in the form of a severe “charley horse” commonly occur.\",\n",
              " 'Myasthenia gravis': 'The dominant symptoms of myasthenia gravis are skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. In the early stages, easy fatigability of certain muscles may appear with no other findings. Later, it may be severe enough to cause paralysis. Typically, myasthenic muscles are strongest in the morning but weaken throughout the day, especially after exercise. Short rest periods temporarily restore muscle function. Muscle weakness is progressive; more and more muscles become weak, and eventually some muscles may lose function entirely. Resulting symptoms depend on the muscle group affected; they become more intense during menses and after emotional stress, prolonged exposure to sunlight or cold, or infections.',\n",

Mental deterioration doesn't occur, but patients may become depressed as a reaction to the disease.\",\n",
              " 'Multiple sclerosis': 'Clinical findings in MS depend on the extent and site of myelin destruction, the extent of remyelination, and the adequacy of subsequent restored synaptic transmission. Signs and symptoms in MS may be transient, or they may last for hours or weeks. They may wax and wane with no predictable pattern, vary from day to day, and be bizarre and difficult for the patient to describe. In most patients, visual problems and sensory impairment, such as numbness and tingling sensations (paresthesia), are the first signs that something may be wrong. Other characteristic changes include: ocular disturbances—optic neuritis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, blurred vision, and nystagmus muscle dysfunction—weakness, paralysis ranging from monoplegia to quadriplegia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, intention tremor, and gait ataxia urinary disturbances—incontinence, frequency, urgency, and frequent infections emotional lability—characteristic mood swings, irritability, euphoria, and depression. Associated signs and symptoms include poorly articulated or scanning speech and dysphagia. Clinical effects may be so mild that the patient is unaware of them or so bizarre that he appears hysterical.',\n",

On the weak side, the mouth droops (causing the patient to drool saliva from the corner of his mouth), and taste perception is distorted over the affected anterior portion of the tongue. The forehead appears smooth, and the patient's ability to close his eye on the weak side is markedly impaired. When he tries to close this eye, it rolls upward (Bell's phenomenon) and shows excessive tearing. Although Bell's phenomenon occurs in normal people, it isn't apparent because the eyelids close completely and cover this eye motion. In Bell's palsy, incomplete eye closure makes this upward motion obvious. Other symptoms may include loss of taste and ringing in the ear.\",\n",
              " 'Peripheral neuritis': 'The clinical effects of peripheral neuritis develop slowly, and the disease usually affects the motor and sensory nerve fibers. Symptoms vary according to which type of nerve is affected (sensory, motor, or autonomic). Neuropathy can affect any one or be a combination of all three types. Sensory changes: Damage to sensory fibers results in changes in sensation, ranging from abnormal sensations, such as burning, nerve pain, or tingling, to numbness or an inability to determine joint position in the area. Sensation changes often begin in the feet and progress toward the center of the body with involvement of other areas as the condition worsens. Motor changes: Damage to the motor fibers interferes with muscle control and can cause weakness, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity. Muscle cramping may be a sign of motor nerve involvement. Other muscle-related symptoms include lack of muscle control, difficulty or inability to move a part of the body (paralysis), muscle atrophy, muscle twitching (fasciculation) or cramping, difficulty breathing or swallowing, falling (from legs buckling or tripping over toes), or lack of dexterity (such as the inability to button a shirt). Autonomic changes: The autonomic nerves control involuntary or semivoluntary functions, such as control of internal organs and blood pressure. Damage to autonomic nerves can cause blurred vision, decreased ability to sweat (anhidrosis), dizziness that occurs when standing up or fainting associated with a fall in blood pressure, heat intolerance with exertion (decreased ability to regulate body temperature), nausea or vomiting after meals, abdominal bloating (swelling), feeling full after eating a small amount (early satiety), diarrhea, constipation, unintentional weight loss (more than 5% of body weight), urinary incontinence, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate (urinary hesitancy), and male impotence.',\n",

Gums are swollen and bleed easily, and the mucous membrane is extremely tender. Papulovesicular ulcers appear in the mouth and throat and eventually become punched-out lesions with reddened areolae. Submaxillary lymphadenitis is common. Pain usually disappears 2 to 4 days before healing of ulcers is complete. If the child with stomatitis sucks his thumb, these lesions spread to the hand. P A patient with aphthous stomatitis typically reports burning, tingling, and slight swelling of the mucous membrane. Single or multiple shallow ulcers with whitish centers and red borders appear and heal at one site and then reappear at another.',\n",
              " 'Gastroesophageal reflux': \"GERD doesn't always cause symptoms, and in patients showing clinical effects, it isn't always possible to confirm physiologic reflux. The most common feature of GERD is heartburn, which may become more severe with vigorous exercise, bending, or lying down, and may be relieved by antacids or sitting upright. The pain of esophageal spasm resulting from reflux esophagitis tends to be chronic and may mimic angina pectoris, radiating to the neck, jaws, and arms. Other symptoms include odynophagia, which may be followed by a dull substernal ache from severe, long-term reflux; dysphagia from esophageal spasm, stricture, or esophagitis; and bleeding (bright red or dark brown). Rarely, nocturnal regurgitation wakens the patient with coughing, choking, and a mouthful of saliva. Reflux may be associated with hiatal hernia. Direct hiatal hernia becomes clinically significant only when reflux is confirmed. Pulmonary symptoms result from reflux of gastric contents into the throat and subsequent aspiration; they include chronic pulmonary disease or nocturnal wheezing, bronchitis, asthma, morning hoarseness, and cough. In children, other signs consist of failure to thrive and forceful vomiting from esophageal irritation. Such vomiting sometimes causes aspiration pneumonia.\",\n",
              " 'Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia': 'A neonate with type C tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia appears to swallow normally but soon after swallowing coughs, struggles, becomes cyanotic, and stops breathing as he aspirates fluids returning from the blind pouch of the esophagus through his nose and mouth. Stomach distention may cause respiratory distress; air and gastric contents (bile and gastric secretions) may reflux through the fistula into the trachea, resulting in chemical pneumonitis. An infant with type A esophageal atresia appears normal at birth. The infant swallows normally, but as secretions fill the esophageal sac and overflow into the oropharynx, he develops mucus in the oropharynx and drools excessively. When the infant is fed, regurgitation and respiratory distress follow aspiration. Suctioning the mucus and secretions temporarily relieves these symptoms. Excessive secretions and drooling in the neonate strongly suggest esophageal atresia. Repeated episodes of pneumonitis, pulmonary infection, and abdominal distention may signal type E (or H- type) tracheoesophageal fistula. When a child with this disorder drinks, he coughs, chokes, and becomes cyanotic. Excessive mucus builds up in the oropharynx. Crying forces air from the trachea into the esophagus, producing abdominal distention. Because such a child may appear normal at birth, this type of P tracheoesophageal fistula may be overlooked, and diagnosis may be delayed as long as 1 year. Type B (proximal fistula) and type D (fistula to both segments) cause immediate aspiration of saliva into the airway and bacterial pneumonitis.',\n",

Bloody vomitus containing pieces of esophageal tissue signals severe damage. Signs of esophageal perforation and mediastinitis, especially crepitation, indicate destruction of the entire esophagus. Inability to speak implies laryngeal damage. The acute phase subsides in 3 to 4 days, enabling the patient to eat again. Fever suggests secondary infection. Symptoms of dysphagia return P if stricture develops, usually within weeks; rarely, stricture is delayed and develops several years after the injury.',\n",
              " 'Mallory-Weiss syndrome': 'Mallory-Weiss syndrome typically begins with vomiting of blood or passing large amounts of blood rectally a few hours to several days after forceful vomiting. The bleeding, which may be accompanied by epigastric or back pain, may range from mild to massive, but is usually more profuse than in esophageal rupture. In Mallory-Weiss syndrome, the blood vessels are only partially severed, preventing retraction and closure of the lumen.',\n",
              " 'Esophageal diverticula': \"Midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula with an associated motor disturbance (achalasia or spasm) seldom produce symptoms, although the patient may experience dysphagia and heartburn. Zenker's diverticulum, however, produces distinctly staged symptoms, beginning with initial throat irritation followed by dysphagia and near-complete obstruction. In early stages, regurgitation occurs soon after eating; in later stages, regurgitation after eating is delayed and may even occur during sleep, leading to food aspiration and pulmonary infection. ELDER TIP Hoarseness, asthma, and pneumonitis may be the only signs of esophageal diverticula in elderly patients. Other signs and symptoms include noise when liquids are swallowed, chronic cough, hoarseness, a bad taste in the mouth or foul breath and, rarely, bleeding.\",\n",
              " 'Hiatal hernia': \"Typically, a paraesophageal hernia produces no symptoms; it's usually an incidental finding during a barium swallow or when testing for occult blood. Because this type of hernia leaves the closing mechanism of the cardiac sphincter unchanged, it rarely causes acid reflux or reflux esophagitis. Symptoms result from displacement or stretching of the stomach and may include a feeling of fullness in the chest or pain resembling angina pectoris. Even if it produces no symptoms, this type of hernia needs surgical treatment because of the high risk of strangulation that can occur when a large portion of stomach becomes caught above the diaphragm. A sliding hernia without an incompetent sphincter produces no reflux or symptoms and, consequently, doesn't require treatment. When a sliding hernia causes symptoms, they are typical of gastric reflux, resulting from the incompetent lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and may include the following: P Pyrosis (heartburn) occurs 1 to 4 hours after eating (especially overeating) and is aggravated by reclining, belching, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. It may be accompanied by regurgitation or vomiting. Retrosternal or substernal chest pain results from reflux of gastric contents, stomach distention, and spasm or altered motor activity. Chest pain usually occurs after meals or at bedtime and is aggravated by reclining, belching, and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Other common symptoms reflect possible complications: Dysphagia occurs when the hernia produces esophagitis, esophageal ulceration, or stricture, especially with ingestion of very hot or cold foods, alcoholic beverages, or a large amount of food. Bleeding may be mild or massive, frank or occult; the source may be esophagitis or erosions of the gastric pouch. Severe pain and shock result from incarceration, in which a large portion of the stomach is caught above the diaphragm (usually occurs with paraesophageal hernia). Incarceration may lead to perforation of the gastric ulcer and strangulation and gangrene of the herniated portion of the stomach. It requires immediate surgery.\",\n",
              " 'Gastritis': 'After exposure to the offending substance, the patient with acute gastritis typically reports a rapid onset of symptoms, such as epigastric discomfort, indigestion, cramping, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis. The symptoms last from a few hours to a few days. The patient with chronic gastritis may describe similar symptoms or may have only mild epigastric discomfort, or his complaints may be vague, such as an intolerance for spicy or fatty foods or slight pain relieved by eating.

However, gastroenteritis in adults is usually an acute, self-limiting, nonfatal disease producing diarrhea, abdominal discomfort (ranging from cramping to pain), nausea, and vomiting. Other possible signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, and borborygmi. In children, the elderly, and the debilitated, gastroenteritis produces the same symptoms, but these patients' intolerance to electrolyte and fluid losses leads to a higher mortality.\",\n",
              " 'Peptic ulcers': 'Heartburn and indigestion usually signal the beginning of a gastric ulcer attack. Eating stretches the gastric wall and may cause or, in some cases, relieve pain and feelings of fullness and distention. Other typical effects include weight loss and repeated episodes of massive GI bleeding. Duodenal ulcers produce heartburn, well-localized midepigastric pain (relieved by food), weight gain (because the patient eats to relieve discomfort), and a peculiar sensation of hot water bubbling in the back of the throat. Attacks usually occur about 2 hours after meals, whenever the stomach is empty, or after consumption of orange juice, coffee, aspirin, or alcohol. Exacerbations tend to recur several times per year and then fade into remission. Vomiting and other digestive disturbances are rare. Ulcers may penetrate the pancreas and cause severe back pain. Other complications of peptic ulcers include perforation, hemorrhage, and pyloric obstruction. Ulcers may, on occasion, produce no symptoms.',\n",
              " 'Ulcerative colitis': \"The hallmark of ulcerative colitis is recurrent attacks of bloody diarrhea, in many cases containing pus and mucus, interspersed with asymptomatic remissions. The intensity of these attacks varies with the extent of inflammation. It isn't uncommon for a patient with ulcerative colitis to have as many as 15 to 20 liquid, bloody stools daily. Other symptoms include spastic rectum and anus, abdominal pain, irritability, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Ulcerative colitis may lead to complications, such as hemorrhage, stricture, or perforation of the colon. Other complications include joint inflammation, ankylosing spondylitis, eye lesions, mouth ulcers, liver disease, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Scientists think that these complications occur when the immune system triggers inflammation in other parts of the body. These disorders are usually mild and disappear when the colitis is treated. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer; children with ulcerative colitis may experience impaired growth and sexual development.\",\n",
              " 'Necrotizing enterocolitis': 'Neonates who have suffered from perinatal hypoxemia have the potential for developing NEC. A distended (especially tense or rigid) abdomen with gastric retention is the earliest and most common sign of oncoming NEC, which usually appears 1 to 10 days after birth. Other clinical features are increasing residual gastric contents (which may contain bile), bile-stained vomitus, and occult blood in the stool. About 25% of patients have bloody diarrhea. A red or shiny, taut abdomen may indicate peritonitis. Nonspecific signs and symptoms include thermal instability, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, jaundice, and DIC. The major complication is perforation, which requires surgery. Recurrence of NEC and mechanical and functional abnormalities of the intestine, especially stricture, are P the usual cause of residual intestinal malfunction in any infant who survives acute NEC; this complication may develop as late as 3 months postoperatively.',\n",

Acute inflammatory signs and symptoms mimic appendicitis and include steady, colicky pain in the right lower quadrant, cramping, tenderness, flatulence, nausea, fever, and diarrhea. Bleeding may occur and, although usually mild, may be massive. Bloody stools may also occur. Chronic symptoms, which are more typical of the disease, are more persistent and less severe; they include diarrhea (four to six stools per day) with pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant, steatorrhea (excess fat in feces), marked weight loss and, rarely, clubbing of fingers. The patient may complain of weakness and fatigue. Complications include intestinal obstruction, fistula formation between the small bowel and the bladder, perianal and perirectal abscesses and fistulas, intra- abdominal abscesses, and perforation.',\n",

These symptoms alternate with constipation or normal bowel function. Stools are commonly small and contain visible mucus. Dyspepsia and abdominal distention may occur. Symptoms of IBS are two to three times more common in women than in men, with women comprising 80% of patients with a more severe form of the disorder.',\n",
              " 'Celiac disease': \"Celiac disease produces clinical effects on many body systems: GI symptoms include recurrent attacks of diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal distention due to flatulence, stomach cramps, weakness, anorexia and, occasionally, increased appetite without weight gain. Atrophy of intestinal villi leads to malabsorption of fat, carbohydrates, and protein as well as loss of calories, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, and K), calcium, and essential minerals and electrolytes. In adults, celiac disease produces multiple nonspecific ulcers in the small bowel, which may perforate or bleed. Hematologic effects include normochromic, hypochromic, or macrocytic anemia due to poor absorption of folate, iron, and vitamin B12 and to hypoprothrombinemia from jejunal loss of vitamin K. Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, tetany, and bone pain (especially in the lower back, rib cage, and pelvis) are some of the musculoskeletal symptoms of celiac disease. These signs and symptoms are due to calcium loss and vitamin D deficiency, which weakens the skeleton, causing rickets in children and compression fractures in adults. Neurologic effects may include peripheral neuropathy, seizures, or paresthesia. Dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, and acne rosacea are some of the dermatologic effects of celiac disease. Deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids may cause generalized fine, sparse, prematurely gray hair; brittle nails; and localized hyperpigmentation on the face, lips, or mucosa. Endocrine symptoms include amenorrhea, hypometabolism and, possibly, with severe malabsorption, adrenocortical insufficiency. Psychosocial effects include mood changes and irritability. Symptoms may develop during the first year of life, when gluten is introduced into the child's diet as cereal. Clinical effects may disappear during adolescence and reappear in adulthood. One theory proposes that the age at which symptoms first appear depends on the strength of the genetic factor: A strong factor produces symptoms during the child's first 4 years; a weak factor, in late childhood or adulthood.\",\n",
              " 'Diverticular disease': \"Diverticulosis usually produces no symptoms but may cause recurrent left lower quadrant pain, which is commonly accompanied by alternating constipation and diarrhea and is relieved by defecation or the passage of flatus. Symptoms resemble irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and suggest that both disorders may coexist. Mild diverticulitis produces moderate left lower abdominal pain, mild nausea, gas, irregular bowel habits, low-grade fever, and leukocytosis. In severe diverticulitis, the diverticula can rupture and produce abscesses or peritonitis, which occurs in up to 20% of such patients. Symptoms of rupture include abdominal rigidity and left lower quadrant pain. Peritonitis follows release of fecal material from the rupture site and causes signs of sepsis and shock (high fever, chills, and hypotension). Rupture of the diverticulum near a vessel may cause microscopic or massive hemorrhage, depending on the vessel's size. Chronic diverticulitis may cause fibrosis and adhesions that narrow the bowel's lumen and lead to bowel obstruction. Symptoms of incomplete obstruction are constipation, ribbonlike stools, intermittent diarrhea, and abdominal distention. Increasing obstruction causes abdominal rigidity and pain, diminishing or absent bowel sounds, nausea, and vomiting.\",\n",
              " 'Appendicitis': \"Typically, appendicitis begins with generalized or localized abdominal pain in the right upper abdomen, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting (rarely profuse). Pain eventually localizes in the right lower abdomen (McBurney's point) with abdominal “boardlike” rigidity, retractive respirations, increasing tenderness, increasingly severe abdominal spasms and, almost invariably, rebound tenderness. (Rebound tenderness on the opposite side of the abdomen suggests peritoneal inflammation.) Later signs and symptoms include constipation or diarrhea, slight fever, and tachycardia. The patient may walk bent over or lie with his right knee flexed to reduce pain.\",\n",
              " 'Peritonitis': 'The key symptom of peritonitis is sudden, severe, and diffuse abdominal pain that tends to intensify and localize in the area of the underlying disorder. For instance, if appendicitis causes the rupture, pain eventually localizes in the right lower quadrant. Many patients display weakness, pallor, excessive sweating, and cold skin as a result of excessive loss of fluid, electrolytes, and protein into the abdominal cavity. Decreased intestinal motility and paralytic ileus result from the effect of bacterial toxins on the intestinal muscles. Intestinal obstruction causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal rigidity. Other clinical characteristics include hypotension, tachycardia, signs and symptoms of dehydration (oliguria, thirst, dry swollen tongue, and P pinched skin), an acutely tender abdomen associated with rebound tenderness, temperature of 103° F (39.4° C) or higher, and hypokalemia. Inflammation of the diaphragmatic peritoneum may cause shoulder pain and hiccups. Abdominal distention and resulting upward displacement of the diaphragm may decrease respiratory capacity. Typically, the patient with peritonitis tends to breathe shallowly and move as little as possible to minimize pain. He may lie on his back, with his knees flexed, to relax abdominal muscles.',\n",
              " 'Intestinal obstruction': 'Colicky pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention characterize small-bowel obstruction. It may also cause drowsiness, intense thirst, malaise, and aching and may dry up oral mucous membranes and the tongue. Auscultation reveals bowel sounds, borborygmi, and rushes; occasionally, these are loud enough to be heard without a stethoscope. Palpation elicits abdominal tenderness, with moderate distention; rebound tenderness occurs when obstruction has caused strangulation with ischemia. In late stages, signs of hypovolemic shock result from progressive dehydration and plasma loss.',\n",
              " 'Inguinal hernia': 'Inguinal hernia usually causes a lump to appear over the herniated area when the patient stands or strains. The lump disappears when the patient is supine. Tension on the herniated contents may cause a sharp, steady pain in the groin, which fades when the hernia is reduced. Strangulation produces severe pain and may lead to partial or complete bowel obstruction and even intestinal necrosis. Partial bowel obstruction may cause anorexia, vomiting, pain and tenderness in the groin, an irreducible mass, and diminished bowel sounds. Complete obstruction may cause shock, high fever, absent bowel sounds, and bloody stools.',\n",
              " 'Intussusception': 'In an infant or child, intussusception produces four cardinal clinical effects: Intermittent attacks of colicky pain cause the child to scream, draw his legs up to his abdomen, turn pale and diaphoretic and, possibly, display grunting respirations. Vomiting of stomach contents may occur initially, followed by further vomiting of bilestained or fecal material. “Currant-jelly” stools, containing a mixture of blood and mucus, may be observed. The patient will have a tender, distended abdomen, with a palpable, sausage-shaped abdominal mass; the viscera are usually absent from the right lower quadrant. In adults, intussusception produces nonspecific, chronic, and intermittent symptoms, including colicky abdominal pain and tenderness, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally constipation), bloody stools, and weight loss. Abdominal pain usually localizes in the right lower quadrant, radiates to the back, and increases with eating. Adults with severe intussusception may develop strangulation with excruciating pain, abdominal distention, and tachycardia.',\n",
              " 'Volvulus': 'Vomiting and rapid, marked abdominal distention follow sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, bloody stools, constipation, and shock may occur.

However, a severe attack causes extreme pain, persistent vomiting, abdominal rigidity, diminished bowel activity (suggesting peritonitis), crackles at lung bases, and left pleural effusion. Progression produces extreme malaise and restlessness, with mottled skin, tachycardia, low-grade fever (100° to 102° F [37.7° to 38.8° C]), and cold, sweaty extremities. The proximity of the inflamed pancreas to the bowel may cause ileus. If pancreatitis damages the islets of Langerhans, complications may include diabetes mellitus. Fulminant pancreatitis causes massive hemorrhage and total destruction of the pancreas, resulting in diabetic acidosis, shock, or coma.',\n",
              " 'Hemorrhoids': \"Although hemorrhoids may be asymptomatic, they characteristically cause painless, intermittent bleeding, which occurs on defecation. Bright red blood appears on stool or on toilet paper due to injury of the fragile mucosa covering the hemorrhoid. These first-degree hemorrhoids may itch because of poor anal hygiene. When second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse, they're usually painless and spontaneously return to the anal canal following defecation. Third-degree hemorrhoids cause constant discomfort and prolapse in response to any increase in intra \\x02abdominal pressure. They must be manually reduced. Thrombosis of external hemorrhoids produces sudden rectal pain and a subcutaneous, large, firm lump that the patient can feel. If hemorrhoids cause severe or recurrent bleeding, they may lead to secondary anemia with significant pallor, fatigue, and weakness; however, such systemic complications are rare.\",\n",
              " 'Anorectal abscess and fistula': 'Characteristics are throbbing pain and tenderness at the site of the abscess.

              " 'Rectal polyps': \"Because rectal polyps don't generally cause symptoms, they're usually discovered incidentally during a digital examination or rectosigmoidoscopy. Rectal bleeding is a common sign; high rectal polyps leave a streak of blood on the stool, whereas low rectal polyps bleed freely. Rectal polyps vary in appearance. Common polypoid adenomas are small, multiple lesions that are redder than normal mucosa. They're commonly pedunculated (attached to rectal mucosa by a long, thin stalk) and granular, with a red, lobular, or eroded surface. Villous adenomas are usually sessile (attached to the mucosa by a wide base) and vary in size from 0.5 to 12 cm. They are soft, friable, and finely lobulated. They may grow large and cause painful defecation; however, because adenomas are soft, they rarely cause bowel obstruction. Sometimes adenomas prolapse outside the anus, expelling parts of the adenoma with feces. These polyps may cause diarrhea, bloody stools, and subsequent fluid and electrolyte depletion, with hypotension and oliguria. In hereditary polyposis, rectal polyps resemble benign adenomas but occur as hundreds of small (0.5 cm) lesions carpeting the entire mucosal surface. Associated signs include diarrhea, bloody stools, and secondary anemia. In patients with hereditary polyposis, changes in bowel habits with abdominal pain usually signal rectosigmoid cancer. P Juvenile polyps are large, inflammatory lesions, commonly without an epithelial covering. Mucus-filled cysts cover their usually smooth surface.

Other clinical features include continuous or intermittent purulent drainage, followed by development of an abscess, chills, fever, headache, and malaise.',\n",
              " 'Rectal prolapse': 'In rectal prolapse, protrusion of tissue from the rectum may occur during defecation or walking. Other symptoms include a persistent sensation of rectal fullness, bloody diarrhea, pain in the lower abdomen due to ulceration, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and rectal incontinence. Hemorrhoids or rectal polyps may coexist with a prolapse.',\n",
              " 'Anal fissure': 'Onset of an acute anal fissure is characterized by tearing, cutting, or burning pain during or immediately after a bowel movement. A few drops of blood may streak toilet paper or underclothes. Painful anal sphincter spasms result from ulceration of a “sentinel pile” (swelling at the lower end of the fissure). A fissure may heal spontaneously and completely or it may partially heal and break open again. Chronic fissure produces scar tissue that hampers normal bowel evacuation.',\n",
              " 'Pruritus ani': 'The key symptom of pruritus ani is perianal itching or burning after a bowel movement, during stress, or at night. In acute pruritus ani, scratching produces reddened skin, with weeping excoriations; in chronic pruritus ani, skin becomes thick and leathery, with excessive pigmentation.',\n",

              " 'Medullary sponge kidney': 'Symptoms usually appear only as a result of complications and are seldom present before adulthood. Complications include formation of calcium oxylate stones, which lodge in the dilated cystic collecting ducts or pass through a ureter, and infection secondary to dilation of the ducts. These complications, which occur in about 30% of patients, are likely to produce severe colic, hematuria, lower urinary tract infection ([UTI]; burning on urination, urgency, frequency), and pyelonephritis. Secondary impairment of renal function from obstruction and infection occurs in only about 10% of patients.',\n",
              " 'Polycystic kidney disease': \"Adult polycystic kidney disease is commonly asymptomatic through the patient's 40s, but may induce nonspecific symptoms, such as hypertension, polyuria, and recurrent UTIs. Later, the patient develops overt symptoms related to the enlarging kidney mass, such as lumbar pain, widening girth, and swollen or tender abdomen. Abdominal pain is usually worsened by exertion and relieved by lying down. In advanced stages, this disease may cause recurrent hematuria, life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding resulting from cyst rupture, proteinuria, and colicky abdominal pain from the ureteral passage of clots or calculi. Generally, about 10 years after symptoms appear, progressive compression of kidney structures by the enlarging mass produces renal failure and uremia. Hypertension is found in about 20% to 30% of children and up to 75% of adults due to intrarenal ischemia, which activates the renin-angiotensin system.\",\n",

Symptoms include mild to moderate edema, oliguria (less than 400 ml/24 hours), proteinuria, azotemia, hematuria, and fatigue. Mild to severe hypertension may result from either sodium or water retention (due to decreased GFR) or inappropriate renin release. Heart failure from hypervolemia leads to pulmonary edema.',\n",

Some patients may also experience fever, rash, and eosinophilia. However, ATN is usually difficult to recognize in its early stages because effects of the critically ill patient's primary disease may mask the symptoms of ATN. The first recognizable effect may be decreased urine output. Generally, hyperkalemia and the characteristic uremic syndrome soon follow, with oliguria (or, rarely, anuria) and confusion, which may progress to uremic coma. Other possible complications may include heart failure, uremic pericarditis, pulmonary edema, uremic lung, anemia, anorexia, intractable vomiting, and poor wound healing due to debilitation.\",\n",

Gross hematuria may be present. When arterial occlusion causes infarction, the affected kidney is small and not palpable. Renovascular hypertension, a frequent complication that may occur several days after infarction, results from reduced blood flow, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism.',\n",
              " 'Renal calculi': 'Clinical effects vary with size, location, and etiology of the calculi. Pain, the key symptom, usually results from obstruction; large, rough calculi occlude the opening to the ureter and increase the frequency and force of peristaltic contractions. The pain of classic renal colic travels from the costovertebral angle to the flank, to the suprapubic region and external genitalia. The intensity of this pain fluctuates and may be excruciating at its peak. If calculi are in the renal pelvis and calyces, pain may be more constant and dull. Back pain (from calculi that produce an obstruction within a kidney) and severe abdominal pain (from calculi traveling down a ureter) may also occur. (See Types of renal calculi.) Nausea and vomiting usually accompany severe pain.',\n",
              " 'Renal vein thrombosis': 'Clinical features of renal vein thrombosis vary with speed of onset. Rapid onset of venous obstruction produces severe lumbar pain and tenderness in the epigastric region and the costovertebral angle. Other characteristic features include fever, leukocytosis, pallor, hematuria, proteinuria, peripheral edema and, when the obstruction is bilateral, oliguria and other uremic signs. The kidneys enlarge and become easily palpable. Hypertension is unusual but may develop. Gradual onset causes symptoms of nephrotic syndrome. Peripheral edema is possible but pain is generally absent. Other clinical signs include proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Infants with this disease have enlarged kidneys, oliguria, and renal insufficiency that may progress to acute or chronic renal failure.',\n",

In late stages of progressive chronic glomerulonephritis, it may accelerate to uremic symptoms, such as azotemia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, dyspnea, malaise, and fatigability. Mild to severe edema and anemia may accompany these symptoms. Severe hypertension may cause cardiac hypertrophy, leading to heart failure, and may accelerate the development of advanced renal failure, eventually necessitating dialysis or transplantation.',\n",

Significant complications include heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke and, occasionally, renal failure.',\n",
              " 'Hydronephrosis': 'Clinical features of hydronephrosis vary with the cause of the obstruction. In some patients, hydronephrosis produces no symptoms or only mild pain and slightly decreased urinary flow; in others, it may produce severe, colicky renal pain or dull flank pain that may radiate to the groin, and gross urinary abnormalities, such as hematuria, pyuria, dysuria, alternating oliguria and polyuria, or complete anuria. Other symptoms of hydronephrosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal fullness, pain on urination, dribbling, or hesitancy. Unilateral obstruction may cause pain on only one side, usually in the flank area. The most common complication of an obstructed kidney is infection (pyelonephritis) due to stasis that exacerbates renal damage and may create a life-threatening crisis. Paralytic ileus frequently accompanies acute obstructive uropathy.',\n",

              " 'Chronic renal failure': \"Chronic renal failure produces major changes in all body systems: Renal and urologic: Initially, salt-wasting and consequent hyponatremia produce hypotension, dry mouth, loss of skin turgor, listlessness, fatigue, and nausea; later, somnolence and confusion P develop. As the number of functioning nephrons decreases, so does the kidneys' capacity to excrete sodium, resulting in salt retention and overload. Accumulation of potassium causes muscle irritability, then muscle weakness as the potassium level continues to rise. Fluid overload and metabolic acidosis also occur. Urinary output decreases; urine is very dilute and contains casts and crystals. Cardiovascular: Renal failure leads to hypertension, arrhythmias (including life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation), cardiomyopathy, uremic pericarditis, pericardial effusion with possible cardiac tamponade, heart failure, and periorbital and peripheral edema. Respiratory: Pulmonary changes include reduced pulmonary macrophage activity with increased susceptibility to infection, pulmonary edema, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub and effusions, crackles, thick sputum, uremic pleuritis and uremic lung (or uremic pneumonitis), dyspnea due to heart failure, and Kussmaul's respirations as a result of acidosis. GI: Inflammation and ulceration of GI mucosa cause stomatitis, gum ulceration and bleeding and, possibly, parotitis, esophagitis, gastritis, duodenal ulcers, lesions on the small and large bowel, uremic colitis, pancreatitis, and proctitis. Other GI symptoms include a metallic taste in the mouth, uremic fetor (ammonia smell to breath), anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Cutaneous: Typically, the skin is pallid, yellowish bronze, dry, and scaly. Other cutaneous symptoms include severe itching; purpura; ecchymoses; petechiae; uremic frost (most often in critically ill or terminal patients); thin, brittle fingernails with characteristic lines; and dry, brittle hair that may change color and fall out easily. Neurologic: Restless leg syndrome, one of the first signs of peripheral neuropathy, causes pain, burning, and itching in the legs and feet, which may be relieved by voluntarily shaking, moving, or rocking them. Eventually, this condition progresses to paresthesia and motor nerve dysfunction (usually bilateral footdrop) unless dialysis is initiated. Other signs and symptoms include muscle cramping and twitching, shortened memory and attention span, apathy, drowsiness, irritability, confusion, coma, and seizures. EEG changes indicate metabolic encephalopathy. Endocrine: Common endocrine abnormalities include stunted growth patterns in children (even with elevated growth hormone levels), infertility and decreased libido in both sexes, amenorrhea and cessation of menses in females, and impotence, decreased sperm production, and testicular atrophy in males. Increased aldosterone secretion (related to increased renin production) and impaired carbohydrate metabolism (increased blood glucose levels similar to diabetes mellitus) may also occur. Hematopoietic: Anemia, decreased red blood cell (RBC) survival time, blood loss from dialysis and GI bleeding, mild thrombocytopenia, and platelet defects occur.

              " 'Neurogenic bladder': 'Neurogenic bladder produces a wide range of clinical effects, depending on the underlying cause and its effect on the structural integrity of the bladder. Usually, this disorder causes some degree of incontinence, changes in initiation or interruption of micturition, and the inability to empty the bladder completely. Other effects of neurogenic bladder include vesicoureteral reflux, deterioration or infection in the upper urinary tract, and hydroureteral nephrosis. Depending on the site and extent of the spinal cord lesion, spastic neurogenic bladder may produce involuntary or frequent scanty urination, without a feeling of bladder fullness, and possibly spontaneous spasms of the arms and legs. Anal sphincter tone may be increased. Tactile stimulation of the abdomen, thighs, or genitalia may precipitate voiding and spontaneous contractions of the arms and legs. With cord lesions in the upper thoracic (cervical) level, bladder distention can trigger hyperactive autonomic reflexes, resulting in severe hypertension, bradycardia, and headaches. Flaccid neurogenic bladder may be associated with overflow incontinence, diminished anal sphincter tone, and a greatly distended bladder (evident on percussion or palpation), but without the accompanying feeling of bladder fullness due to sensory impairment.',\n",

An acute hydrocele may also result from inflammation.',\n",
              " 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia': 'Clinical features of BPH depend on the extent of prostatic enlargement and the lobes affected. Characteristically, the condition starts with a group of symptoms known as prostatism: reduced urine stream caliber and force, urinary hesitancy, and difficulty starting micturition (resulting in straining, feeling of incomplete voiding, and an interrupted stream). As the obstruction increases, it causes frequent urination with nocturia, dribbling, urine retention, incontinence, and possibly hematuria. Physical examination indicates a visible midline mass above the symphysis pubis that represents an incompletely emptied bladder; rectal palpation discloses an enlarged prostate. Examination may detect secondary anemia and, possibly, renal insufficiency secondary to obstruction. P As BPH worsens, complete urinary obstruction may follow infection or use of decongestants, tranquilizers, alcohol, anti-depressants, or anticholinergics. Complications include infection, renal insufficiency, hemorrhage, and shock.',\n",

It typically includes progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness or some combination of these signs or symptoms. During an acute attack, the cough sounds tight and dry. As the attack subsides, tenacious mucoid sputum is produced (except in young children, who don't expectorate). Characteristic wheezing may be accompanied by coarse rhonchi, but fine crackles aren't heard unless associated with a related complication. Between acute attacks, breath sounds may be normal. The intensity of breath sounds in symptomatic asthma is typically reduced. A prolonged phase of forced expiration is typical of airflow obstruction. Evidence of lung hyperinflation (use of accessory muscles, for example) is particularly common in children. Acute attacks may be accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. In severe attacks, the patient may be unable to speak more than a few words without pausing for breath. Cyanosis, confusion, and lethargy indicate the onset of respiratory failure.\",\n",

It's usually accompanied by pale, cyanotic, edematous nasal mucosa; red and edematous eyelids and conjunctivae; excessive lacrimation; and headache or sinus pain. Some patients also complain of itching in the throat and malaise. In perennial allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and other extranasal effects are rare, but chronic nasal obstruction is common. In many cases, this obstruction extends to eustachian tube obstruction, particularly in children. In both types of allergic rhinitis, dark circles may appear under the patient's eyes (“allergic shiners”) because of venous congestion in the maxillary sinuses.

              " 'Anaphylaxis': \"An anaphylactic reaction produces sudden physical distress within seconds or minutes (although a delayed or persistent reaction may occur for up to 24 hours) after exposure to an allergen. The reaction's severity is inversely related to the interval between exposure to the allergen and the onset of symptoms. Usually, the first symptoms include a feeling of impending doom or fright, weakness, sweating, sneezing, shortness of breath, nasal pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema, followed rapidly by symptoms in one or more target organs. Cardiovascular symptoms include hypotension, shock and, sometimes, cardiac arrhythmias. If untreated, arrhythmia may precipitate circulatory collapse. Respiratory symptoms can occur at any level in the respiratory tract and commonly include nasal mucosal edema, profuse watery rhinorrhea, itching, nasal congestion, and sudden sneezing attacks. Edema of the upper respiratory tract results in hypopharyngeal and laryngeal obstruction (hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea). This is an early sign of acute respiratory failure, which can be fatal.

In a surgical patient under anesthesia, these symptoms are masked, but blood oozes from mucous membranes or the incision site. Delayed hemolytic reactions can occur up to several weeks after a transfusion, causing fever, an unexpected fall in serum hemoglobin (Hb) level, and jaundice. Allergic reactions are typically afebrile and characterized by urticaria and angioedema, possibly progressing to cough, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vascular instability, shock, and coma. The hallmark of febrile nonhemolytic reactions is mild to severe fever that may begin at the start of transfusion or within 2 hours after its completion. Bacterial contamination produces a high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and, possibly, shock. Symptoms of viral contamination may not appear for several weeks after transfusion.',\n",
              " 'Rheumatoid arthritis': \"RA usually develops insidiously and initially produces nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, persistent low-grade fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and vague articular symptoms. Later, more specific localized articular symptoms develop, commonly in the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. These symptoms usually occur bilaterally and symmetrically and may extend to the wrists, knees, elbows, and ankles. The affected joints stiffen after inactivity, especially upon rising in the morning. The fingers may assume a spindle shape from marked edema and joint congestion. The joints become tender and painful, at first only when the patient moves them, but eventually even at rest. They commonly feel hot to the touch. Ultimately, joint function is diminished. Deformities are common if active disease continues. Proximal interphalangeal joints may develop flexion deformities or become hyperextended. Metacarpophalangeal joints may swell dorsally, and volar subluxation and stretching of tendons may pull the fingers to the ulnar side (“ulnar drift”). The fingers may become fixed in a characteristic “swan's neck” appearance, or “boutonnière” deformity. The hands appear foreshortened, the wrists boggy; carpal tunnel syndrome from synovial pressure on the median nerve causes tingling paresthesia in the fingers. The most common extra-articular finding is the gradual appearance of rheumatoid nodules — subcutaneous, round or oval, nontender masses — usually on pressure areas such as the elbows. Vasculitis can lead to skin lesions, leg ulcers, and multiple systemic complications. Peripheral neuropathy may produce numbness or tingling in the feet or weakness and loss of sensation in the fingers. Stiff, weak, or painful muscles are common. Other common extra-articular effects include pericarditis, pulmonary nodules or fibrosis, pleuritis, scleritis, and episcleritis. Another complication is destruction of the odontoid process, part of the second cervical vertebra. Rarely, cord compression may occur, particularly in patients with long-standing deforming disease. Upper P motor neuron signs and symptoms, such as a positive Babinski's sign and muscle weakness, may also develop. RA can also cause temporomandibular joint disease, which impairs chewing and causes earaches. Other extra-articular findings may include infection, osteoporosis, myositis, cardiopulmonary lesions, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral neuritis.\",\n",
              " 'Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis': \"Signs and symptoms vary with the type of JRA. Affecting boys and girls almost equally, systemic JRA accounts for about 10% of cases. The affected children may have mild, transient arthritis or frank polyarthritis with fever and rash. Joint involvement may not be evident at first, but the child's behavior may clearly suggest joint pain. Such a child may constantly want to sit in a flexed position, may not walk much, or may P refuse to walk at all. Young children with JRA are noticeably irritable and listless. Fever in systemic JRA occurs suddenly and spikes to 103° F (39.4° C) or higher once or twice daily, usually in the late afternoon, then rapidly returns to normal or subnormal. (This “sawtooth” or intermittent spiking fever pattern helps differentiate JRA from other inflammatory disorders.) When fever spikes, an evanescent rheumatoid rash commonly appears, consisting of small pale or salmon pink macules, usually on the trunk and proximal extremities and occasionally on the face, palms, and soles. Massaging or applying heat intensifies this rash. It's usually most conspicuous where the skin has been rubbed or subjected to pressure such as the areas of skin covered by underclothing. Other signs and symptoms of systemic JRA may include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, and nonspecific abdominal pain. Polyarticular JRA accounts for about 40% of cases and is three times more common in females than in males; affected children may be seronegative or seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF). It involves five or more joints and usually develops insidiously. Most commonly involved joints are the wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and small joints of the hands and feet. Polyarticular JRA can also affect larger joints, including the temporomandibular joints, cervical spine, hips, and shoulders. These joints become swollen, tender, and stiff. Usually, the arthritis is symmetrical; it may be remittent or indolent. The patient may run a low-grade fever with daily peaks. Listlessness and weight loss can occur, possibly with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Other signs of polyarticular JRA include subcutaneous nodules on the elbows or heels and noticeable developmental retardation. Seropositive polyarticular JRA, the more severe type, usually occurs late in childhood and can cause destructive arthritis that mimics adult rheumatoid arthritis. Pauciarticular JRA involves few joints (usually no more than four), typically affecting the knees and other large joints. This form accounts for 50% of cases and has major subtypes. The first, pauciarticular JRA with chronic iridocyclitis, most commonly strikes females younger than age 6 and involves the knees, elbows, ankles, or iris. Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body is commonly asymptomatic but may produce pain, redness, blurred vision, and photophobia. The second subtype, pauciarticular JRA with sacroiliitis, usually strikes males (9:1) older than age 8, who tend to test positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. This subtype is characterized by lower extremity arthritis that produces hip, sacroiliac, heel, and foot pain as well as Achilles' tendinitis. These patients may later develop the sacroiliac and lumbar arthritis characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Some also experience acute iritis, but not as many as those with the first subtype. The third subtype includes patients with joint involvement who are antinuclear antibody (ANA) and HLA-B27 negative and don't develop iritis. These patients have a better prognosis than those with the first or second subtype. Common to all types of JRA is joint stiffness in the morning or after periods of inactivity. Back pain and limited range of motion is common. Growth disturbances may also occur, resulting in uneven length of arms or legs due to overgrowth or undergrowth adjacent to inflamed joints.\",\n",

The patient may also complain of a film across his field of vision. Oral dryness (xerostomia) leads to difficulty swallowing and talking; abnormal taste or smell sensation or both; thirst; ulcers of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and lips (especially at the corners of the mouth); and severe dental caries. Dryness of the respiratory tract leads to epistaxis, hoarseness, chronic nonproductive cough, recurrent otitis media, and increased incidence of respiratory infections.

In 90% of patients, joint involvement is similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis. Skin lesions are most commonly erythematous rashes in areas exposed to light. The classic butterfly rash over the nose and cheeks occurs in fewer than 50% of the patients. (See Butterfly rash, page 468.) Ultraviolet rays often provoke or aggravate skin eruptions. Vasculitis can develop (especially in the digits), possibly leading to infarctive lesions, necrotic leg ulcers, or digital gangrene. Raynaud's phenomenon appears in about 20% of P patients. Patchy alopecia and painless ulcers of the mucous membranes are common. Constitutional symptoms of SLE include aching, malaise, fatigue, lowgrade or spiking fever, chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Lymph node enlargement (diffuse or local, and nontender), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation may occur. Females may experience irregular menstrual periods or amenorrhea during the active phase of SLE. About 50% of SLE patients develop signs of cardiopulmonary abnormalities, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, and dyspnea. Myocarditis, endocarditis, tachycardia, parenchymal infiltrates, and pneumonitis may occur. Renal effects may include hematuria, proteinuria, urine sediment, and cellular casts, which may progress to total kidney failure. Urinary tract infections may result from heightened susceptibility to infection. Seizure disorders and mental dysfunction may indicate neurologic damage. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement may produce emotional instability, psychosis, and organic mental syndrome. Headaches, irritability, and depression are common. (See\",\n",
              " 'Fibromyalgia syndrome': \"The primary symptoms is diffuse, dull, aching pain that's typically concentrated across the neck and shoulders and in the lower back and proximal limbs. It can involve all body quadrants (bilateral upper trunk and arms, and bilateral lower trunk and legs) and typically is worse in the morning, when it's associated with stiffness. The pain can vary form day to day and be exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, weather changes, and inactivity. Sleep disturbance and fatigue are commonly reported. The patient awakens feeling fatigued and remains so throughout the day. Fatigue is commonly present from a half hour to several hours after rising in the morning and can last for the rest of the day. Other associated features that can occur with FMS include irritable bowel syndrome, tension headaches, puffy hands (sensation of hand swelling, especially in the morning), and paresthesia.\",\n",
              " \"Goodpasture's syndrome\": \"Goodpasture's syndrome may initially cause malaise, fatigue, and pallor associated with severe iron deficiency anemia. Pulmonary findings range from slight dyspnea and cough with blood-tinged sputum to hemoptysis and frank pulmonary hemorrhage. Subclinical pulmonary bleeding may precede overt hemorrhage and renal disease by months or years. Usually, renal findings are subtler, although some patients note hematuria and peripheral edema.\",\n",
              " \"Reiter's syndrome\": \"The patient with Reiter's syndrome may complain of dysuria, hematuria, urgent and frequent urination, and mucopurulent penile discharge, with swelling and reddening of the urethral meatus. Small painless ulcers may erupt on the glans penis (balanitis). These coalesce to form irregular patches that cover the penis and scrotum. He may also experience suprapubic pain, fever, anorexia with weight loss, and other genitourinary (GU) complications, such as prostatitis and hemorrhagic cystitis. Arthritic symptoms usually follow GU or enteric symptoms and last from 2 to 4 months. Asymmetrical and extremely variable polyarticular P arthritis is most common, with a tendency to develop in weight-bearing joints of the legs and sometimes in the low back or sacroiliac joints. The arthritis is usually acute, with warm, erythematous, and painful joints, but it may be mild, with minimal synovitis. Muscle wasting is common near affected joints. Fingers and toes may swell and appear sausagelike. Ocular symptoms include mild bilateral conjunctivitis, possibly complicated by keratitis, iritis, retinitis, or optic neuritis. In severe cases, burning, itching, and profuse mucopurulent discharge are possible. In 30% of patients, skin lesions (keratoderma blennorrhagicum) develop 4 to 6 weeks after onset of other symptoms and may last for several weeks. These macular to hyperkeratotic lesions commonly resemble those of psoriasis. They usually occur on the palms and soles but can develop anywhere on the trunk, extremities, or scalp. Nails become thick, opaque, and brittle; keratic debris accumulates under the nails. In many patients, painless, transient ulcerations erupt on the buccal mucosa, palate, and tongue.\",\n",
              " 'Scleroderma': \"Scleroderma typically begins with Raynaud's phenomenon — blanching, cyanosis, and erythema of the fingers and toes in response to stress or exposure to cold. Progressive phalangeal resorption may shorten the fingers. Compromised circulation, which results from abnormal thickening of the arterial intima, may cause slowly healing ulcerations on the tips of the fingers or toes that may lead to gangrene. Raynaud's phenomenon may precede scleroderma by months or years. Later symptoms include pain, stiffness, and finger and joint swelling. Skin thickening produces taut, shiny skin over the entire hand and forearm. Facial skin also becomes tight and inelastic, causing a masklike appearance and “pinching” of the mouth. As tightening progresses, contractures may develop. GI dysfunction causes frequent reflux, heartburn, dysphagia, and bloating after meals. These symptoms may cause the patient to decrease food intake and lose weight. Other GI effects include abdominal distention, diarrhea, constipation, and malodorous floating stools.\",\n",
              " 'Polymyositis and dermatomyositis': \"Polymyositis begins acutely or insidiously with muscle weakness, tenderness, and discomfort. It affects proximal muscles more than distal muscles and impairs performance of ordinary activities. The patient may have trouble getting up from a chair, combing his hair, reaching into a high cupboard, climbing stairs, or even raising his head from a pillow. Other muscular symptoms include inability to move against resistance, proximal dysphagia, dysphonia, and difficulty breathing. In dermatomyositis, an erythematous rash usually erupts on the face, neck, upper back, chest, and arms as well as around the nail beds. A characteristic heliotropic rash appears on the eyelids, accompanied by periorbital edema. Gottron's papules (violet, flat-topped lesions) may appear on the interphalangeal joints.\",\n",
              " 'X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia': 'Typically, the infant with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia is asymptomatic until age 6 months, when transplacental maternal immunoglobulins that provided immunity have been depleted. He then develops recurrent bacterial otitis media, pneumonia, dermatitis, bronchitis, and meningitis — usually caused by pneumococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, or other gram-negative organisms. Purulent conjunctivitis, abnormal dental caries, and polyarthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis may also occur. Severe malabsorption associated with infestation by Giardia lamblia may retard development. Despite recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are usually absent.',\n",
              " 'Common variable immunodeficiency': 'In common variable immunodeficiency, pyogenic bacterial infections are characteristic but tend to be chronic rather than acute (as in X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia). Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic bacterial conjunctivitis, and malabsorption (commonly associated with infestation by Giardia lamblia) are usually the first clues to immunodeficiency. Common variable immunodeficiency may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic anemia, and pernicious anemia, and with cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.',\n",
              " 'IgA deficiency': 'Some IgA-deficient patients have no symptoms, possibly because they have extra amounts of low-molecular-weight IgM. This immunoglobulin takes over IgA function and helps maintain immunologic defenses. Among patients who develop symptoms, chronic sinopulmonary infection is the most common. Other effects are respiratory allergy, often triggered by infection; GI tract diseases, such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and regional enteritis; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, immunohemolytic anemia, and chronic hepatitis; and malignant tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, reticulum cell sarcoma, and thymoma. Age of onset varies. Some IgA-deficient children with recurrent respiratory disease and middle ear inflammation may begin to synthesize IgA spontaneously as recurrent infections subside and their condition improves.',\n",
              " 'DiGeorge syndrome': 'Symptoms are usually obvious at birth or shortly thereafter. An infant with DiGeorge syndrome may have low-set prominent ears, notched ear pinnae, a mouth without the usual bow-shaped lip, an undersized jaw, and abnormally wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) that are low-set and posteriorly angulated. Additionally, an infant may have a bifid uvula and a high, arched palate. Congenital heart anomalies are common. Cardiovascular abnormalities include great blood vessel anomalies (these may also develop soon after birth) and tetralogy of Fallot. An infant with thymic hypoplasia (rather than aplasia) may experience a spontaneous return of cell-mediated immunity but can develop severe Tcell deficiencies later in life. This allows exaggerated susceptibility to viral, fungal, or bacterial infections, which may be overwhelming. Hypoparathyroidism, usually associated with DiGeorge syndrome, typically causes tetany, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia (calcium levels less than 7 mg/dl) develops early and is unusually resistant to treatment. It can lead to tetany, seizures, central nervous system damage, and early heart failure. Rare cases of partial immunoglobulin (Ig) A deficiency have been linked to chromosome 1 and deletions of the IgA1 or IgA2 genes. Alterations in chromosome 6 suggest altered major histocompatibility complex, which is reflected in decreased T-cell responses. Aberrations in chromosome 18 are linked to facial abnormalities, nystagmus, hypotonia, atretic or stenotic ear canals, hearing loss, and mental retardation.',\n",
              " 'Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome': \"A person with HIV may remain asymptomatic for months or years. Initially, laboratory evidence or seroconversion to HIV antibodies may be the only clinical evidence of infection. However, as the disease progresses, the patient may develop generalized adenopathy and nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and fevers. As the patient's T-cell count lowers further, neurologic symptoms, opportunistic infections, and certain normally rare P cancers may develop. HIV also destroys lymph nodes and immunologic organs, leading to major dysfunctions of the immunological system. Eventually, HIV advances to AIDS. (Some individuals, termed nonprogressors, develop AIDS very slowly or not at all. They seem to have genetic differences that prevent the virus from attaching to certain immune receptors.)\",\n",
              " 'Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis': \"Chronic candidal infections can affect the skin, mucous membranes, nails, and vagina, usually causing large, circular lesions. These infections seldom produce systemic symptoms but in late stages may be associated with recurrent respiratory tract infections. Other associated conditions include severe viral infections that may precede the onset of endocrinopathy and, sometimes, hepatitis. Involvement of the mouth, nose, and palate may cause speech and eating difficulties. Symptoms of endocrinopathy are peculiar to the organ involved. Tetany and hypocalcemia are most common and are associated with hypoparathyroidism. Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and pernicious anemia are also connected with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Psychiatric disorders are likely because of disfigurement and multiple endocrine aberrations.\",\n",
              " 'Chronic fatigue syndrome': \"CFS has specific symptoms and signs, based on the exclusion of other possible causes. Its characteristic symptom is prolonged, often overwhelming fatigue that's commonly associated with a varying complex of other symptoms that are similar to those of many infections, including myalgia and cephalgia. It may develop within a few hours and can last for 6 months or more. Fatigue isn't relieved by rest and is severe enough to restrict activities of daily living by at least 50%.\",\n",
              " 'Chronic granulomatous disease': 'Usually, the patient with CGD displays signs and symptoms associated with infections of the skin, lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone by age 2. Skin infection is characterized by small, well-localized areas of tenderness. Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp and axilla is also common. Lymph node infection typically causes marked lymphadenopathy with draining lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Many patients develop liver abscess, which may be recurrent and multiple; abdominal tenderness, fever, anorexia, and nausea point to abscess formation. Other common infections include osteomyelitis, which causes localized pain and fever, pneumonia, and gingivitis with severe periodontal disease.',\n",
              " 'Severe combined immunodeficiency disease': 'An extreme susceptibility to infection becomes obvious in the infant with SCID in the first months of life. The infant fails to thrive and develops chronic otitis; sepsis; watery diarrhea (associated with Salmonella or Escherichia coli); recurrent pulmonary infections (usually caused by Pseudomonas, cytomegalovirus, or Pneumocystis jiroveci [formerly carinii]); persistent oral candidiasis, sometimes with esophageal erosions; and possibly fatal viral infections such as chickenpox. P. jiroveci pneumonia usually strikes a severely immunodeficient infant in the first 3 to 5 weeks after birth. Onset is typically insidious, with gradually worsening cough, low-grade fever, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. Chest X-ray characteristically shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.',\n",
              " 'Complement deficiencies': 'Clinical effects vary with the specific deficiency. C2 and C3 deficiencies and C5 familial dysfunction increase susceptibility to bacterial infection (which may involve several body systems simultaneously). C2 and C4 deficiencies are also associated with collagen vascular disease such as lupus erythematosus and with chronic renal failure. C5 dysfunction, a familial defect in infants, causes failure to thrive, diarrhea, and seborrheic dermatitis. C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema) may cause periodic swelling in the face, hands, abdomen, or throat, with potentially fatal laryngeal edema.',\n",
              " 'Hypopituitarism': \"Clinical features of hypopituitarism develop slowly and vary with the severity of the disorder and the number of deficient hormones. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism in adults may include gonadal failure (secondary amenorrhea, impotence, infertility, decreased libido), diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism (fatigue, lethargy, sensitivity to cold, menstrual disturbances), and adrenocortical insufficiency (hypoglycemia, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, orthostatic hypotension). Postpartum necrosis of the pituitary (Sheehan's syndrome) characteristically causes failure of lactation, menstruation, and growth of pubic and axillary hair; and symptoms of thyroid and adrenocortical failure. In children, hypopituitarism causes retarded growth or delayed puberty. Dwarfism usually isn't apparent at birth but early signs begin to appear during the first few months of life; by age 6 months, growth retardation is obvious. Although these children generally enjoy good health, pituitary dwarfism may cause chubbiness due to fat deposits in the lower trunk, delayed secondary tooth eruption and, possibly, hypoglycemia. Growth continues at less than half the normal rate— sometimes extending into the patient's 20s or 30s—to an average height of 4′ (122 cm), with normal proportions. P When hypopituitarism strikes before puberty, it prevents development of secondary sex characteristics (including facial and body hair). In males, it produces undersized testes, penis, and prostate gland; absent or minimal libido; and the inability to initiate and maintain an erection. In females, it usually causes immature development of the breasts, sparse or absent pubic and axillary hair, and primary amenorrhea. Panhypopituitarism may induce a host of mental and physiologic abnormalities, including lethargy, psychosis, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, anemia, and anorexia. However, clinical manifestations of hormonal deficiencies resulting from pituitary destruction don't become apparent until 75% of the gland is destroyed. Total loss of all hormones released by the anterior pituitary is fatal unless treated. Neurologic signs associated with hypopituitarism and produced by pituitary tumors include headache, bilateral temporal hemianopia, loss of visual acuity and, possibly, blindness. Acute hypopituitarism resulting from surgery or infection is often associated with fever, hypotension, vomiting, and hypoglycemia—all characteristic of adrenal insufficiency.\",\n",
              " 'Hyperpituitarism': 'Acromegaly develops slowly and typically produces diaphoresis, oily skin, hypermetabolism, and hypertrichosis. Severe headache, central nervous system impairment, bitemporal hemianopia, loss of visual acuity, and blindness may result from the intrasellar tumor compressing the optic chiasm or nerves. Hypersecretion of hGH produces cartilaginous and connective tissue overgrowth, resulting in a characteristic hulking appearance, with an enlarged supraorbital ridge and thickened ears and nose. Prognathism, projection of the jaw, becomes marked and may interfere with chewing. Laryngeal hypertrophy, paranasal sinus enlargement, and thickening of the tongue cause the voice to sound deep and hollow. Distal phalanges display an arrowhead appearance on X-rays, and the fingers are thickened. Irritability, hostility, and various psychological disturbances may occur. Prolonged effects of excessive hGH secretion include bowlegs, barrel chest, arthritis, osteoporosis, kyphosis, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. Both gigantism and acromegaly may also cause signs of glucose intolerance and clinically apparent diabetes mellitus because of the insulinantagonistic character of hGH. If acromegaly is left untreated, the patient is at risk for premature cardiovascular disease, colon polyps, and colon cancer. Gigantism develops abruptly, producing some of the same skeletal abnormalities seen in acromegaly. As the disease progresses, the pituitary tumor enlarges and invades normal tissue, resulting in the loss of other trophic hormones, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and corticotropin, thus causing the target organ to stop functioning.',\n",
              " 'Diabetes insipidus': \"The patient's history typically shows an abrupt onset of extreme polyuria (usually 4 to 16 L/day of dilute urine but sometimes as much as 30 L/day). As a result, the patient is extremely thirsty and drinks great quantities of water to compensate for the body's water loss. This disorder may also result in nocturia. In severe cases, it may lead to extreme fatigue from inadequate rest caused by frequent voiding and excessive thirst. Other characteristic features of diabetes insipidus include signs and symptoms of dehydration (poor tissue turgor, dry mucous membranes, constipation, muscle weakness, dizziness, and hypotension). These symptoms usually begin abruptly, commonly appearing within 1 to 2 days after a basal skull fracture, a stroke, or surgery. Relieving cerebral edema or increased intracranial pressure may cause all of these symptoms to subside just as rapidly as they began.\",\n",
              " 'Hypothyroidism in adults': 'Typically, the early clinical features of hypothyroidism are vague: fatigue, menstrual changes, hypercholesterolemia, forgetfulness, sensitivity to cold, unexplained weight gain, and constipation. As the disorder progresses, characteristic myxedematous signs and symptoms appear: decreasing mental stability; dry, flaky, inelastic skin; puffy face, hands, and feet; hoarseness; periorbital edema; upper eyelid droop; dry, sparse hair; and thick, brittle nails. (See Facial signs of myxedema.) Cardiovascular involvement leads to decreased cardiac output, slow pulse rate, signs of poor peripheral circulation and, occasionally, an enlarged heart. Other common effects include anorexia, abdominal distention, menorrhagia, decreased libido, infertility, ataxia, intention tremor, and nystagmus. Reflexes show delayed relaxation time (especially in the Achilles tendon).',\n",
              " 'Hypothyroidism in children': \"The weight and length of an infant with infantile cretinism appear normal at birth, but characteristic signs of hypothyroidism develop by the time he's 3 to 6 months old. In a breast-fed infant the onset of most symptoms may be delayed until weaning because breast milk contains small amounts of thyroid hormone. Typically, an infant with cretinism sleeps excessively, seldom cries (except for occasional hoarse crying), and is inactive. Because of this, his parents may describe him as a “good baby—no trouble at all.” However, such behavior actually results from lowered metabolism and progressive mental impairment. The infant with cretinism also exhibits abnormal deep tendon reflexes, hypotonic abdominal muscles, a protruding abdomen, and slow, awkward movements. He has feeding difficulties, develops constipation and, because his immature liver can't conjugate bilirubin, becomes jaundiced. His large, protruding tongue obstructs respiration, making breathing loud and noisy and forcing him to open his mouth to breathe. He may have dyspnea on exertion, anemia, abnormal facial features— such as a short forehead; puffy, wide-set eyes (periorbital edema); wrinkled eyelids; and a broad, short, upturned nose—and a dull expression, resulting from mental retardation. His skin is cold and mottled because of poor circulation, and his hair is dry, brittle, and dull. Teeth erupt late and tend to decay early; body temperature is below normal; and pulse rate is slow. In the child who acquires hypothyroidism after age 2, appropriate treatment can prevent mental retardation. However, growth retardation becomes apparent in short stature (due to delayed epiphyseal maturation, particularly in the legs), obesity, and a head that appears P abnormally large because the arms and legs are stunted. An older child may show delayed or accelerated sexual development.\",\n",
              " 'Thyroiditis': \"Autoimmune thyroiditis is usually asymptomatic and commonly occurs in females, with peak incidence in middle age. It's the most prevalent cause of spontaneous hypothyroidism. In subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, moderate thyroid enlargement may follow an upper respiratory tract infection or a sore throat. The thyroid may be painful and tender, and dysphagia may occur. In Riedel's thyroiditis, the gland enlarges slowly as it's replaced by hard, fibrous tissues. This fibrosis may compress the trachea or the esophagus. The thyroid feels firm. Clinical effects of miscellaneous thyroiditis are characteristic of pyogenic infection: fever, pain, tenderness, and reddened skin over the gland.\",\n",
              " 'Simple goiter': \"Thyroid enlargement may range from a mildly enlarged gland to a massive, multinodular goiter. (See Massive goiter.) Because simple goiter doesn't alter the patient's metabolic state, clinical features arise solely from enlargement of the thyroid gland. The patient may complain of respiratory distress and dysphagia from compression of the trachea and esophagus, and swelling and distention of the neck. In addition, large goiters may obstruct venous return, produce venous engorgement and, in rare cases, induce development of collateral venous circulation in the chest. Obstruction may cause dizziness or syncope (Pemberton's sign) when the patient raises her arms above her head.\",\n",
              " 'Hyperthyroidism': 'The classic features of hyperthyroidism are an enlarged thyroid (goiter), nervousness, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, sweating, diarrhea, tremor, and palpitations. Exophthalmos is considered most characteristic but is absent in many patients with hyperthyroidism. Many other symptoms are common because hyperthyroidism profoundly affects virtually every body system. Central nervous system—difficulty in concentrating because increased T4 secretion accelerates cerebral function; excitability or nervousness due to increased basal metabolic rate; fine tremor, shaky handwriting, and clumsiness from increased activity in the spinal cord area that controls muscle tone; emotional instability and mood swings, ranging from occasional outbursts to overt psychosis Skin, hair, and nails—smooth, warm, flushed skin (patient sleeps with minimal covers and little clothing); fine, soft hair; premature graying and increased hair loss in both sexes; friable nails and onycholysis (distal nail separated from the bed); pretibial myxedema (dermopathy), producing thickened skin, accentuated hair follicles, raised red patches of skin that are itchy and sometimes painful, with occasional nodule formation (Microscopic examination shows increased mucin deposits.) P Cardiovascular system—tachycardia; full, bounding pulse; wide pulse pressure; cardiomegaly; increased cardiac output and blood volume; visible point of maximal impulse; paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (especially in the elderly); and occasionally, systolic murmur at the left sternal border Respiratory system—dyspnea on exertion and at rest, possibly from cardiac decompensation and increased cellular oxygen utilization GI system—possible anorexia; nausea and vomiting due to increased GI mobility and peristalsis; increased defecation; soft stools or, with severe disease, diarrhea; and liver enlargement Musculoskeletal system—weakness, fatigue, and muscle atrophy; rare coexistence with myasthenia gravis; generalized or localized paralysis associated with hypokalemia may occur; and occasional acropachy —soft-tissue swelling, accompanied by underlying bone changes where new bone formation occurs Reproductive system—in women, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, decreased fertility, higher incidence of spontaneous abortions; in men, gynecomastia due to increased estrogen levels; in both sexes, diminished libido Eyes—exophthalmos (from the combined effects of accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and fluids in the retroorbital tissues that force the eyeball outward, and of lid retraction that produces the characteristic staring gaze); occasional inflammation of conjunctivae, corneas, or eye muscles; diplopia; and increased tearing.',\n",
              " 'Hypoparathyroidism': \"Although mild hypoparathyroidism may be asymptomatic, it usually produces hypocalcemia and high serum phosphate levels that affect the P central nervous system (CNS) as well as other body systems. Chronic hypoparathyroidism typically causes neuromuscular irritability, increased deep tendon reflexes, Chvostek's sign (hyperirritability of the facial nerve, producing a characteristic spasm when it's tapped), dysphagia, organic mental syndrome, psychosis, mental deficiency in children, and tetany. Acute (overt) tetany begins with a tingling in the fingertips, around the mouth and, occasionally, in the feet. This tingling spreads and becomes more severe, producing muscle tension and spasms and consequent adduction of the thumbs, wrists, and elbows. Pain varies with the degree of muscle tension but seldom affects the face, legs, and feet. Chronic tetany is usually unilateral and less severe; it may cause difficulty in walking and a tendency to fall. Both forms of tetany can lead to laryngospasm, stridor and, eventually, cyanosis. They may also cause seizures. These CNS abnormalities tend to be exaggerated during hyperventilation, pregnancy, infection, withdrawal of thyroid hormone, therapy with loop diuretics, and before menstruation. Other clinical effects include abdominal pain; dry, lusterless hair; spontaneous hair loss; brittle fingernails that develop ridges or fall out; dry, scaly skin; cataracts; and weakened tooth enamel, which causes teeth to stain, crack, and decay easily. Hypocalcemia may induce cardiac arrhythmias and may eventually lead to heart failure.\",\n",
              " 'Hyperparathyroidism': 'Clinical effects of primary hyperparathyroidism result from hypercalcemia and are typically present in several body systems. Renal system—nephrocalcinosis due to elevated levels of calcium and, possibly, recurring nephrolithiasis, which may lead to renal insufficiency. Renal manifestations, including polyuria, are the most common effects of hyperparathyroidism. Skeletal and articular system—chronic low back pain and easy fracturing due to bone degeneration, bone tenderness, chondrocalcinosis, occasional severe osteopenia, especially on the vertebrae, erosions of the juxta-articular surface, subchondral fractures, traumatic synovitis, and pseudogout GI system—pancreatitis, causing constant, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back; peptic ulcers, causing abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting Neuromuscular system—marked muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the legs',\n",

              " 'Adrenal hypofunction': \"Adrenal hypofunction typically produces such effects as weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and various GI disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and chronic diarrhea. When primary, the disorder usually causes a conspicuous bronze coloration of the skin. The patient appears to be deeply suntanned, especially in the creases of the hands and over the metacarpophalangeal joints, the elbows, and the knees. He may also exhibit a darkening of scars, areas of vitiligo (absence of pigmentation), and increased pigmentation of the mucous membranes, especially the gingival mucosa. Abnormal skin and mucous membrane coloration results from decreased secretion of cortisol (one of the glucocorticoids), which causes the pituitary gland to simultaneously secrete excessive amounts of corticotropin and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Associated cardiovascular abnormalities in adrenal hypofunction include orthostatic hypotension, decreased cardiac size and output, and a weak, irregular pulse. Other clinical effects include decreased tolerance for even minor stress, poor coordination, fasting hypoglycemia (due to decreased gluconeogenesis), and a craving for salty food. Adrenal hypofunction may also retard axillary and pubic hair growth in females, decrease the libido (from decreased androgen production) and, in severe cases, cause amenorrhea. Secondary adrenal hypofunction produces similar clinical effects but without hyperpigmentation because corticotropin and MSH levels are low. Because aldosterone secretion may continue at fairly normal levels in secondary adrenal hypofunction, this condition doesn't necessarily cause accompanying hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities.\",\n",
              " \"Cushing's syndrome\": \"Like other endocrine disorders, Cushing's syndrome induces changes in multiple body systems, depending on the adrenocortical hormone involved. Clinical effects may include the following. Endocrine and metabolic systems—diabetes mellitus, with decreased glucose tolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, and glycosuria Musculoskeletal system—muscle weakness due to hypokalemia or to loss of muscle mass from increased catabolism, pathologic fractures due to decreased bone mineral, and skeletal growth retardation in children Skin—purplish striae; fat pads above the clavicles, over the upper back (buffalo hump), on the face (moon face), and throughout the trunk, with slender arms and legs; little or no scar formation; poor wound healing; acne and hirsutism in females GI system—peptic ulcer, resulting from increased gastric secretions and pepsin production, and decreased gastric mucus Central nervous system (CNS)—irritability and emotional lability, ranging from euphoric behavior to depression or psychosis; insomnia Cardiovascular system—hypertension due to sodium and water retention; left ventricular hypertrophy; capillary weakness due to protein loss, which leads to bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymosis\",\n",

Renal and urologic systems—sodium and secondary fluid retention, increased potassium excretion, inhibited antidiuretic hormone P secretion, ureteral calculi from increased bone demineralization with hypercalciuria Reproductive system—increased androgen production with clitoral hypertrophy, mild virilism, and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea in women. Sexual dysfunction also occurs.',\n",
              " 'Hyperaldosteronism': 'Most clinical effects of hyperaldosteronism result from hypokalemia, which increases neuromuscular irritability and produces muscle weakness; intermittent, flaccid paralysis; fatigue; headaches; paresthesia; and, possibly, tetany (resulting from metabolic alkalosis), which can lead to hypocalcemia. Diabetes mellitus is common, perhaps because hypokalemia interferes with normal insulin secretion. Hypertension and its accompanying complications are also common. Other characteristic findings include visual disturbances and loss of renal concentrating ability, resulting in nocturnal polyuria and polydipsia. Azotemia indicates chronic potassium depletion nephropathy.',\n",
              " 'Adrenogenital syndrome': 'The neonatal female with simple virilizing CAH has ambiguous genitalia (enlarged clitoris, with urethral opening at the base; some labioscrotal fusion) but normal genital tract and gonads. As she grows older, signs of progressive virilization develop: early appearance of pubic and axillary hair, deep voice, acne, and facial hair. The neonatal male with this condition has no obvious abnormality; however, at prepuberty he shows accentuated masculine characteristics, such as deepened voice and an enlarged phallus, with frequent erections. At puberty, females fail to begin menstruation, and males have small testes. Both males and females with this condition may be taller than other children their age as a result of rapid bone and muscle growth, but because excessive androgen levels hasten epiphyseal closure, abnormally short adult stature results.

Common clinical effects include palpitations, tachycardia, headache, diaphoresis, pallor, warmth or flushing, paresthesia, tremor, excitation, fright, nervousness, feelings of impending doom, abdominal pain, tachypnea, nausea, and vomiting. Orthostatic hypotension and paradoxical response to antihypertensive drugs are common, as are associated glycosuria, hyperglycemia, and hypermetabolism. Patients with hypermetabolism may show marked weight loss but some patients with pheochromocytomas are obese. Symptomatic episodes may recur as seldom as once every 2 months or as often as 25 times a day. They may occur spontaneously or may follow certain precipitating events, such as postural change, exercise, laughing, smoking, induction of anesthesia, urination, or a change in environmental or body temperature. Pheochromocytoma is commonly diagnosed during pregnancy, when uterine pressure on the tumor induces more frequent attacks; such attacks can prove fatal for both mother and fetus as a result of a stroke, acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, or hypoxia. In such patients, the risk of spontaneous abortion is high but most fetal deaths occur during labor or immediately after birth.',\n",
              " 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia': \"Clinical effects of MEN may develop in various combinations and orders, depending on the glands involved. The most common manifestation of MEN I is hyperparathyroidism, followed by ulcer due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (marked by increased gastrin production from non-beta islet cell tumors of the pancreas). Hypoglycemia may result from pancreatic beta islet cell tumors, with increased insulin production. When MEN I affects the parathyroids, it produces signs of hyperparathyroidism, including hypercalcemia (because the parathyroids are primarily responsible for the regulation of calcium and phosphorus levels). When MEN causes pituitary tumor, it's most commonly a prolactinoma, but can be a growth hormone or corticotropin, or even a nonsecretory adenoma. Characteristic features of MEN II with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid include enlarged thyroid mass, with resultant increased calcitonin and, occasionally, ectopic corticotropin, causing Cushing's syndrome. With tumors of the adrenal medulla, symptoms include headache, tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension; with adenomatosis or hyperplasia of the parathyroids, symptoms result from renal calculi.\",\n",
              " 'Diabetes mellitus': \"Diabetes may begin dramatically with ketoacidosis or insidiously. Its most common symptom is fatigue from energy deficiency and a catabolic state. Insulin deficiency causes hyperglycemia, which pulls fluid from body tissues, causing osmotic diuresis, polyuria, dehydration, polydipsia, dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor and, in most patients, unexplained weight loss.In ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, dehydration may cause hypovolemia and shock. Wasting of glucose in the urine usually produces weight loss and hunger in type 1 diabetes, even if the patient eats voraciously. (See Understanding ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar coma, pages 646 and 647.) Long-term effects of diabetes may include retinopathy, nephropathy, atherosclerosis, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy usually affects the hands and feet and may cause numbness or pain. Autonomic neuropathy may manifest itself in several ways, including gastroparesis (leading to delayed gastric emptying and a feeling of nausea and fullness after meals), nocturnal diarrhea, impotence, and orthostatic hypotension. Because hyperglycemia impairs the patient's resistance to infection, diabetes may result in skin and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and vaginitis. Glucose content of the epidermis and urine encourages bacterial growth.\",\n",
              " 'Blepharitis': 'Clinical features of blepharitis include itching, burning, foreign-body sensation, and sticky, crusted eyelids on waking. This constant irritation results in unconscious rubbing of the eyes (causing reddened rims) or continual blinking. Other signs include waxy scales in seborrheic blepharitis; and flaky scales on lashes, loss of lashes, and ulcerated areas on lid margins in ulcerative blepharitis. In association with KCS, dry eyes may also be a problem.',\n",
              " 'Exophthalmos': 'The obvious effect is a bulging eyeball, commonly with diplopia, if extraocular muscle edema causes misalignment. (See Recognizing exophthalmos.) A rim of the sclera may be visible below the upper lid as lid retraction occurs, and the patient may blink infrequently. Other symptoms depend on the cause: pain may accompany traumatic exophthalmos; a tumor may produce conjunctival hyperemia or chemosis; retraction of the upper lid predisposes to exposure keratitis. If exophthalmos is associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis, the patient may exhibit paresis of the muscles supplied by cranial nerves III, IV, and VI; limited ocular movement; and a septictype (high) fever.',\n",
              " 'Ptosis': \"An infant with congenital ptosis has a smooth, flat upper eyelid, without the eyelid fold normally caused by the pull of the levator muscle; associated weakness of the superior rectus muscle isn't uncommon. The child with unilateral ptosis that covers the pupil can develop an amblyopic eye from disuse or lack of eye stimulation. In bilateral ptosis, the child may elevate his brow in an attempt to compensate, wrinkling his forehead in an effort to raise the upper lid. Also, the child may tilt his head backward to see. In myasthenia gravis, ptosis results from fatigue and characteristically appears in the evening, but is relieved by rest. Ptosis due to oculomotor nerve damage produces a fixed, dilated pupil; divergent strabismus; and slight depression of the eyeball.\",\n",
              " 'Orbital cellulitis': 'Orbital cellulitis generally produces unilateral eyelid edema, hyperemia of the orbital tissues, reddened eyelids, and matted lashes. Although the eyeball is initially unaffected, proptosis develops later (because of edematous tissues within the bony confines of the orbit). Other indications include extreme orbital pain, impaired eye movement, chemosis, and purulent discharge from indurated areas. The severity of associated systemic symptoms (chills, fever, and malaise) varies according to the cause. Complications include posterior extension, causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, panophthalmitis, meningitis, or brain abscess and, rarely, atrophy and subsequent loss of vision secondary to optic neuritis.',\n",
              " 'Dacryocystitis': 'Dacryocystitis is extremely painful for the patient. The hallmark of both the acute and chronic forms of dacryocystitis is constant tearing. Other symptoms of dacryocystitis include inflammation and tenderness over the nasolacrimal sac; pressure over this area may fail to produce purulent discharge from the punctum.',\n",
              " 'Chalazion': \"A chalazion occurs as a painless, hard lump that usually points toward the conjunctival side of the eyelid. Eversion of the lid reveals a red or red-yellow elevated area on the conjunctival surface. Otherwise, it's seen as an indurated bump under the skin of the upper eyelid.\",\n",
              " 'Stye': 'Typically, a stye produces redness, swelling, and pain. An abscess frequently forms at the lid margin, with an eyelash pointing outward from its center. A stye is a localized red, swollen, and tender abscess of the lid glands.',\n",
              " 'Inclusion conjunctivitis': \"Inclusion conjunctivitis develops 5 to 12 days after contamination (it takes longer to develop than gonococcal ophthalmia). In a neonate, reddened eyelids and tearing with moderate mucoid discharge are presenting symptoms. In neonates, pseudomembranes may form, which can lead to conjunctival scarring. In adults, follicles appear inside the lower eyelids; such follicles don't form in infants because the lymphoid tissue isn't yet well developed. Children and adults also develop preauricular lymphadenopathy, and children may develop otitis media as a complication. Inclusion conjunctivitis may persist for weeks or months, possibly with superficial corneal involvement.\",\n",
              " 'Conjunctivitis': \"Conjunctivitis commonly produces hyperemia of the conjunctiva, sometimes accompanied by discharge, tearing and, with corneal involvement, pain and photophobia. It generally doesn't affect vision. Conjunctivitis usually begins in one eye and rapidly spreads to the other by contamination of towels, washcloths, or the patient's own hand. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) usually lasts only 2 weeks. The patient typically complains of itching, burning, and the sensation of a foreign body in his eye. The eyelids show a crust of sticky, mucopurulent discharge. If the disorder is due to N. gonorrhoeae, however, the patient exhibits a profuse, purulent discharge. Viral conjunctivitis produces copious tearing with minimal exudate, and enlargement of the preauricular lymph node. Some viruses follow a chronic course and produce severe disabling disease; others last 2 to 3 weeks and are self-limiting.Itching is the hallmark of allergy. Giant papillae resembling cobblestones may be seen on the palpebral conjunctiva\",\n",
              " 'Trachoma': 'Trachoma begins with a mild infection resembling bacterial conjunctivitis (visible conjunctival follicles, red and edematous eyelids, pain, photophobia, tearing, and exudation). After about 1 month, if the infection is untreated, conjunctival follicles enlarge into inflamed papillae that later become yellow or gray. At this stage, small blood vessels invade the cornea under the upper lid.Eventually, severe scarring and contraction of the eyelids cause entropion; the eyelids turn inward and the lashes rub against the cornea, producing corneal scarring and visual distortion. In late stages, severe conjunctival scarring may obstruct the lacrimal ducts and cause dry eyes.',\n",
              " 'Keratitis': 'Keratitis is usually unilateral. The patient presents with decreased vision, discomfort ranging from mild irritation to acute pain, tearing, and photophobia. On gross examination with a penlight, the corneal light reflex may appear distorted. When keratitis results from exposure, it usually affects the lower portion of the cornea.',\n",
              " 'Corneal abrasion': 'A corneal abrasion typically produces redness, increased tearing, discomfort with blinking, a sensation of “something in the eye” and, because the cornea is richly endowed with nerve endings from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), pain disproportionate to the size of the injury. It may also affect visual acuity, depending on the size and location of the injury.',\n",
              " 'Corneal ulcers': 'Typically, corneal ulceration begins with pain (aggravated by blinking) and photophobia, followed by increased tearing. Eventually, central corneal ulceration produces pronounced visual blurring. The eye may appear injected. If a bacterial ulcer is present, purulent discharge is possible.',\n",
              " 'Uveitis': 'Anterior uveitis produces moderate to severe unilateral eye pain; severe ciliary injection; photophobia; tearing; a small, nonre-active pupil; and blurred vision (due to the increased number of cells in the aqueous humor). It sometimes produces deposits called keratic precipitates on the back of the cornea, which may be seen in the anterior chamber. The iris may adhere to the lens, causing posterior synechiae and pupillary distortion; pain and photophobia may occur. Onset may be acute or insidious. Posterior uveitis begins insidiously, with complaints of slightly decreased or blurred vision or floating spots. Posterior uveitis may be acute or chronic, and it may affect one or both eyes. Retinal damage caused by lesions from toxoplasmosis and retinal detachments may occur. Refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for dilated fundus examination and treatment for local systemic diseases',\n",
              " 'Retinal detachment': 'Initially, the patient may complain of floating spots and recurrent flashes of light (photopsia). However, as detachment progresses, gradual, painless vision loss may be described as a veil, curtain, or cobweb that eliminates a portion of the visual field.',\n",
              " 'Vascular retinopathies': 'Central retinal artery occlusion produces sudden, painless, unilateral loss of vision (partial or complete). It may follow amaurosis fugax or transient episodes of unilateral loss of vision lasting from a few seconds to minutes, probably due to vasospasm. This condition typically causes permanent blindness. However, some patients experience spontaneous resolution within hours and regain partial vision. Central retinal vein occlusion causes reduced visual acuity, allowing perception of only hand movement and light. This condition is painless, except when it results in secondary neovascular glaucoma (uncontrolled proliferation of weak blood vessels). The prognosis is poor—some patients with this condition develop secondary glaucoma within 3 to 4 months after occlusion. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy produces changes in the lining of the retinal blood vessels that cause the vessels to leak plasma or fatty substances, which decrease or block blood flow (nonperfusion) within the retina. This disorder may also produce microaneurysms and small hemorrhages. Nonproliferative retinopathy causes no symptoms in some patients; in others, leakage of fluid into the macular region causes significant loss of central visual acuity (necessary for reading and driving) and diminished night vision.',\n",
              " 'Age-related macular degeneration': 'The patient notices a change in central vision. Initially, straight lines (for example, of buildings) become distorted; later, a blank area appears in the center of a printed page (central scotoma).',\n",
              " 'Cataract': 'Characteristically, a patient with a cataract experiences painless, gradual blurring and loss of vision. As the cataract progresses, the normally black pupil appears hazy, and when a mature cataract develops, the white lens may be seen through the pupil. Some patients complain of blinding glare from headlights when they drive at night; others complain of poor reading vision, and of an unpleasant glare and poor vision in bright sunlight. Patients with central opacities report better vision in dim light than in bright light because the cataract is nuclear and, as the pupils dilate, patients can see around the lens opacity.',\n",
              " 'Retinitis pigmentosa': 'Typically, night blindness occurs while the patient is in his teens. As the disease progresses, his visual field gradually constricts, causing tunnel or “gun-barrel” vision. Many people retain this tunnel of useful vision until quite late in life. The speed of vision loss varies considerably from person to person. However, blindness follows invasion of the macular region.',\n",
              " 'Optic atrophy': 'Optic atrophy causes abrupt or gradual painless loss of visual field or visual acuity, with subtle changes in color vision.',\n",
              " 'Extraocular motor nerve palsies': \"The most characteristic clinical effect of extraocular motor nerve palsies is diplopia of recent onset, which varies in different visual fields, depending on the muscles affected. Typically, the patient with third nerve palsy exhibits ptosis, exotropia (eye looks outward), pupil dilation, and unresponsiveness to light; the eye is unable to move and can't accommodate. The patient with fourth nerve palsy displays diplopia and an inability to rotate the eye downward or upward. The head is tilted to the side opposite the involved area in superior oblique palsy. Sixth nerve palsy causes one eye to turn; the eye can't abduct beyond the midline. To compensate for diplopia, the patient turns his head to the unaffected side and can develop torticollis.\",\n",
              " 'Glaucoma': \"Chronic open-angle glaucoma is usually bilateral, with insidious onset and a slowly progressive course. Symptoms appear late in the disease and include mild aching in the eyes, loss of peripheral vision, seeing halos around lights, and reduced visual acuity (especially at night) that isn't correctable with glasses. Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically has a rapid onset, constituting an ophthalmic emergency. Symptoms include acute pain in a unilaterally inflamed eye, with pressure over the eye, moderate pupil dilation that's nonreactive to light, a cloudy cornea, blurring and decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and seeing halos around lights. Increased IOP may induce nausea and vomiting, which may cause glaucoma to be misinterpreted as GI distress. Unless treated promptly, this acute form of glaucoma produces blindness in 3 to 5 days.\",\n",
              " 'Otitis externa': \"Acute otitis externa characteristically produces moderate to severe pain that's exacerbated by manipulating the auricle or tragus, clenching the teeth, opening the mouth, or chewing. Its other clinical effects may include fever, foul-smelling discharge, crusting in the external ear, regional cellulitis, partial hearing loss, and itching. It's usually difficult to view the tympanic membrane because of pain in the external canal.Hearing acuity is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred.Fungal otitis externa may be asymptomatic, although A. niger produces a black or gray, blotting, paperlike growth in the ear canal. In chronic otitis externa, pruritus replaces pain, and scratching may lead to scaling and skin thickening. Aural discharge may also occur.\",\n",
              " 'Benign tumors of the ear canal': 'A benign ear tumor is usually asymptomatic, unless it becomes infected, in which case pain, fever, or inflammation may result. (Pain is usually a sign of a malignant tumor.) If the tumor grows large enough to obstruct the ear canal by itself or through accumulated cerumen and debris, it may cause hearing loss and the sensation of pressure.',\n",
              " 'Otitis media': 'Clinical features of acute suppurative otitis media include severe, deep, throbbing pain (from pressure behind the tympanic membrane); signs of upper respiratory tract infection (sneezing or coughing); mild to very high fever; hearing loss (usually mild and conductive); tinnitus; dizziness; nausea; and vomiting. Other possible effects include bulging of the tympanic membrane, with concomitant erythema, and purulent drainage in the ear canal from tympanic membrane rupture. However, many patients are asymptomatic.Acute secretory otitis media produces a severe conductive hearing loss—which varies from 15 to 35 dB, depending on the thickness and amountof fluid in the middle ear cavity—and, possibly, a sensation of fullness in the ear and popping, crackling, or clicking sounds on swallowing or with jaw movement. Accumulation of fluid may also cause the patient to hear an echo when he speaks and to experience a vague feeling of top-heaviness.The cumulative effects of chronic otitis media include thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic membrane mobility, cholesteatoma (a cystlike mass in the middle ear) and, in chronic suppurative otitis media, a painless, purulent discharge.The extent of associated conductive hearing loss varies with the size and type of tympanic membrane perforation and ossicular destruction. If the tympanic membrane has ruptured, the patient may state that the pain has suddenly stopped. Complications may include abscesses (brain, subperiosteal, and epidural), sigmoid sinus or jugular vein thrombosis,septicemia, meningitis, suppurative labyrinthitis, facial paralysis, andotitis externa.',\n",
              " 'Mastoiditis': 'Primary clinical features include a dull ache and tenderness in the area of the mastoid process, low- grade fever, headache, and a thick, purulent discharge that gradually becomes more profuse, possibly leading to otitis externa. Postauricular erythema and edema may push the auricle out from the head; pressure within the edematous mastoid antrum may produce swelling and obstruction of the external ear canal, causing conductive hearing loss.',\n",
              " 'Otosclerosis': 'Spongy bone in the otic capsule immobilizes the footplate of the normally mobile stapes, disrupting the conduction of vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This causes progressive unilateral hearing loss, which may advance to bilateral deafness. Other symptoms include tinnitus and paracusis of Willis (hearing conversation better in a noisy environment than in a quiet one).',\n",
              " 'Infectious myringitis': 'Acute infectious myringitis begins with severe ear pain, commonly accompanied by tenderness over the mastoid process. Small, reddened, inflamed blebs form in the canal, on the tympanic membrane and, with bacterial invasion, in the middle ear. Fever and hearing loss are rare unless fluid accumulates in the middle ear, or a large bleb totally obstructs the external auditory meatus. Spontaneous rupture of these blebs may cause bloody discharge. Chronic granular myringitis produces pruritus, purulent discharge, and gradual hearing loss.',\n",
              " \"Ménière's disease\": \"Ménière's disease produces three characteristic effects: severe episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss. A feeling of fullness or blockage in the ear is also common. Violent paroxysmal attacks last from 10 minutes to several hours. During an acute attack, other symptoms include severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, giddiness, and nystagmus. Vertigo may cause loss of balance and falling to the affected side. Symptoms tend to wax and wane as the endolymphatic pressure rises and falls. To lessen these symptoms, the patient may assume a characteristic posture—lying on the side of the unaffected ear and looking in the direction of the affected ear. Initially, the patient may be asymptomatic between attacks, except for residual tinnitus that worsens during an attack. Such attacks may occur several times a year, or remissions may last as long as several years. These attacks become less frequent as hearing loss progresses (usually unilaterally); they may cease when hearing loss is total. All symptoms are aggravated by motion.\",\n",
              " 'Labyrinthitis': 'Because the inner ear controls both hearing and balance, this infection typically produces severe vertigo (with any movement of the head) and sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo begins gradually but peaks within 48 hours, causing loss of balance and falling in the direction of the affected ear. Other associated signs and symptoms include spontaneous nystagmus, with jerking movements of the eyes toward the unaffected ear, and nausea, vomiting, and giddiness. With cholesteatoma, signs of middle ear disease may appear. With severe bacterial infection, purulent drainage, increased salivation, generalized malaise, and perspiration can occur. To minimize symptoms such as giddiness and nystagmus, the patient may assume a characteristic posture —lying on the side of the unaffected ear and looking in the direction of the affected ear.',\n",
              " 'Hearing loss': 'Sudden deafness may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed, depending on etiology. Associated clinical features depend on the underlying cause. Noise-induced hearing loss causes sensorineural damage, the extent of which depends on the duration and intensity of the noise. Initially, the patient loses perception of certain frequencies (around 4,000 Hz) but, with continued exposure, eventually loses perception of all frequencies.',\n",
              " 'Motion sickness': 'Typically, motion sickness induces nausea, vomiting, headache,dizziness, fatigue, diaphoresis and, occasionally, difficulty in breathing,leading to a sensation of suffocation. These symptoms usually subside when the precipitating stimulus is removed, but they may persist for several hours or days.',\n",
              " 'Epistaxis': \"Blood oozing from the nostrils usually originates in the anterior nose and is bright red. Blood from the back of the throat originates in the posterior area and may be dark or bright red (commonly mistaken for hemoptysis due to expectoration). Epistaxis is generally unilateral, except when it's due to dyscrasia or severe trauma. In severe epistaxis, blood may seep behind the nasal septum; it may also appear in the middle ear and in the corners of the eyes. Associated clinical effects depend on the severity of bleeding. Moderate blood loss may produce light-headedness, dizziness, and slight respiratory difficulty; severe hemorrhage causes hypotension, rapid and bounding pulse, dyspnea, and pallor. Bleeding is considered severe if it persists longer than 10 minutes after pressure is applied and causes blood loss as great as 1 L/hour in adults. Exsanguination (bleeding to death) from epistaxis is rare.\",\n",
              " 'Septal perforation and deviation': 'A small septal perforation is usually asymptomatic but may produce a whistle on inspiration. A large perforation causes rhinitis, epistaxis, nasal crusting, and watery discharge.The patient with a deviated septum may develop a crooked nose, as the midline deflects to one side. The predominant symptom of severe deflection, however, is nasal obstruction. Other manifestations include a sensation of fullness in the face, shortness of breath, stertor (snoring or laborious breathing), nasal discharge, recurring epistaxis, infection, sinusitis, and headache.',\n",
              " 'Sinusitis': 'The primary indication of acute sinusitis is nasal congestion, followed by a gradual buildup of pressure in the affected sinus. For 24 to 48 hours after onset, nasal discharge may be present and later may become purulent. Associated symptoms include malaise, sore throat, headache,and low-grade fever of 99° to 99.5° F [37.2° to 37.5° C]).Characteristic pain depends on the affected sinus: maxillary sinusitis causes pain over the cheeks and upper teeth; ethmoid sinusitis, pain over the eyes; frontal sinusitis, pain over the eyebrows; and sphenoid sinusitis (rare), pain behind the eyes. (See Locating the paranasal sinuses.) Purulent nasal drainage that continues for longer than 3 weeks after an acute infection subsides suggests subacute sinusitis. Other clinical features of the subacute form include nasal congestion, vague facial discomfort, fatigue, and a nonproductive cough. The effects of chronic sinusitis are similar to those of acute sinusitis, but the chronic form causes continuous mucopurulent discharge.',\n",
              " 'Nasal polyps': 'Nasal obstruction is the primary indication of nasal polyps. Such obstruction causes anosmia, a sensation of fullness in the face, nasal discharge, headache, and shortness of breath. Associated clinical features are usually the same as those of allergic rhinitis.',\n",
              " 'Nasal papillomas': 'Both inverted and exophytic papillomas typically produce symptoms related to unilateral nasal obstruction—congestion, postnasal drip,headache, shortness of breath, dyspnea and, rarely, severe respiratory distress, nasal drainage, and infection. Epistaxis is most likely to occur with exophytic papillomas. Occasionally hemorrhage may be the presenting symptom.',\n",
              " 'Adenoid hyperplasia': 'Typically, adenoid hyperplasia produces symptoms of respiratory obstruction, especially mouth breathing, snoring at night, and frequent, prolonged nasal congestion. Persistent mouth breathing during the formative years produces voice alteration and distinctive changes in facial features—a slightly elongated face, open mouth, highly arched palate, shortened upper lip, and vacant expression.',\n",
              " 'Velopharyngeal insufficiency': 'Generally, this condition causes unintelligible speech, marked by hypernasality, nasal emission, poor consonant definition, and a weak voice. The patient experiences dysphagia and, if velopharyngeal insufficiency is severe, he may regurgitate through the nose.',\n",
              " 'Pharyngitis': 'Pharyngitis produces a sore throat and slight difficulty in swallowing. Swallowing saliva is usually more painful than swallowing food. Pharyngitis may also cause the sensation of a lump in the throat as well as a constant, aggravating urge to swallow. Associated features may include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, coryza, and rhinorrhea. Uncomplicated pharyngitis usually subsides in 3 to 10 days.',\n",
              " 'Tonsillitis': 'Acute tonsillitis commonly begins with a mild to severe sore throat. A very young child, unable to describe a sore throat, may stop eating.Tonsillitis may also produce dysphagia, fever, swelling and tenderness of the lymph glands in the submandibular area, muscle and joint pain, chills, malaise, headache, and pain (frequently referred to the ears).Excess secretions may elicit the complaint of a constant urge to swallow; the back of the throat may feel constricted. Such discomfort usually subsides after 72 hours. Chronic tonsillitis produces a recurrent sore throat and purulent drainage in the tonsillar crypts. Frequent attacks of acute tonsillitis may also occur. Complications include obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy and peritonsillar abscess.',\n",
              " 'Throat abscesses': 'Key symptoms of peritonsillar abscess include severe throat pain,occasional ear pain on the same side as the abscess, and tenderness of the submandibular gland. Dysphagia causes drooling. Trismus may occur as a result of the spread of edema and infection from the peritonsillar space to the pterygoid muscles. Other effects include fever, chills,malaise, rancid breath, nausea, muffled speech, dehydration, cervical adenopathy, and localized or systemic sepsis. Clinical features of retropharyngeal abscess include pain, dysphagia, fever and, when the abscess is located in the upper pharynx, nasal obstruction; with a lowpositioned abscess, dyspnea, progressive inspiratory stridor (from laryngeal obstruction), neck hyperextension and, in children, drooling and muffled crying occur. Other symptoms in children may include gurgling respirations, dyspnea and dysphagia, respiratory symptoms, and fever. A very large abscess may press on the larynx, causing edema, or may erode into major vessels, causing sudden death from asphyxia or aspiration.',\n",
              " 'Vocal cord paralysis': 'Unilateral paralysis, the most common form, may cause vocal weakness and hoarseness. Bilateral paralysis typically produces vocal weakness and incapacitating airway obstruction if the cords become paralyzed in the adducted position.',\n",

              " 'Juvenile angiofibroma': 'Juvenile angiofibroma produces unilateral or bilateral nasal obstruction and severe recurrent epistaxis, usually between ages 7 and 21. Recurrent epistaxis eventually causes secondary anemia. Associated effects include purulent rhinorrhea, facial deformity, and nasal speech. Serous otitis media and hearing loss may result from eustachian tube obstruction.',\n",
              " 'Impetigo': 'Common nonbullous impetigo typically begins with a small red macule that turns into a vesicle or pustule. When the vesicle breaks, a thick yellow crust forms from the exudate. (See Recognizing impetigo, page 736.) Autoinoculation may cause satellite lesions. Although it can occur anywhere, impetigo usually occurs around the mouth and nose and on the knees and elbows. Other features include pruritus, burning, and regional lymphadenopathy.

Deep folliculitis may be painful. Folliculitis may progress to the hard, painful nodules of furunculosis, which commonly develop on the neck, face, axillae, and buttocks. For several days these nodules enlarge, and then rupture, discharging pus and necrotic material. After the nodules rupture, pain subsides, but erythema and edema may persist for days or weeks. Carbunculosis is marked by extremely painful, deep abscesses that drain through multiple openings onto the skin surface, usually around several hair follicles. Fever and malaise may accompany these lesions.',\n",
              " 'Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome': \"SSSS can usually be traced to a prodromal upper respiratory tract infection, possibly with concomitant purulent conjunctivitis. Cutaneous changes progress through three stages: Erythema: Erythema, which may begin diffusely or as a scarlatiniform rash, usually becomes visible around the mouth and other orifices and may spread in widening circles over the entire body surface. The skin becomes tender; Nikolsky's sign (sloughing of the skin when friction is applied) may appear. Exfoliation (24 to 48 hours later): In the more common, localized form of this disease, superficial erosions with a red, moist base and minimal crusting occur, generally around body orifices, and may spread to exposed areas of the skin. (See Identifying staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, page 740.) In the more severe forms of this disease, large, flaccid bullae erupt and may spread to cover extensive areas of the body. These bullae eventually rupture, revealing sections of denuded skin; mucous membranes are spared. Desquamation: In this final stage, affected areas dry up, and powdery scales form. Normal skin replaces these scales in 5 to 7 days.\",\n",

These lesions are usually tawny but may range from hypopigmented (white) patches in dark- skinned patients to hyperpigmented (brown) patches in fair-skinned patients. Some areas don't tan when exposed to sunlight, causing the cosmetic defect for which most people seek medical help. Inflammation, burning, and itching are possible but usually absent.\",\n",

Tinea capitis ranges in appearance from broken-off hairs with little scaling to severe painful, inflammatory, pus-filled masses (kerions) covering the entire scalp. Partial hair loss occurs in all cases. The cardinal clue is broken-off hairs. Tinea corporis produces flat lesions on the skin at any site except the scalp, bearded skin, hands, or feet. These lesions may be dry and scaly or moist and crusty; as they enlarge, their centers heal, causing the classic ring-shaped appearance. In tinea unguium (onychomycosis), infection typically starts at the tip of one or more toenails (fingernail infection is less common) and produces gradual thickening, discoloration, and crumbling of the nail, with accumulation of subungual debris. Eventually, the nail may be destroyed completely. Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, causes scaling and blisters between the toes. Severe infection may result in inflammation, with severe itching and pain on walking. A dry, squamous inflammation may affect the entire sole. (See Athlete's foot.) Tinea manuum produces scaling patches and hyperkeratosis on the palmar surface. It's usually unilateral and associated with tinea pedis. Tinea cruris (jock itch) produces red, raised, sharply defined, itchy or burning lesions in the groin that may extend to the buttocks, inner thighs, and the external genitalia. Warm weather, obesity, and tight clothing encourage fungus growth. Tinea barbae is an uncommon infection that affects the bearded facial area of men.\",\n",
              " 'Scabies': 'Typically, scabies causes itching, which intensifies at night. Characteristic lesions are usually excoriated and may appear as erythematous nodules. These threadlike lesions are approximately 1 cm long and generally occur between fingers, on flexor surfaces of the wrists, on elbows, in axillary folds, at the waistline, on nipples and buttocks in females, and on genitalia in males.',\n",
              " 'Cutaneous larva migrans': \"A transient rash, tingling, or, possibly, a small vesicle appears at the point of penetration, usually on an exposed area that has come in contact with the ground, such as the feet, legs, or buttocks. The incubation period is typically 1 to 6 days. The parasite may be active almost as soon as it enters the skin. Local pruritus begins within hours following penetration. As the parasite migrates, it etches a noticeable thin, raised, red line on the skin, which may become vesicular and encrusted. Pruritus quickly develops, often with crusting and secondary infection following excoriation. Onset is usually characterized by slight itching that develops into intermittent stinging pain as the thin, red lines develop. The larva's apparently random path can cover from 1 mm to 1 cm a day. Penetration of more than one larva may involve a much larger area of the skin, marking it with many tracks.\",\n",
              " 'Pediculosis': 'Clinical features of pediculosis capitis include itching; excoriation (with severe itching); matted, foul- smelling, lusterless hair (in severe cases); occipital and cervical lymphadenopathy (posterior cervical lymphadenopathy without obvious disease is characteristic); and a rash on the trunk, probably due to sensitization. Adult lice migrate from the scalp and deposit oval, gray-white nits on the proximal one- third of hair shafts. Pediculosis corporis initially produces small, red papules (usually on the shoulders, trunk, or buttocks). Later, wheals (probably a sensitivity reaction) may develop. Untreated pediculosis corporis may lead to vertical excoriations and ultimately to dry, discolored, thickly encrusted, scaly skin, with bacterial infection and scarring. In severe cases, headache, fever, and malaise may accompany cutaneous symptoms. Pediculosis pubis causes skin irritation from scratching, which is usually more obvious than the bites. Small gray-blue spots (maculae caeruleae) may appear on the thighs or upper body. Small red spots are often seen in the underclothing.',\n",
              " 'Acne vulgaris': \"The acne plug may appear as a closed comedo, or whitehead (if it doesn't protrude from the follicle and is covered by the epidermis), or as an open comedo, or blackhead (if it does protrude and isn't covered by the epidermis). The black coloration is caused by the melanin or pigment of the follicle. Rupture or leakage of an enlarged plug into the dermis produces inflammation and characteristic acne pustules, papules or, in severe forms, acne cysts or abscesses.\",\n",
              " 'Hirsutism': \"Hirsutism typically produces enlarged hair follicles as well as enlargement and hyperpigmentation of the hairs themselves. Excessive facial hair growth is the complaint for which most patients seek medical help. Generally, hirsutism involves appearance of thick, pigmented hair in the beard area, upper back, shoulders, sternum, axillae, and pubic area. Frontotemporal scalp hair recession is often a coexisting condition. Patterns of hirsutism vary widely, depending on the patient's race and age. ELDER TIP Elderly women commonly show increased hair growth on the chin and upper lip. In secondary hirsutism, signs of masculinization may appear—eepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, increased size of genitalia, menstrual irregularity, and decreased breast size\",\n",
              " 'Alopecia': \"In male-pattern alopecia, hair loss is gradual and usually affects the thinner, shorter, and less pigmented hairs of the frontal and parietal portions of the scalp. In women, hair loss is generally more diffuse; completely bald areas are uncommon but may occur. Alopecia areata affects small patches of the scalp but may also occur as alopecia totalis, which involves the entire scalp and eyebrows, or as alopecia universalis, which involves the entire body. Although mild erythema may occur initially, affected areas of scalp or skin appear normal. “Exclamation point” hairs (loose hairs with dark, rough, brushlike tips on narrow, less pigmented shafts) occur at the periphery of new patches. Regrowth hairs are thin and may be white or gray. They're usually replaced by normal hair. In trichotillomania, patchy, incomplete areas of hair loss with many broken hairs appear on the scalp but may occur on other areas such as the eyebrows.\",\n",
              " 'Rosacea': \"Rosacea generally begins with periodic flushing across the central oval of the face, accompanied later by telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and nodules. Rhinophyma is commonly associated with severe untreated rosacea but may occur alone. Rhinophyma usually appears first on the lower half of the nose, and produces red, thickened skin and follicular enlargement. It's found almost exclusively in men older than age 40. Related ocular lesions are uncommon.\",\n",
              " 'Vitiligo': 'Vitiligo produces depigmented or stark-white patches on the skin; on fair \\x02skinned whites, these are almost imperceptible. Lesions are usually bilaterally symmetrical with sharp borders, which occasionally are hyperpigmented. Lesions that are small initially can enlarge and even progress to total depigmentation (universal vitiligo). These unique patches generally appear over bony prominences on the back of the hands; on the face, the axillae, genitalia, nipples, or umbilicus; around orifices (such as the eyes, mouth, and anus); within P body folds; and at sites of trauma. The hair within these lesions may also turn white. Because hair follicles and certain parts of the eyes also contain pigment cells, vitiligo may be associated with premature gray hair and ocular pigmentary changes.',\n",
              " 'Melasma': 'Typically, melasma produces large, brown, irregular patches, symmetrically distributed on the forehead, cheeks, and sides of the nose. Less commonly, these patches may occur on the neck, upper lip, temples and, occasionally, on the dorsa of the forearms.',\n",
              " 'Photosensitivity reactions': 'Immediately after sun exposure, a phototoxic reaction causes a burning sensation followed by erythema (sunburn-type reaction), edema, desquamation, and hyperpigmentation. Berlock dermatitis produces an acute reaction with erythematous vesicles that later become hyperpigmented. Photoallergic reactions may take one of two forms. Developing 2 hours to 5 days after light exposure, polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) produces erythema, papules, vesicles, urticaria, and eczematous lesions on exposed areas; pruritus may persist for 1 to 2 weeks. Solar urticaria begins minutes after exposure and lasts about an hour; erythema and wheals follow itching and burning sensations.',\n",
              " 'Dermatitis': \"Atopic skin lesions generally begin as erythematous areas on excessively dry skin. PEDIATRIC TIP In children, lesions typically appear on the forehead, cheeks, and extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. In adults, lesions appear at flexion points (antecubital fossa, popliteal area, and neck). During flare- ups, pruritus and scratching cause edema, crusting, and scaling. Eventually, chronic atopic lesions lead to multiple areas of dry, scaly skin, with white dermatographia, blanching, and lichenification. Common secondary conditions associated with atopic dermatitis include viral, fungal, or bacterial infections, and ocular disorders. Because of intense pruritus, the upper eyelid is commonly hyperpigmented and swollen, and a double fold occurs under the lower lid (Morgan-Dennie folds, Morgan folds, Dennie pleats, or Mongolian lines). Atopic cataracts are unusual but may develop between ages 20 and 40. Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, a potentially fatal, generalized viral infection, may develop if the patient with atopic dermatitis comes in contact with a person who's infected with herpes simplex.\",\n",
              " 'Toxic epidermal necrolysis': 'Early symptoms include inflammation of the mucous membranes, a burning sensation in the conjunctivae, malaise, fever, and generalized skin tenderness. After such prodromal symptoms, TEN erupts in three phases: diffuse, erythematous rash vesiculation and blistering large-scale epidermal necrolysis and desquamation. Large, flaccid bullae that rupture easily expose extensive areas of denuded skin, permitting both loss of tissue fluids and electrolytes and widespread systemic involvement.',\n",
              " 'Warts': 'Clinical manifestations depend on the type of wart and its location: common (verruca vulgaris): rough, elevated, rounded surface; appears most frequently on extremities, particularly hands and fingers; most prevalent in children and young adults condyloma acuminatum (moist wart or genital wart): usually small, pink to red, moist, and soft; may occur singly or in large cauliflower-like clusters on the penis, scrotum, vulva, cervix, vagina, and anus; can also occur on oral mucosa following oral-genital exposure; considered a sexually transmitted disease digitate: fingerlike, horny projection arising from a pea-shaped base; occurs on scalp or near hairline filiform: single, thin, threadlike projection; commonly occurs around the face and neck P flat (also known as juvenile or verruca plana): multiple groupings of up to several hundred slightly raised lesions with smooth, flat, or slightly rounded tops; common on the face, neck, chest, knees, dorsa of hands, wrists, and flexor surfaces of the forearms; usually occur in children but can affect adults; often linear distribution because of spread from scratching or shaving periungual: rough, irregularly shaped, elevated surface; occurs around edges of fingernails and toenails; when severe, may extend under nail and lift it off nail bed, causing pain plantar: slightly elevated or flat; occur singly or in large clusters (mosaic warts), primarily at pressure points of feet.',\n",
              " 'Psoriasis': \"The most common complaint of the patient with psoriasis is itching and, occasionally, pain from dry, cracked, encrusted lesions. Psoriatic lesions are erythematous and usually form well-defined plaques, sometimes covering large areas of the body. (See Psoriatic plaques.) Such lesions most commonly appear on the scalp, chest, elbows, knees, shins, back, and buttocks. The plaques consist of characteristic silver scales that either flake off easily or can thicken, covering the lesion. Removal of psoriatic scales frequently produces fine bleeding points (Auspitz sign). Occasionally, small guttate lesions appear, either alone or with plaques; these lesions are typically thin and erythematous, with few scales. Widespread shedding of scales is common in exfoliative or erythrodermic psoriasis and may also develop in chronic psoriasis. Rarely, psoriasis becomes pustular, taking one of two forms. In localized pustular (Barber's) psoriasis, pustules appear on the palms and soles and remain sterile until opened. In generalized pustular (von Zumbusch's) psoriasis, which often occurs with fever, leukocytosis, and malaise, groups of pustules coalesce to form lakes of pus on red skin. These pustules also remain sterile until opened and commonly involve the tongue and oral mucosa. In about 30% of patients, psoriasis spreads to the fingernails, producing small indentations and yellow or brown discoloration. In severe cases, the accumulation of thick, crumbly debris under the nail, causes it to separate from the nail bed. Some patients with psoriasis develop arthritic symptoms (psoriatic arthritis), usually in one or more joints of the fingers or toes, or sometimes in the sacroiliac joints, which may progress to spondylitis. Such patients may complain of morning stiffness. Joint symptoms show no consistent linkage to the course of the cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis; they demonstrate remissions and exacerbations similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n",
              " 'Lichen planus': \"Lichen planus may develop suddenly or insidiously. Initial lesions commonly appear on the arms or legs (generally on the wrist and medial sides of the thighs) and evolve into the generalized eruption of flat, glistening, purple papules marked with white lines or spots (Wickham's striae). These lesions may be linear from scratching or may coalesce into plaques. Lesions often affect the mucous membranes (especially the buccal mucosa), male genitalia and, less often, the nails. These lesions are painful, especially when ulcers develop. Mild to severe pruritus is common.\",\n",
              " 'Corns and calluses': \"Both corns and calluses cause pain through pressure placed on underlying tissue by localized thickened skin. Corns contain a central keratinous core, are smaller and more clearly defined than calluses, and are usually more painful. The pain they cause may be dull and constant or sharp when pressure is applied. “Soft” corns are caused by the pressure of a bony prominence. They appear as whitish thickenings and are commonly found between the toes, most often in the fourth interdigital web. “Hard” corns are sharply delineated and conical, and appear most frequently over the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth toe. Calluses have indefinite borders and may be quite large. They usually produce dull pain on pressure, rather than constant pain. Although calluses commonly appear over plantar warts, they're distinguished from these warts by normal skin markings.\",\n",
              " 'Pityriasis rosea': \"Pityriasis typically begins with an erythematous “herald” patch, which may appear anywhere on the body, although it occurs most commonly on the trunk. Although this slightly raised, oval lesion is about 2 to 6 cm in diameter, approximately 25% of patients don't notice it. A few days to several weeks later, yellow-tan or erythematous patches with scaly edges (about 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter) erupt on the trunk and extremities—and, rarely, on the face, hands, and feet in adolescents. Eruption continues for 7 to 10 days, and the patches persist for 2 to 6 weeks. Occasionally, these patches are macular, vesicular, or urticarial. A characteristic of this disease is the arrangement of lesions, which produces a pattern similar to that of a pine tree. Accompanying pruritus, if present, is usually mild but may be severe.\",\n",
              " 'Hyperhidrosis': \"Axillary hyperhidrosis frequently produces such extreme sweating that patients often ruin their clothes in 1 day and develop contact dermatitis from clothing dyes; similarly, hyperhidrosis of the soles can easily damage a pair of shoes. Profuse sweating from both the soles and palms hinders the patient's ability to work and interact socially. Patients with this condition often report increased emotional strain.\",\n",
              " 'Pressure ulcers': \"Pressure ulcers commonly develop over bony prominences. Early features of superficial lesions are shiny, erythematous changes over the compressed area, caused by localized vasodilation when pressure is relieved. Superficial erythema progresses to small blisters or erosions and, ultimately, to necrosis and ulceration. An inflamed area on the skin's surface may be the first sign of underlying damage when pressure is exerted between deep tissue and bone. Bacteria in a compressed site cause inflammation and, eventually, infection, which leads to further necrosis. A foul-smelling, purulent discharge may seep from a lesion that penetrates the skin from beneath. Infected, necrotic tissue prevents healthy granulation of scar tissue; a black eschar may develop around and over the lesion.\",\n",

              " 'Pituitary tumors': \"As pituitary adenomas grow, they replace normal glandular tissue and enlarge the sella turcica, which houses the pituitary gland. The resulting pressure on adjacent intracranial structures produces these typical clinical manifestations: Neurologic: frontal headache visual symptoms, beginning with blurring and progressing to field cuts (hemianopsias) and then unilateral blindness P cranial nerve involvement (III, IV, VI) from lateral extension of the tumor, resulting in strabismus; double vision, with compensating head tilting and dizziness; conjugate deviation of gaze; nystagmus; lid ptosis; and limited eye movements increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (secondary hydrocephalus) personality changes or dementia, if the tumor breaks through to the frontal lobes seizures rhinorrhea, if the tumor erodes the base of the skull pituitary apoplexy secondary to hemorrhagic infarction of the adenoma. Such hemorrhage may lead to both cardiovascular and adrenocortical collapse. Endocrine: hypopituitarism, to some degree, in all patients with adenoma, becoming more obvious as the tumor replaces normal gland tissue (signs and symptoms include amenorrhea, decreased libido and impotence in men, skin changes [waxy appearance, decreased wrinkles, and pigmentation], loss of axillary and pubic hair, lethargy, weakness, increased fatigability, intolerance to cold, and constipation [because of decreased corticotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone production]) addisonian crisis, precipitated by stress and resulting in nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and circulatory collapse diabetes insipidus, resulting from extension to the hypothalamus prolactin- secreting adenomas (in 70% to 75%), with amenorrhea and galactorrhea GH-secreting adenomas, with acromegaly corticotropin-secreting adenomas, with Cushing's syndrome.\",\n",
              " 'Laryngeal cancer': \"In intrinsic laryngeal cancer, the dominant and earliest symptom is hoarseness that persists longer than 3 weeks; in extrinsic cancer, it's a lump in the throat or pain or burning in the throat when drinking citrus juice or hot liquid. Later clinical effects of metastasis include dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and pain radiating to the ear.\",\n",
              " 'Thyroid cancer': 'The primary sign of thyroid cancer is a painless nodule, a hard nodule in an enlarged thyroid gland, or palpable lymph nodes with thyroid enlargement. Eventually, the pressure of such a nodule or enlargement causes hoarseness, dysphagia, dyspnea, and pain on palpation. If the tumor is large enough to destroy the gland, hypothyroidism follows, with its typical symptoms of low metabolism (mental apathy and sensitivity to cold). However, if the tumor stimulates excess thyroid hormone production, it induces symptoms of hyperthyroidism (sensitivity to heat, restlessness, and hyperactivity). Other clinical features include diarrhea, anorexia, irritability, vocal cord paralysis, and symptoms of distant metastasis.',\n",
              " 'Malignant spinal neoplasms': \"Extramedullary tumors produce symptoms by pressing on nerve roots, the spinal cord, and spinal vessels; intramedullary tumors, by destroying the parenchyma and compressing adjacent areas. Because intramedullary tumors may extend over several spinal cord segments, their symptoms are more variable than those of extramedullary tumors. The following clinical effects are likely with all malignant spinal cord neoplasms: Pain—Most severe directly over the tumor, radiates around the trunk or down the limb on the affected side and is unrelieved by bed rest. It may worsen when lying down or with straining, coughing, or sneezing. Pain can be diffuse, occurring over all extremities. Generally, it progressively worsens and isn't relieved by medication. Motor symptoms—Asymmetric spastic muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone, exaggerated reflexes, and a positive Babinski's sign. If the tumor is at the level of the cauda equina, muscle flaccidity, muscle wasting, weakness, and progressive diminution in tendon reflexes are characteristic. Sensory deficits—Contralateral loss of pain, temperature, and touch sensation (Brown- Séquard's syndrome). These losses are less obvious to the patient than functional motor changes. Caudal lesions invariably produce paresthesia in the nerve distribution pathway of the involved roots. Bowel and bladder symptoms—Urine retention is an inevitable late sign with cord compression. Early signs include incomplete emptying or difficulty with the urine stream, which is usually unnoticed or ignored. Cauda equina tumors cause bladder and bowel incontinence due to flaccid paralysis.\",\n",
              " 'Lung cancer': \"Because early-stage lung cancer usually produces no symptoms, this disease is usually in an advanced state at diagnosis. These late-stage symptoms commonly lead to diagnosis: Epidermoid and small cell carcinomas —smoker's cough, hoarseness, wheezing, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain Adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma —fever, weakness, weight loss, anorexia, and shoulder pain. In addition to their obvious interference with respiratory function, lung tumors may also alter the production of hormones that regulate body function or homeostasis. Clinical conditions that result from such changes are known as hormonal paraneoplastic syndromes: Gynecomastia may result from large cell carcinoma. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (bone and joint pain from cartilage erosion due to abnormal production of growth hormone) may result from large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cushing's and carcinoid syndromes may result from small cell carcinoma. Hypercalcemia may result from epidermoid tumors. Metastatic signs and symptoms vary greatly, depending on the effect of tumors on intrathoracic and distant structures: bronchial obstruction: hemoptysis, atelectasis, pneumonitis, dyspnea cervical thoracic sympathetic nerve involvement: miosis, ptosis, exophthalmos, reduced sweating chest wall invasion: piercing chest pain, increasing dyspnea, severe shoulder pain, radiating down arm esophageal compression: dysphagia local lymphatic spread: cough, hemoptysis, stridor, pleural effusion pericardial involvement: pericardial effusion, tamponade, arrhythmias P phrenic nerve involvement: dyspnea, shoulder pain, unilateral paralyzed diaphragm, with paradoxical motion recurrent nerve invasion: hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis vena caval obstruction: venous distention and edema of face, neck, chest, and back.

              " 'Gastric cancer': 'Early clues to gastric cancer are chronic dyspepsia and epigastric discomfort, followed in later stages by weight loss, anorexia, feeling of fullness after eating, anemia, and fatigue. If the cancer is in the cardia, the first sign or symptom may be dysphagia and, later, vomiting (commonly coffeeground vomitus). Affected patients may also have blood in their stools. The course of gastric cancer may be insidious or fulminating. Unfortunately, the patient typically treats himself with antacids or histamine blockers until the symptoms of advanced stages appear.',\n",

Other generalized effects include fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, weakness, indigestion, clay-colored stools, paleness, depression, skin lesions (usually on the legs), and fatigue.',\n",
              " 'Colorectal cancer': \"Signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer result from local obstruction and, in later stages, from direct extension to adjacent organs (bladder, prostate, ureters, vagina, sacrum) and distant metastasis (usually liver). In the early stages, signs and symptoms are typically vague and depend on the anatomic location and function of the bowel segment containing the tumor. Later signs or symptoms usually include pallor, cachexia, ascites, hepatomegaly, or lymphangiectasis. ELDER TIP Older patients may ignore bowel symptoms, believing that they result from constipation, poor diet, or hemorrhoids. Evaluate your older patient's responses to your questions carefully. On the right side of the colon (which absorbs water and electrolytes), early tumor growth causes no signs of obstruction because the tumor tends to grow along the bowel rather than surround the lumen, and the fecal content in this area is normally liquid. It may, however, cause black, tarry stools; anemia; and abdominal aching, pressure, or dull cramps. As the disease progresses, the patient develops weakness, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, vertigo and, eventually, diarrhea, obstipation, anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, and other signs or symptoms of intestinal obstruction. In addition, a tumor on the right side may be palpable. On the left side, a tumor causes signs of an obstruction even in early stages because in this area stools are of a formed consistency. It commonly causes rectal bleeding (in many cases ascribed to hemorrhoids), intermittent abdominal fullness or cramping, and rectal pressure. As the disease progresses, the patient develops obstipation, P diarrhea, or “ribbon” or pencil-shaped stools. Typically, he notices that passage of stools or flatus relieves the pain. At this stage, bleeding from the colon becomes obvious, with dark or bright red blood in the feces and mucus in or on the stools. With a rectal tumor, the first symptom is a change in bowel habits, in many cases beginning with an urgent need to defecate on arising (morning diarrhea) or obstipation alternating with diarrhea. Other signs are blood or mucus in stools and a sense of incomplete evacuation. Late in the disease, pain begins as a feeling of rectal fullness that later becomes a dull, and sometimes constant, ache confined to the rectum or sacral region.\",\n",
              " 'Kidney cancer': 'Kidney cancer produces a classic clinical triad (hematuria, pain, and a palpable mass), but any one may be the first sign of cancer. Microscopic or gross hematuria (which may be intermittent) suggests that the cancer has spread to the renal pelvis. Constant abdominal or flank pain may be dull or, if the cancer causes bleeding or blood clots, acute and colicky. The mass is generally smooth, firm, and nontender. All three signs coexist in only about 10% of patients. Other signs include fever (perhaps from hemorrhage or necrosis), hypertension (from compression of the renal artery with renal parenchymal ischemia), rapidly progressing hypercalcemia (possibly from ectopic parathyroid hormone production by the tumor), and urine retention. Weight loss, edema in the legs, nausea, and vomiting signal advanced disease.',\n",

              " 'Bladder cancer': 'In early stages, about 25% of patients with bladder tumors have no symptoms. Commonly, the first sign is gross, painless, intermittent hematuria (in many cases with clots in the urine). Many patients with invasive lesions have suprapubic pain after voiding. Other signs and symptoms include bladder irritability, urinary frequency, nocturia, and dribbling.',\n",
              " 'Gallbladder and bile duct cancer': 'Clinically, gallbladder cancer is almost indistinguishable from cholecystitis—pain in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. However, chronic, progressively severe pain in an afebrile patient suggests malignancy. In patients with simple gallstones, pain is sporadic. Another telling clue to malignancy is palpable gallbladder (right upper quadrant), with obstructive jaundice. Some patients may also have hepatosplenomegaly. Progressive profound jaundice is commonly the first sign of obstruction due to extrahepatic bile duct cancer. The jaundice is usually accompanied by chronic pain in the epigastrium or the right upper quadrant, radiating to the back. Other common signs or symptoms, if associated with active cholecystitis, include pruritus, skin excoriations, anorexia, weight loss, chills, and fever.',\n",
              " 'Prostate cancer': 'Signs and symptoms of prostate cancer appear only in the advanced stages and include difficulty initiating a urine stream, dribbling, urine retention, unexplained cystitis and, rarely, hematuria.

              " 'Uterine cancer': \"Uterine enlargement, and persistent and unusual premenopausal bleeding, or any postmenopausal bleeding, are the most common indications of uterine cancer. The discharge may at first be watery and bloodstreaked, but it gradually becomes more bloody. Other signs or symptoms, such as pain and weight loss, don't appear until the cancer is well advanced.\",\n",
              " 'Vaginal cancer': 'Commonly, the patient with vaginal cancer has experienced abnormal bleeding and discharge. Also, she may have a small or large, in many cases firm, ulcerated lesion in any part of the vagina. As the cancer progresses, it commonly spreads to the bladder (producing frequent voiding and bladder pain), the rectum (bleeding), vulva (lesion), pubic bone (pain), or other surrounding tissues.',\n",
              " 'Ovarian cancer': 'Typically, symptoms vary with the size of the tumor. An ovary may grow to considerable size before it produces overt symptoms. Occasionally, in the early stages, ovarian cancer causes vague abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and other mild GI disturbances. As it progresses, it causes urinary frequency, constipation, pelvic discomfort, distention, and weight loss. Tumor rupture, torsion, or infection may cause pain, which, in young patients, may mimic appendicitis. Granulosa cell tumors have feminizing effects (such as bleeding between periods in premenopausal women); conversely, arrhenoblastomas have virilizing effects. Advanced ovarian cancer causes ascites, rarely postmenopausal bleeding and pain, and symptoms relating to metastatic sites (most commonly pleural effusions).',\n",
              " 'Cancer of the vulva': \"In 50% of patients, cancer of the vulva begins with vulval pruritus, bleeding, or a small vulval mass (which may start as a small ulcer on the surface; eventually, it becomes infected and painful), so such symptoms call for immediate diagnostic evaluation. Seventy percent of lesions develop on the labia, but tumors can be found on the clitoris, Bartholin's P glands, and perineum. Less common indications include a mass in the groin or abnormal urination or defecation.\",\n",
              " 'Fallopian tube cancer': 'Generally, early stage fallopian tube cancer produces no symptoms. Late-stage disease is characterized by an enlarged abdomen with a palpable mass, amber-colored vaginal discharge, excessive bleeding during menstruation or, at other times, abdominal cramps, frequent urination, bladder pressure, persistent constipation, weight loss, and unilateral colicky pain produced by hydrops tubae profluens. (This last symptom occurs when the abdominal end of the fallopian tube closes, causing the tube to become greatly distended until its accumulated P secretions suddenly overflow into the uterus.) Metastasis develops by local extension or by lymphatic spread to the abdominal organs or to the pelvic, aortic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Extra-abdominal metastasis is rare.',\n",
              " 'Primary malignant bone tumors': \"Bone pain is the most common indication of primary malignant bone tumors. It's generally more intense at night; isn't usually associated with mobility. The pain is dull and usually localized, although it may be referred from the hip or spine and result in weakness or a limp. Another common sign is a mass or tumor. The tumor site may be tender and may swell; the tumor itself is often palpable. Pathologic fractures are common. In late stages, patient may be cachectic, with fever and impaired mobility.\",\n",
              " 'Multiple myeloma': 'The earliest indication of multiple myeloma is severe, constant back and rib pain that increases with exercise and may be worse at night. Arthritic symptoms may also occur: achiness, joint swelling, and tenderness, possibly from vertebral compression. Other effects include fatigue, fever, malaise, slight evidence of peripheral neuropathy (such as peripheral paresthesia), and pathologic fractures. As multiple myeloma progresses, symptoms of vertebral compression may become acute, accompanied by anemia, weight loss, thoracic deformities (ballooning), and loss of body height (5″ [12.7 cm] or more) due to vertebral collapse. Renal complications such as pyelonephritis (caused by tubular damage from large amounts of Bence Jones protein, hypercalcemia, and hyperuricemia) may occur. Severe, recurrent infection such as pneumonia may follow damage to nerves associated with respiratory function.',\n",
              " 'Basal cell epithelioma': \"Three types of basal cell epithelioma occur: Noduloulcerative lesions usually occur on the face, particularly the forehead, eyelid margins, and nasolabial folds. In early stages, these lesions are small, smooth, pinkish, and translucent papules. Telangiectatic vessels cross the surface, and the lesions are occasionally pigmented. As the lesions enlarge, their centers become depressed and their borders become firm and elevated. Ulceration P and local invasion eventually occur. These ulcerated tumors, known as rodent ulcers, rarely metastasize; however, if untreated, they can spread to vital areas and become infected or cause massive hemorrhage if they invade large blood vessels. Superficial basal cell epitheliomas are multiple in many cases and commonly occur on the chest and back. They're oval or irregularly shaped, lightly pigmented plaques, with sharply defined, slightly elevated threadlike borders. Due to superficial erosion, these lesions appear scaly and have small, atrophic areas in the center that resemble psoriasis or eczema. They're usually chronic and don't tend to invade other areas. Superficial basal cell epitheliomas are related to ingestion of or exposure to arsenic-containing compounds. Sclerosing basal cell epitheliomas (morphea-like epitheliomas) are waxy, sclerotic, yellow to white plaques without distinct borders. Occurring on the head and neck, sclerosing basal cell epitheliomas commonly look like small patches of scleroderma.\",\n",
              " 'Squamous cell carcinoma': 'Squamous cell carcinoma commonly develops on the skin of the face, the ears, the dorsa of the hands and forearms, and other sun-damaged areas. Lesions on sun-damaged skin tend to be less invasive and less likely to metastasize than lesions on unexposed skin. Notable exceptions to this tendency are squamous cell lesions on the lower lip and the ears. P These are almost invariably markedly invasive metastatic lesions with a generally poor prognosis. Transformation from a premalignant lesion to squamous cell carcinoma may begin with induration and inflammation of the preexisting lesion. When squamous cell carcinoma arises from normal skin, the nodule grows slowly on a firm, indurated base. If untreated, this nodule eventually ulcerates and invades underlying tissues. (See Staging squamous cell carcinoma, page 874.) Metastasis can occur to the regional lymph nodes, producing characteristic systemic symptoms of pain, malaise, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia.',\n",
              " 'Malignant melanoma': \"Common sites for melanoma are on the head and neck in men, on the legs in women, and on the backs of persons exposed to excessive sunlight. Up to 70% arise from a preexisting nevus. It rarely appears in the conjunctiva, choroid, pharynx, mouth, vagina, or anus. Suspect melanoma when any skin lesion or nevus enlarges, changes color, becomes inflamed or sore, itches, ulcerates, bleeds, undergoes textural changes, or shows signs of surrounding pigment regression (halo nevus or vitiligo). (See Recognizing potentially malignant nevi, page 876.) Each type of melanoma has special characteristics: Superficial spreading melanoma, the most common, usually develops between ages 40 and 50. Such a lesion arises on an area of chronic irritation. In women, it's most common between the knees and ankles; in Blacks and Asians, on the toe webs and soles (lightly pigmented areas subject to trauma). Characteristically, this melanoma has a red, white, and blue color over a brown or black background and an irregular, notched margin. Its surface is irregular, with small, elevated tumor nodules that may ulcerate and bleed. Horizontal growth may continue for many years; when vertical growth begins, prognosis worsens. Nodular melanoma usually develops between ages 40 and 50, grows vertically, invades the dermis, and metastasizes early. Such a lesion is usually a polypoidal nodule, with uniformly dark discoloration (it may be grayish), and looks like a blackberry. Occasionally, this melanoma is fleshcolored, with flecks of pigment around its base (possibly inflamed). Lentigo maligna melanoma is relatively rare. It arises from a lentigo maligna on an exposed skin surface and usually occurs between ages 60 and 70. This lesion looks like a large (3- to 6-cm) flat freckle of tan, brown, black, whitish, or slate color and has irregularly scattered black nodules on the surface. It develops slowly, usually over P many years, and eventually may ulcerate. This melanoma commonly develops under the fingernails, on the face, and on the back of the hands.\",\n",
              " \"Kaposi's sarcoma\": \"The initial sign of Kaposi's sarcoma is one or more obvious lesions in various shapes, sizes, and colors (ranging from red-brown to dark purple) appearing most commonly on the skin, buccal mucosa, hard and soft palates, lips, gums, tongue, tonsils, conjunctiva, and sclera. In advanced disease, the lesions may join, becoming one large plaque. Untreated lesions may appear as large, ulcerative masses. Other signs and symptoms include: health history of AIDS pain (if the sarcoma advances beyond the early stages or if a lesion breaks down or impinges on nerves or organs) edema from lymphatic obstruction dyspnea (in cases of pulmonary involvement), wheezing, hypoventilation, and respiratory distress from bronchial blockage. The most common extracutaneous sites are the lungs and GI tract (esophagus, oropharynx, and epiglottis). Signs and symptoms of disease progression and metastasis include severe pulmonary involvement and GI involvement leading to digestive problems.\",\n",
              " \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\": \"The first sign of Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of one of the cervical lymph nodes (but sometimes the axillary, mediastinal, or inguinal lymph nodes), occasionally in a patient who gives a history of recent upper respiratory infection. In older patients, the first signs and symptoms may be nonspecific—persistent fever, night sweats, fatigue, P weight loss, and malaise. Rarely, if the mediastinum is initially involved, Hodgkin's lymphoma may produce respiratory symptoms. Another early and characteristic indication of Hodgkin's lymphoma is pruritus, which, although mild at first, becomes acute as the disease progresses. Other symptoms depend on the degree and location of systemic involvement. Lymph nodes may enlarge rapidly, producing pain and obstruction, or enlarge slowly and painlessly for months or years. It isn't unusual to see the lymph nodes “wax and wane,” but they usually don't return to normal. Sooner or later, most patients develop systemic manifestations, including enlargement of retroperitoneal nodes and nodular infiltrations of the spleen, the liver, and bones. At this late stage other symptoms include edema of the face and neck, progressive anemia, possible jaundice, nerve pain, and increased susceptibility to infection.\",\n",
              " \"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\": \"Usually, the first indication of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is swelling of the lymph glands, enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and painless, rubbery nodes in the cervical supraclavicular areas. In children, these nodes are usually in the cervical region, and the disease causes dyspnea and coughing. As the lymphoma progresses, the patient develops symptoms specific to the area involved and systemic complaints of fatigue, malaise, weight loss, fever, and night sweats.\",\n",
              " 'Mycosis fungoides': 'The first sign of MF may be generalized erythroderma, possibly associated with itching. Eventually, MF evolves into varied combinations of infiltrated, thickened, or scaly patches, tumors, or ulcerations.',\n",
              " 'Acute leukemia': 'Signs of acute leukemia may be gradual or abrupt; they include high fever accompanied by thrombocytopenia and abnormal bleeding (such as nosebleeds), gingival bleeding, purpura, ecchymoses, petechiae, easy bruising after minor trauma, and prolonged menses. Nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as low-grade fever, weakness, and lassitude, may persist for days or months before visible symptoms appear. Other insidious signs and symptoms include pallor, chills, and recurrent infections. In addition, ALL, AML, and acute monoblastic leukemia may cause dyspnea, anemia, fatigue, malaise, tachycardia, palpitations, systolic ejection murmur, and abdominal or bone pain. Specific AML symptoms include local infections (laryngitis, pharyngitis, meningitis) or septicemia. Joint arthralgias and abdominal fullness (from enlarged spleen) may occur. Specific ALL symptoms include night sweats, shortness of breath, anorexia, weight loss, kepatosplenomegaly, and lymph adenopathy. When leukemic cells cross the blood-brain barrier and thereby escape the effects of systemic chemotherapy, the patient may develop meningeal leukemia (confusion, lethargy, headache).',\n",
              " 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia': 'Typically, during the chronic phase, CML induces the following clinical effects: anemia (fatigue, weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, pallor, dyspnea, tachycardia, and headache) thrombocytopenia, with resulting bleeding and clotting disorders (retinal hemorrhage, ecchymoses, hematuria, melena, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and easy bruising) hepatosplenomegaly, with abdominal discomfort and pain in splenic infarction from leukemic cell infiltration. Other signs and symptoms include sternal and rib tenderness from leukemic infiltrations of the periosteum; low-grade fever; weight loss; anorexia; renal calculi or gouty arthritis from increased uric acid excretion; occasionally, prolonged infection and ankle edema; and, rarely, priapism and vascular insufficiency. Acceleration of the disease process results in fever, night sweats, splenomegaly, and bone pain.',\n",
              " 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia': \"CLL is the most benign and the most slowly progressive form of leukemia. Clinical signs derive from the infiltration of leukemic cells in bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and organ systems. In early stages, patients usually complain of fatigue, malaise, fever, and nodal enlargement. They're particularly susceptible to infection. In advanced stages, patients may experience severe fatigue and weight loss, with liver or spleen enlargement, bone tenderness, and edema from lymph node obstruction. Pulmonary infiltrates may appear when lung parenchyma is involved. Skin infiltrations, manifested by macular to nodular eruptions, occur in about one-half of the cases of CLL. As the disease progresses, bone marrow involvement may lead to anemia, pallor, weakness, dyspnea, tachycardia, palpitations, bleeding, and infection. Opportunistic fungal, viral, and bacterial infections commonly occur in late stages\",\n",
              " 'Neurofibromatosis': \"Signs and symptoms of NF-1 vary greatly from one family to another and within members of the same family. A patient who initially seems to have mild symptoms may develop more severe problems later. An infant with this form may present with only café-au-lait spots or may also have congenital glaucoma, plexiform neurofibromas, or pseudoarthrosis. About 90% of patients have Lisch nodules on the iris; as many as 15% develop optic pathway gliomas, which may cause a significant loss of vision. Cutaneous and other neurofibromas may begin to develop or become more prominent at puberty; pregnancy may exacerbate tumor growth. Some tumors become malignant; about 8% of patients develop neurofibrosarcoma (cancer of the nerve sheath). Other less-specific features may include other types of tumors (such as meningiomas), short stature, seizures, speech and learning disabilities, mental retardation (occasionally), and abnormalities of the cerebral, GI, and renal arteries. The first sign of NF-2 is usually a central nervous system tumor, such as a spinal or intracranial meningioma, an acoustic neuroma, and occasionally a schwannoma or spinal astrocytoma. Cutaneous neurofibromas may be less conspicuous in this form, and café-au-lait spots may be minimal or even absent. Learning disabilities and other less-specific features characteristic of NF-1 aren't typically seen in NF-2.\",\n",
              " 'Osteogenesis imperfecta': \"Clinical severity varies, depending on the type. In type I, fractures characteristically occur from minimal trauma. The sclerae are a deep blue-black color, and the teeth may be yellow or even grayish blue from opalescent dentin. Patients with dental abnormalities are shorter and have more fractures at birth, more frequent fractures, and more severe skeletal deformities than type I patients with normal teeth. Bowing of the lower limbs is common in this type, as is kyphosis in adults. About 40% of all adults with type I have severely impaired hearing, and virtually all adults have some degree of hearing impairment by age 50. The number of fractures may spontaneously decrease in adolescence. Type II is characterized by intrauterine fractures due to extreme bone fragility, leading to intrauterine or early infant death. Death usually results from complications of bone fragility, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or respiratory failure. Therapeutic intervention doesn't usually increase survival. Type III is generally nonlethal. Fractures are usually present at birth and occur frequently in childhood; they typically lead to progressive skeletal deformity and, eventually, impaired mobility. Patients have a poor growth rate; most fall below the third percentile in height for their age. Their sclerae are usually normal or light blue, and their teeth aren't usually opalescent. Type IV is characterized by osteoporosis, which leads to increased bone fragility. The sclerae may be light blue at birth but appear normal in adolescents and adults. Bowed limbs may be present at birth, but only 25% of patients have fractures at birth. The number of fractures may decrease spontaneously at puberty, but the majority of patients are short. A few have a skull deformity.\",\n",
              " 'Marfan syndrome': \"The most common signs and symptoms of this disorder are skeletal abnormalities, particularly excessively long tubular bones and an arm span that exceeds the patient's height. The patient is usually taller than average for his family (in the 95th percentile for his age), with the upper half of his body shorter than average and the lower half, longer. His fingers are long and slender (arachnodactyly). Weakness of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules results in joints that are loose, hyperextensible, and habitually dislocated. Excessive growth of the rib bones gives rise to chest deformities such as pectus excavatum (funnel chest). Eye problems are also common; 75% of patients have crystalline lens displacement (ectopia lentis), the ocular hallmark of Marfan syndrome. Quivering of the iris with eye movement (iridodonesis) typically suggests this disorder. Most patients are severely myopic, many have retinal detachment, and some have glaucoma. The most serious complications occur in the cardiovascular system and include weakness of the aortic media, which leads to progressive dilation or dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Such dilation appears first in the coronary sinuses and is commonly preceded by aortic insufficiency. Less-common cardiovascular complications include mitral valve prolapse and endocarditis. Other associated problems include sparsity of subcutaneous fat, frequent hernias, cystic lung disease, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and scoliosis or kyphosis.\",\n",
              " \"Stickler's syndrome\": \"The clinical phenotype can consist of ocular, auditory, craniofacial, and skeletal abnormalities. The number of organ systems involved and the specific phenotypic features expressed can vary significantly between affected family members and, in particular, between unrelated affected persons. Ocular symptoms, particularly high myopia, are common in persons with Stickler's syndrome, with the exception of those who have COLIJA2 mutations. Vitreal abnormalities are considered a hallmark of Stickler's syndrome, although the abnormalities in the vitreous differ in persons with a COL2AI mutation from those with a COLIIAI mutation. Retinal detachment resulting in blindness is the most serious ocular complication. The vitreoretinal degeneration that leads to retinal detachment is much more common in persons with a COL2AI mutation. Persons with Stickler's syndrome can also have congenital cataracts and develop glaucoma. Ocular symptoms are typically absent in persons with linkage to COLIJA2. Auditory symptoms include conductive hearing loss secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunction in children with cleft palate or collagen defects in the inner ear apparatus. Sensorineural hearing loss has an earlier onset and tends to be more progressive in persons with a COLIJAI mutation. Craniofacial features may include micrognathia (small lower jaw) and a flattened midface and nasal bridge. Micrognathia may be associated with some degree of cleft palate (bifid uvula to complete cleft of the palate). Micrognathia associated with glossoptosis places neonates and infants with Stickler's syndrome at significant risk for episodic obstructive apnea during feeding and when lying flat. Skeletal symptoms can include joint hypermobility in young children, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and, later, degenerative arthropathy during early adult years. Also related to the collagen defect, scoliosis and mitral valve prolapse can develop in some persons with Stickler's syndrome.\",\n",
              " 'Cystic fibrosis': \"The clinical effects of cystic fibrosis may become apparent soon after birth or may take years to develop. They include major aberrations in sweat gland, respiratory, and GI function. Sweat gland dysfunction is the most consistent abnormality. Increased concentrations of sodium and chloride in the sweat lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremia and can eventually induce fatal shock and arrhythmias, especially in hot weather. Respiratory symptoms reflect obstructive changes in the lungs: wheezy respirations; a dry, nonproductive paroxysmal cough; dyspnea; and tachypnea. These changes stem from thick, tenacious secretions in the bronchioles and alveoli and eventually lead to severe atelectasis and emphysema. Children with cystic fibrosis display a barrel chest, cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers and toes. They suffer recurring bronchitis and pneumonia as well as associated nasal polyps and sinusitis. Death typically results from pneumonia, emphysema, or atelectasis. The GI effects of cystic fibrosis occur mainly in the intestines, pancreas, and liver. One early symptom is meconium ileus; the neonate with cystic fibrosis doesn't excrete meconium, a dark green mucilaginous material found in the intestine at birth. He develops symptoms of intestinal obstruction, such as abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. As the child gets older, obstruction of the pancreatic ducts and resulting deficiency of trypsin, amylase, and lipase prevent the conversion and absorption of fat and protein in the GI tract. The undigested food is then excreted in frequent, bulky, foul-smelling, pale stools with a high fat content. This malabsorption induces poor weight gain, poor growth, ravenous appetite, distended abdomen, thin extremities, and sallow skin with poor turgor. The inability to absorb fats results in a deficiency of fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), leading to clotting problems, retarded bone growth, and delayed sexual development. Males may experience azoospermia and sterility; females may experience secondary amenorrhea but can reproduce. A common complication in infants and children is rectal prolapse secondary to malnutrition and wasting of perirectal supporting tissues. In the pancreas, fibrotic tissue, multiple cysts, thick mucus, and eventually fat replace the acini (small, saclike swellings normally found in this gland), producing symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency: insufficient insulin production, abnormal glucose tolerance, and glycosuria. About 15% of patients have adequate pancreatic exocrine function for normal digestion and, therefore, have a better prognosis. Biliary obstruction and fibrosis may prolong neonatal jaundice. In some patients, cirrhosis and portal hypertension may lead to esophageal varices, episodes of hematemesis and, occasionally, hepatomegaly.\",\n",
              " 'Tay-Sachs disease': \"A neonate with classic Tay-Sachs disease appears normal at birth, although he may have an exaggerated Moro reflex. By age 3 to 6 months, he becomes apathetic and responds only to loud sounds. His neck, trunk, arm, and leg muscles grow weaker, and soon he can't sit up or lift his head. He has difficulty turning over, can't grasp objects, and has progressive vision loss. By age 18 months, the infant is usually deaf and blind and has seizures, generalized paralysis, and spasticity. His pupils are dilated and don't react to light. Decerebrate rigidity and a vegetative state follow. The child suffers recurrent bronchopneumonia after age 2 and usually dies before age 5. A child who survives may develop ataxia and progressive motor retardation between ages 2 and 8. The “ juvenile” form of Tay-Sachs disease generally appears between ages 2 and 5 as a progressive deterioration of psychomotor skills and gait. Patients with this type can survive to adulthood.\",\n",
              " 'Phenylketonuria': 'An infant with undiagnosed and untreated PKU appears normal at birth but by 4 months begins to show signs of arrested brain development, including mental retardation and, later, personality disturbances (schizoid and antisocial personality patterns and uncontrollable temper). Such a child may have a lighter complexion than unaffected siblings and typically has blue eyes. He may also have microcephaly; eczematous skin lesions or dry, rough skin; and a musty (mousy) odor due to skin and urinary excretion of phenylacetic acid. About 80% of these children have abnormal EEG patterns, and about one-third have seizures, usually beginning between ages 6 and 12 months. Children with PKU show a precipitous decrease in IQ in their first year, are usually hyperactive and irritable, and exhibit purposeless, repetitive motions. They have increased muscle tone and an awkward gait. Although blood phenylalanine levels are near normal at birth, they begin to rise within a few days. By the time they reach significant levels (about 30 mg/dl), cerebral damage has begun. Such irreversible damage probably is complete by age 2 or 3. However, early detection and treatment can minimize cerebral damage, and children under strict dietary control can lead normal lives.',\n",
              " 'Albinism': \"Light-skinned Whites with tyrosinase-negative albinism have pale skin and hair color ranging from white to yellow; their pupils appear red because of translucent irides. Blacks with the same disorder have hair that may be white, faintly tinged with yellow, or yellow-brown. Both Whites and Blacks with tyrosinase-positive albinism grow darker as they age. For instance, their hair may become straw-colored or light brown and their skin cream-colored or pink. People with tyrosinase-positive albinism may also have freckles and pigmented nevi that may require excision. In tyrosinase-variable albinism, at birth the child's hair is white, his skin is pink, and his eyes are gray. As he grows older, though, his hair becomes yellow, his irides may become darker, and his skin may even tan slightly. The skin of a person with albinism is easily damaged by the sun. It may look weather-beaten and is highly susceptible to precancerous and cancerous growths. The patient may also have photophobia, myopia, strabismus, and congenital horizontal nystagmus.\",\n",
              " 'Sickle cell anemia': \"Characteristically, sickle cell anemia produces tachycardia, cardiomegaly, systolic and diastolic murmurs, pulmonary infarctions (which may result in cor pulmonale), chronic fatigue, unexplained dyspnea or dyspnea on exertion, hepatomegaly, jaundice, pallor, joint swelling, aching bones, chest pains, ischemic leg ulcers (especially around the ankles), and increased susceptibility to infection. Such symptoms usually don't develop until after age 6 months because large amounts of fetal Hb protect infants for the first few months after birth. Low socioeconomic status and related problems, such as poor nutrition and education, may delay diagnosis and supportive treatment. Infection, stress, dehydration, and conditions that provoke hypoxia— strenuous exercise, high altitude, unpressurized aircraft, cold, and vasoconstrictive drugs—may all provoke periodic crises. A painful crisis (vasoocclusive crisis, infarctive crisis), the most common crisis and the hallmark of the disease, usually appears periodically after age 5. It results from blood vessel obstruction by rigid, tangled sickle cells, which causes tissue anoxia and possible necrosis. This type of crisis is characterized by severe abdominal, thoracic, muscular, or bone pain and possibly worsening jaundice, dark urine, and a low-grade fever. Autosplenectomy, in which splenic damage and scarring is so extensive that the spleen shrinks and becomes impalpable, occurs in patients with longterm disease. This can lead to increased susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis, which can be fatal without prompt treatment. Infection may develop after the crisis subsides (in 4 days to several weeks), so watch for lethargy, sleepiness, fever, or apathy. An aplastic crisis (megaloblastic crisis) results from bone marrow depression and is associated with infection, usually viral. It's characterized by pallor, lethargy, sleepiness, dyspnea, possible coma, markedly decreased bone marrow activity, and RBC hemolysis. In infants between ages 8 months and 2 years, an acute sequestration crisis may cause sudden massive entrapment of RBCs in the spleen and liver. This rare crisis causes lethargy and pallor and, if untreated, commonly progresses to hypovolemic shock and death. A hemolytic crisis is quite rare and usually occurs in patients who also have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It probably results from complications of sickle cell anemia, such as infection, rather than from the disorder itself. Hemolytic crisis causes liver congestion and hepatomegaly as a result of degenerative changes. It worsens chronic jaundice, although increased jaundice doesn't always point to a hemolytic crisis. Suspect any of these crises in a sickle cell anemia patient with pale lips, tongue, palms, or nail beds; lethargy; listlessness; sleepiness with difficulty awakening; irritability; severe pain; a fever over 104° F (40° C); or a fever of 100° F (37.8° C) that persists for 2 days. Sickle cell anemia also causes long-term complications. Typically, the child is small for his age and has delayed puberty. (However, fertility isn't impaired.) If he reaches adulthood, his body build tends to be spiderlike — narrow shoulders and hips, long extremities, curved spine, barrel chest, and elongated skull. An adult usually has complications from organ infarction, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Premature death commonly results from infection or from repeated occlusion of small blood vessels and consequent infarction or necrosis of major organs (such as cerebral blood vessel occlusion causing stroke).\",\n",
              " 'Hemophilia': \"Hemophilia produces abnormal bleeding, which may be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the degree of factor deficiency. Mild hemophilia commonly goes undiagnosed until adulthood because the patient doesn't bleed spontaneously or after minor trauma but has prolonged bleeding if challenged by major trauma or surgery. Postoperative bleeding continues as a slow ooze or ceases and starts again, up to 8 days after surgery. Severe hemophilia causes spontaneous bleeding. In many cases, the first sign of severe hemophilia is excessive bleeding after circumcision. Later, spontaneous bleeding or severe bleeding after minor trauma may produce large subcutaneous and deep intramuscular hematomas. Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) and muscles causes pain, swelling, extreme tenderness and, possibly, permanent deformity. Moderate hemophilia causes symptoms similar to severe hemophilia but produces only occasional spontaneous bleeding episodes. Bleeding near peripheral nerves may cause peripheral neuropathy, pain, paresthesia, and muscle atrophy. If bleeding impairs blood flow through a major vessel, it can cause ischemia and gangrene. Pharyngeal, lingual, intracardial, intracerebral, and intracranial bleeding may all lead to shock and death.\",\n",
              " 'Fragile X syndrome': 'Small children may have relatively few identifiable physical characteristics; behavioral or learning difficulties may be the initial presenting features. Many adult male patients display a prominent jaw and forehead and a head circumference exceeding the 90th percentile. A long, narrow face with long or large ears that may be posteriorly rotated can be a helpful finding at all ages. Connective tissue abnormalities—including hyperextension of the fingers, a floppy mitral valve (in 80% of adults), and mild to severe pectus excavatum—have also been reported. Unusually large testes, found in most affected males after puberty, are an important identifying factor of the disorder. The average IQ of a person with fragile X syndrome is comparable to that of a person with Down syndrome; however, the behavioral characteristics are quite different. Hyperactivity, speech difficulties, language delay, and autistic-like behaviors may be attributed to other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and thus delay the diagnosis. About 50% of females with the FMR1 full mutation will have clinical symptoms, although the degree of severity and number of symptoms vary widely among females with fragile X syndrome. Those who are symptomatic typically have a much milder clinical presentation than males due to having an unaffected X chromosome in addition to the one with an FMR1 full mutation. Some degree of cognitive impairment is usually present in symptomatic females. Learning disabilities—math difficulties, language deficits, and attentional problems—are most common. Some females can have IQ scores in the mental retardation range. Although affected females can have autistic-like features, excessive shyness or social anxiety are the more common behavioral symptoms. Prominent ears and the connective tissue manifestations may be as significant as in males. Although males with the FMR1 permutation are asymptomatic, some female carriers of an FMR1 premutation can have associated symptoms. These symptoms include significantly earlier menopause and a low normal performance IQ.',\n",
              " 'Down syndrome': \"The physical signs of Down syndrome (especially hypotonia) as well as some dysmorphic facial features and heart defects may be apparent at birth. The degree of mental retardation may not become apparent until the infant grows older. People with Down syndrome typically have craniofacial anomalies, such as slanting, almond-shaped eyes with epicanthic folds; a flat face; a protruding tongue; a small mouth and chin; a single transverse palmar crease (simian crease); small white spots (Brushfield's spots) on the iris; strabismus; a small skull; a flat bridge across the nose; slow dental development, with abnormal or absent teeth; small ears; a short neck; and cataracts. Other physical effects may include dry, sensitive skin with decreased elasticity; umbilical hernia; short stature; short extremities, with broad, flat, and squarish hands and feet; clinodactyly (small little finger that curves inward); a wide space between the first and second toe; and abnormal fingerprints and footprints. Hypotonic limb muscles impair reflex development, posture, coordination, and balance. Congenital heart disease (septal defects or pulmonary or aortic stenosis), duodenal atresia, megacolon, and pelvic bone abnormalities are common. The incidence of leukemia and thyroid disorders (particularly hypothyroidism) may be increased. Frequent upper respiratory infections can be a serious problem. Genitalia may be poorly developed and puberty delayed. Females may menstruate and be fertile. Males are infertile with low serum testosterone levels; many have undescended testicles. Patients with Down syndrome may have an IQ between 30 and 70; however, social performance is usually beyond that expected for mental age and fewer than 10% will have severe mental retardation. The level of intellectual function depends greatly on the environment and the amount of early stimulation received in addition to the IQ.\",\n",
              " 'Trisomy 18 syndrome': 'Growth retardation begins in utero and remains significant after birth. Initial hypotonia may soon give way to hypertonia. Common findings include microcephaly and dolichocephaly, micrognathia, genital and perineal abnormalities (including imperforate anus), diaphragmatic hernia, and various renal defects. Congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels, and coarctation of the aorta, occur in 80% to 90% of patients and may be the cause of death in many infants. Other findings may include a short and narrow nose with upturned nares; unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate; low-set, slightly pointed ears; a short neck; a conspicuous clenched hand with overlapping fingers (usually seen on ultrasound as well); neural tube defects; omphalocele; cystic hygroma; choroid plexus cysts (also seen in some healthy infants); and oligohydramnios.',\n",
              " 'Trisomy 13 syndrome': 'Infants with trisomy 13 syndrome may present with microcephaly, varying degrees of holoprosencephaly, sloping forehead with wide sutures and fontanel, and a scalp defect at the vertex. Microophthalmia, cataracts, and other eye abnormalities are seen in most patients with full trisomy 13. Bilateral cleft lip with associated cleft palate is seen in at least 45% of patients. Most are born with a congenital heart defect, especially hypoplastic left heart, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, or dextroposition, which may significantly contribute significantly to the cause of death. Other possible findings include a flat and broad nose, low-set ears and inner ear abnormalities, polydactyly of the hands and feet, club feet, omphaloceles, neural tube defects, cystic hygroma, genital abnormalities, cystic kidneys, hydronephrosis, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Affected infants may also experience failure to thrive, seizures, apnea, and feeding difficulties.',\n",
              " \"Turner's syndrome\": \"Turner's syndrome produces obvious characteristic signs. At birth, 50% of infants with this syndrome measure below the third percentile in length. Commonly, they have swollen hands and feet, a wide chest, and a low hairline that becomes more obvious as they grow. They may have severe webbing of the neck, and some have coarse, enlarged, prominent ears. Gonadal dysgenesis is seen at birth. Other signs and symptoms include pigmented nevi, lymphedema, hypoplasia, or malformed nails. As the child grows, short stature is common. The patient may exhibit average to slightly below-average intelligence. Developmental problems include right-left disorientation for extrapersonal space and defective figure drawing. The patient is typically immature and socially naive. Auscultation of the infant's chest indicates cardiovascular malformations, such as coarctation of the aorta and ventricular septal defects.\",\n",
              " \"Klinefelter's syndrome\": \"Klinefelter's syndrome may not be apparent until puberty or later in mild cases. Because many of these patients aren't mentally retarded, behavioral problems in adolescence or infertility may be the only presenting features initially. The syndrome's characteristic features include a small penis and prostate gland, small testicles, sparse facial and abdominal hair, feminine distribution of pubic hair (triangular shape), sexual dysfunction (impotence, lack of libido) and, in fewer than 50% of patients, gynecomastia. Aspermatogenesis and infertility result from progressive sclerosis and hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules in the testicles and from testicular fibrosis during and after puberty. In the mosaic form of Klinefelter's syndrome, such pathologic changes and resulting infertility may be delayed. Klinefelter's syndrome may also be associated with osteoporosis, abnormal body build (long legs with short, obese trunk), tall stature, learning disabilities characterized by poor verbal skills and, in some individuals, behavioral problems beginning in adolescence. It's also associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary disease and varicose veins and a significantly increased rate of breast cancer because of the extra X chromosome.\",\n",
              " 'Velocardiofacial syndrome': \"Clinical features of VCFS vary greatly among affected persons. Neonates with complex heart malformations, dysmorphic features, hypocalcemia, missing thymus, and renal anomalies represent the severe end of the VCFS clinical presentation. On the other hand, the clinical features can be so mild that an affected parent isn't identified until an offspring is diagnosed and genetic testing is subsequently done on the parents. Symptoms have been reported in the cardiac, craniofacial, neuropsychological, renal, ocular, neurologic, skeletal, endocrine, immune, and hematologic systems. The most common symptoms can be classified as cardiac, craniofacial, and neuropsychological. Clinical studies indicate that 70% to 85% of persons with VCFS have cardiac anomalies, of which conotruncal defects (for example, tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosis) are the most common. This incidence may decrease over time as persons with only mild symptoms, such as learning difficulties in school or subtle dysmorphic features, are tested and found to be deletion positive. Craniofacial features include palatal abnormalities, dysmorphic facial features, and dysphagia usually due to velopharyngeal incompetence with or without pharyngoesophageal dysmotility. Therefore, feeding problems during infancy are common. The palate may be hypotonic and hypoplastic or have a midline cleft (ranging from bifid uvula to complete clefts of the palate). Related to palate problems are speech delays and abnormalities—particularly hypernasal speech and dyspraxia. Typical dysmorphic features include malformed ears, narrow palpebral fissures, hooded upper eyelids, ptosis, a broad square nasal root, a bulbous nasal tip (typically with a midline vertical crease), and micrognathia. Neuropsychological symptoms are present to some degree in most persons with VCFS. Hypotonia during the neonatal stage through early childhood period has been reported in more than 75% of cases. Even as hypotonia resolves with maturation, coordination and balance remain problematic. Cognitive symptoms, which can range from learning difficulties to varying levels of mental retardation, have been reported in over 80% of persons with VCFS. Children with VCFS typically have difficulties in visual-spatial activities, planning, attention, and concentration. Their strengths tend to be in rote verbal memory skills. Reading skills usually exceed math skills; however, reading comprehension tends to be problematic. The behavior of children with VCFS can be either shy and withdrawn or disinhibited and impulsive. Thought problems can be recognized during childhood and adolescence. Adults with VCFS are at risk for psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia.\",\n",
              " 'Neural tube defects': \"Spina bifida occulta is usually accompanied by a depression or dimple, tuft of hair, soft fatty deposits, port wine nevi, or a combination of these abnormalities on the skin over the spinal defect; however, such signs may be absent. Spina bifida occulta doesn't usually cause neurologic dysfunction but occasionally is associated with foot weakness or bowel and bladder disturbances. Such disturbances are especially likely during rapid growth phases, when the spinal cord's ascent within the vertebral column may be impaired by its abnormal adherence to other tissues. In both myelomeningocele and meningocele, a saclike structure protrudes over the spine. Like spina bifida occulta, meningocele seldom causes neurologic deficit. But myelomeningocele, depending on the level of the defect, causes permanent neurologic dysfunction, such as flaccid or spastic paralysis and bowel and bladder incontinence. Associated disorders include trophic skin disturbances (ulcerations, cyanosis), clubfoot, knee contractures, hydrocephalus (in about 90% of patients), and possibly mental retardation, Arnold-Chiari syndrome (in which part of the brain protrudes into the spinal canal), and curvature of the spine.\",\n",
              " 'Cleft lip and cleft palate': 'Orofacial cleft defects are divided into two major groups: cleft lip with or without cleft palate or cleft palate only. Cleft of the lip may involve the alveolus (premaxilla) and may extend through the palate (hard and soft). Congenital clefts of the face occur most commonly in the upper lip. They can range from a simple notch to a complete cleft from the lip edge, through the floor of the nostril and through the alveolus. Cleft lip can occur on either or both sides of the midline but rarely along the midline itself. A cleft lip involving only one side is a unilateral cleft lip, and a cleft on both sides of the midline is a bilateral cleft lip. When a bilateral cleft lip involves clefting of the alveolus on both sides of the premaxilla, the premaxilla is separated from the maxilla into a freely moving segment. A cleft of the palate only may be partial or complete, involving only the soft palate or extending from the soft palate completely through the hard palate. A cleft palate can occur alone or with a cleft lip. Isolated cleft palate is more commonly associated with congenital defects other than isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate. (See Variations of cleft lip and cleft palate.) The constellation of U-shaped cleft palate, mandibular hypoplasia, and glossoptosis is known as Pierre Robin syndrome, or Robin syndrome. Robin syndrome can occur as an isolated defect or one feature of many different syndromes; therefore, a comprehensive genetic evaluation is suggested for infants with Robin syndrome. Because of the mandibular hypoplasia and glossoptosis, careful evaluation and management of the airway are mandatory for infants with Robin syndrome.',\n",
              " 'Premenstrual syndrome': \"Clinical effects vary widely among patients and may include any combination of the following: behavioral—mild to severe personality changes, nervousness, hostility, irritability, agitation, sleep disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and depression somatic—breast tenderness or swelling, abdominal tenderness or bloating, joint pain, headache, edema, diarrhea or constipation, and exacerbations of skin problems (such as acne or rashes), respiratory problems (such as asthma), or neurologic problems (such as seizures). PMS may need to be differentiated from premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which is a more severe form of PMS that's marked by severe depression, irritability, and tension before menstruation. (See\",\n",
              " 'Dysmenorrhea': 'Dysmenorrhea produces sharp, intermittent, cramping, lower abdominal pain, which usually radiates to the back, thighs, groin, and vulva. Such pain—sometimes compared to labor pains—typically starts with or immediately before menstrual flow and peaks within 24 hours. Dysmenorrhea may also be associated with the characteristic signs and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (urinary frequency, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, chills, abdominal bloating, painful breasts, depression, and irritability).',\n",
              " 'Vulvovaginitis': 'In trichomonal vaginitis, vaginal discharge is thin, bubbly, green-tinged, and malodorous. This infection causes marked irritation and itching, and urinary symptoms, such as burning and frequency. Candidal vaginitis produces a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge and red, edematous mucous membranes, with white flecks adhering to the vaginal wall, and is often accompanied by intense itching. G. vaginalis produces a gray, foul, “fishy” smelling discharge. Acute vulvitis causes a mild to severe inflammatory reaction, including edema, erythema, burning, and pruritus. Severe pain on urination and dyspareunia may necessitate immediate treatment. Herpes infection may cause painful ulceration or vesicle formation during the active phase.',\n",
              " 'Ovarian cysts': \"Small ovarian cysts (such as follicular cysts) usually don't produce symptoms unless torsion or rupture causes signs of an acute abdomen (vomiting, abdominal tenderness, distention, and rigidity). Large or multiple cysts may induce mild pelvic discomfort, low back pain, dyspareunia, or abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to a disturbed ovulatory pattern. Ovarian cysts with torsion induce acute abdominal pain similar to that of appendicitis. Granulosa-lutein cysts that appear early in pregnancy may grow as large as 2″ to 2½″ (5 to 6 cm) in diameter and produce unilateral pelvic discomfort and, if rupture occurs, massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. In nonpregnant women, these cysts may cause delayed menses, followed by prolonged or irregular bleeding. Polycystic ovarian disease may also produce secondary amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or infertility.\",\n",
              " 'Polycystic ovary syndrome': 'Signs and symptoms of PCOS include mild pelvic discomfort, lower back pain, and dyspareunia caused by multiple ovarian cysts, abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to disturbed ovulatory pattern, hirsutism and male-pattern hair loss that result from abnormal patterns of estrogen secretion, obesity caused by abnormal hormone regulation, and acne caused by excess sebum production that results from disturbed androgen secretion.',\n",
              " 'Endometriosis': \"The classic symptom of endometriosis is acquired dysmenorrhea, which may produce constant pain in the lower abdomen and in the vagina, posterior pelvis, and back. This pain usually begins from 5 to 7 days before menses reaches its peak and lasts for 2 to 3 days. It differs from primary dysmenorrheal pain, which is more cramplike and concentrated in the abdominal midline. However, the pain's severity doesn't necessarily indicate the extent of the disease. Other clinical features depend on the location of the ectopic tissue: ovaries and oviducts: infertility and profuse menses ovaries or cul-de-sac: deep-thrust dyspareunia bladder: suprapubic pain, dysuria, hematuria small bowel and appendix: nausea and vomiting, which worsen before menses, and abdominal cramps cervix, vagina, and perineum: bleeding from endometrial deposits in these areas during menses. The primary complications of endometriosis are infertility and chronic pelvic pain.\",\n",
              " 'Uterine leiomyomas': \"Leiomyomas may be located within the uterine wall or may protrude into the endometrial cavity or from the serosal surface of the uterus. Most leiomyomas produce no symptoms. The most common symptom is abnormal bleeding, which typically presents clinically as menorrhagia. Uterine leiomyomas probably don't cause pain directly except when associated with torsion of a pedunculated subserous tumor. Pelvic pressure and impingement on adjacent viscera are common indications for treatment. Other symptoms may include urinary retention, constipation, or dyspareunia.\",\n",
              " 'Precocious puberty': 'The usual pattern of precocious puberty in females is a rapid growth spurt, thelarche (breast development), pubarche (pubic hair development), and menarche—all before age 9. These changes may occur independently or simultaneously.',\n",
              " 'Menopause': \"Many menopausal women are asymptomatic but some have severe symptoms. The decline in ovarian function and consequent decreased estrogen level produce menstrual irregularities: a decrease in the amount and duration of menstrual flow, spotting, and episodes of amenorrhea and polymenorrhea (possibly with hypermenorrhea). Irregularities may last a few months or persist for several years before menstruation ceases permanently. The following body system changes may occur (usually after the permanent cessation of menstruation): Reproductive system: Menopause may cause shrinkage of vulval structures and loss of subcutaneous fat, possibly leading to atrophic vulvitis; atrophy of vaginal mucosa and flattening of vaginal rugae, possibly causing bleeding after coitus or douching; vaginal itching and discharge from bacterial invasion; and loss of capillaries in the atrophying vaginal wall, causing the pink, rugal lining to become smooth and white. Menopause may also produce excessive vaginal dryness and dyspareunia due to decreased lubrication from the vaginal walls and decreased secretion from Bartholin's glands; smaller ovaries and oviducts; and progressive pelvic relaxation as the supporting structures lose their tone due to the absence of estrogen. ELDER TIP As a woman ages, atrophy causes the vagina to shorten and the mucous lining to become thin, dry, less elastic, and pale as a result of decreased vascularity. In addition, the pH of vaginal secretions increases, making the P 0 vaginal environment more alkaline. The type of flora also changes, increasing the older woman's chance of vaginal infections. Urinary system: Atrophic cystitis due to the effects of decreased estrogen levels on bladder mucosa and related structures may cause pyuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. Urethral carbuncles from loss of urethral tone and mucosal thinning may cause dysuria, meatal tenderness, and hematuria. Mammary system: Breast size decreases. Integumentary system: The patient may experience loss of skin elasticity and turgor due to estrogen deprivation, loss of pubic and axillary hair and, occasionally, slight alopecia. Autonomic nervous system: The patient may exhibit hot flashes and night sweats (in 75% of women), vertigo, syncope, tachycardia, dyspnea, tinnitus, emotional disturbances (irritability, nervousness, crying spells, fits of anger), and exacerbation of pre-existing depression, anxiety, and compulsive, manic, or schizoid behavior. Menopause may also induce atherosclerosis, and a decrease in estrogen level contributes to osteoporosis. Ovarian activity in younger women is believed to provide a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, and the loss of this function at menopause may partly explain the increased death rate from myocardial infarction in older women. Also, estrogen has been found to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\",\n",
              " 'Pelvic inflammatory disease': 'Clinical features of PID vary with the affected area but generally include a profuse, purulent vaginal discharge, sometimes accompanied by low \\x02grade fever and malaise (particu larly if gonorrhea is the cause). The patient experiences lower abdomen pain; movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexa may be extremely painful. Frequent, painful urination is also commonly reported. Additional signs and symptoms include irregular or absent menstruation, dyspareunia, low back pain, and nausea and vomiting.',\n",
              " 'Amenorrhea': \"Secondary amenorrhea can be diagnosed when a change is noted in a previously established menstrual pattern (absence of menstruation for 3 months). A thorough physical and pelvic examination rules out pregnancy, as well as anatomic abnormalities such as cervical stenosis that may cause false amenorrhea (cryptomenorrhea), in which menstruation occurs without external bleeding. Onset of menstruation within 1 week after administration of pure progestational agents, such as medroxyprogesterone and progesterone, indicates a functioning uterus. If menstruation doesn't occur, special diagnostic studies are appropriate. Blood and urine studies may reveal hormonal imbalances, such as lack of ovarian response to gonadotropins (elevated pituitary gonadotropins), failure of gonadotropin secretion (low pituitary gonadotropin levels), and abnormal thyroid levels. Tests for identification of dominant or missing hormones include cervical mucus ferning, vaginal cytologic examinations, basal body temperature, endometrial biopsy (during dilatation and curettage), urinary 17-ketosteroids, and plasma progesterone, testosterone, and androgen levels. A complete medical workup, including X-rays, laparoscopy, and a biopsy, may detect ovarian, adrenal, and pituitary tumors.\",\n",
              " 'Abnormal premenopausal bleeding': 'Bleeding not associated with abnormal pregnancy is usually painless, but it may be severely painful. When bleeding is associated with abnormal pregnancy, other symptoms include nausea, breast tenderness, bloating, and fluid retention. Severe or prolonged bleeding causes anemia, especially in patients with underlying disease such as blood dyscrasia and in patients receiving anticoagulants.',\n",
              " 'Dysfunctional uterine bleeding': 'DUB usually occurs as metrorrhagia (episodes of vaginal bleeding between menses); it may also occur as hypermenorrhea (heavy or prolonged menses, longer than 8 days) or chronic polymenorrhea (menstrual cycle of less than 18 days). Such bleeding is unpredictable and can cause anemia.',\n",
              " 'Postmenopausal bleeding': 'Vaginal bleeding, the primary symptom, ranges from spotting to outright hemorrhage; its duration also varies. Other symptoms depend on the cause. Excessive estrogen stimulation, for example, may also produce copious cervical mucus; estrogen deficiency may cause vaginal mucosa to atrophy.',\n",
              " 'Abortion': 'Prodromal signs of spontaneous abortion may include a pink discharge for several days or a scant brown discharge for several weeks before the onset of cramps and increased vaginal bleeding. For a few hours, the cramps intensify and occur more frequently; then the cervix dilates to expel uterine contents. If the entire contents are expelled, cramps and bleeding subside. However, if any contents remain, cramps and bleeding continue.',\n",
              " 'Ectopic pregnancy': 'Ectopic pregnancy sometimes produces symptoms of normal pregnancy or no symptoms other than mild abdominal pain, making diagnosis difficult. Characteristic clinical effects after fallopian tube implantation include amenorrhea or abnormal menses, followed by slight vaginal bleeding, and unilateral pelvic pain over the mass. Rupture of the tube causes life-threatening complications, including hemorrhage, shock, and peritonitis. The patient experiences sharp lower abdominal pain, possibly radiating to the shoulders and neck, often precipitated by activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as a bowel movement; she feels extreme pain upon motion of the cervix and palpation of the adnexa during a pelvic examination.',\n",
              " 'Hyperemesis gravidarum': 'The cardinal symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum are unremitting nausea and vomiting. The vomitus initially contains undigested food and mucus as well as small amounts of bile; later, only bile and mucus; and finally, blood and material that resembles coffee grounds. Persistent vomiting causes substantial weight loss and eventual emaciation. Associated effects may include pale, dry, waxy, and possibly jaundiced skin; subnormal or elevated temperature; rapid pulse; a fetid, fruity breath odor from acidosis; and central nervous system symptoms, such as confusion, delirium, headache, lassitude, stupor and, possibly, coma.',\n",
              " 'Gestational hypertension': 'Mild preeclampsia generally produces the following clinical effects: hypertension, proteinuria (less than 5 g/24 hours), generalized edema, and sudden weight gain of more than 3 lb (1.4 kg) per week during the second trimester or more than 1 lb (0.5 kg) a week during the third trimester. Severe preeclampsia is marked by increased hypertension and proteinuria, eventually leading to the development of oliguria. Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (the HELLP P 7 syndrome) is a severe variant. Other symptoms that may indicate worsening preeclampsia include blurred vision due to retinal arteriolar spasms, epigastric pain or heartburn, and severe frontal headache. In eclampsia, all the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia are magnified and are associated with seizures and, possibly, coma, premature labor, stillbirth, renal failure, and hepatic damage.',\n",
              " 'Hydatidiform mole': 'The early stages of a pregnancy in which a hydatidiform mole develops typically seem normal, except that the uterus may grow more rapidly than usual. The first obvious signs of trouble— absence of fetal heart tones, vaginal bleeding (from spotting to hemorrhage), and lower abdominal cramps—mimic those of spontaneous abortion. The blood may contain hydatid vesicles; hyperemesis is possible, and signs and symptoms of preeclampsia are also possible. Other complications of P 9 hydatidiform mole may include anemia, infection, trophoblast embolism, uterine rupture, and choriocarcinoma.',\n",
              " 'Placenta previa': \"Placenta previa usually produces painless third-trimester bleeding (often the first complaint). Various malpresentations occur because of the placenta's location and interfere with proper descent of the fetal head. P 0 (The fetus remains active, however, with good heart tones.) Complications of placenta previa include shock or maternal and fetal death.\",\n",
              " 'Abruptio placentae': 'Abruptio placentae produces a wide range of clinical effects, depending on the extent of placental separation and the amount of blood lost from maternal circulation. (See Degrees of placental separation in abruptio placentae, page 1192.) Mild abruptio placentae (marginal separation) develops gradually and produces mild to moderate bleeding, vague lower abdominal discomfort, mild to moderate abdominal tenderness, and uterine irritability. Fetal heart tones remain strong and regular. Moderate abruptio placentae (about 50% placental separation) may develop gradually or abruptly and produces continuous abdominal pain, moderate dark red vaginal bleeding, a tender uterus that remains firm between contractions, barely audible or irregular and bradycardiac fetal heart tones and, possibly, signs of shock. Labor usually starts within 2 hours and often proceeds rapidly.',\n",
              " 'Cardiovascular disease in pregnancy': 'Typical clinical features of cardiovascular disease during pregnancy include distended jugular veins, diastolic murmurs, moist basilar pulmonary crackles, cardiac enlargement (discernible on percussion or as a cardiac shadow on chest X-ray), and cardiac arrhythmias (other than sinus or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia). Other characteristic abnormalities may include cyanosis, pericardial friction rub, pulse delay, and pulsus alternans. P 4 Decompensation may develop suddenly or gradually, with persistent crackles at the lung bases. As it progresses, edema, increasing dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, a smothering sensation, and hemoptysis may occur.',\n",
              " 'Adolescent pregnancy': \"Clinical manifestations of adolescent pregnancy are the same as those of adult pregnancy (amenorrhea, nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, fatigue). However, the pregnant adolescent is much more likely to develop complications, such as poor weight gain during pregnancy, premature labor, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. In addition, the neonate is more likely to be of low birth weight. Some of these complications are related to the pregnant adolescent's physical immaturity, rapid growth, interest in fad diets, and generally poor nutrition; other complications may stem from the adolescent's need to deny her condition or to her ignorance of early signs of pregnancy, which often delays initiation of prenatal care.\",\n",
              " 'Diabetic complications during pregnancy': 'Indications for diagnostic screening for maternal diabetes mellitus during pregnancy include obesity, excessive weight gain, excessive hunger or thirst, polyuria, recurrent monilial infections, glycosuria, previous delivery of a large neonate, polyhydramnios, maternal hypertension, and a family history of diabetes.',\n",
              " 'Preterm labor': 'Like labor at term, preterm labor produces rhythmic uterine contractions, cervical dilation and effacement, possible rupture of the membranes, expulsion of the cervical mucus plug, and a bloody discharge.',\n",
              " 'Premature rupture of membranes': 'Typically, PROM causes blood-tinged amniotic fluid containing vernix particles to gush or leak from the vagina. Maternal fever, fetal tachycardia, and foul \\x02smelling vaginal discharge indicate infection.',\n",
              " 'Puerperal infection': \"A characteristic sign of puerperal infection is fever (at least 100.4° F [38° C]) that occurs in the first 24 hours in the first 9 days postpartum. This fever can spike as high as 105° F (40.6° C) and is commonly associated with chills, headache, malaise, restlessness, and anxiety. Abortion or miscarriage isn't usually associated with this infection and fever. Accompanying signs and symptoms depend on the infection's extent and site and may include: endometritis: heavy, sometimes foul- smelling lochia; tender, enlarged uterus; backache; severe uterine contractions persisting after childbirth parametritis (pelvic cellulitis): vaginal tenderness and abdominal pain and tenderness (pain may become more intense as infection spreads). The inflammation may remain localized, may lead to abscess formation, or may spread through the blood or lymphatic system. Widespread inflammation may cause: pelvic thrombophlebitis: severe, repeated chills and dramatic swings in body temperature; lower abdominal or flank pain; and, possibly, a palpable tender mass over the affected area, which usually develops near the second postpartum week femoral thrombophlebitis: pain, stiffness, or swelling in a leg or the groin; inflammation or shiny, white appearance of the affected leg; malaise; fever; and chills, usually beginning 10 to 20 days postpartum (these signs may precipitate pulmonary embolism) peritonitis: body temperature usually elevated, accompanied by tachycardia (greater than 140 beats/minute), weak pulse, hiccups, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; constant and possibly excruciating abdominal pain.\",\n",

The breast (or, occasionally, both breasts) becomes tender, hard, swollen, and warm. Unless mastitis is treated adequately, it may progress to breast abscess. Breast engorgement generally starts with onset of lactation (day 2 to day 5 postpartum). The breasts undergo changes similar to those in mastitis, and body temperature may be elevated. Engorgement may be mild, causing only slight discomfort, or severe, causing considerable pain. A severely engorged breast can interfere with the infant's capacity to feed because of his inability to position his mouth properly on the swollen, rigid breast.\",\n",
              " 'Galactorrhea': \"In the female with galactorrhea, milk continues to flow after the 21-day period that's normal after weaning. Galactorrhea may also be spontaneous and unrelated to normal lactation, or it may be caused by manual expression. Such abnormal flow is usually bilateral and may be accompanied by amenorrhea.\",\n",
              " 'Hyperbilirubinemia': \"The primary sign of hyperbilirubinemia is jaundice, which doesn't become clinically apparent until serum bilirubin levels reach about 7 mg/dl. Physiologic jaundice develops 24 hours after delivery in 50% of term neonates (usually day 2 to day 3) and 48 hours after delivery in 80% of premature neonates (usually day 3 to day 5). It generally disappears by day 7 in term neonates and by day 10 in premature neonates. Throughout physiologic jaundice, serum unconjugated bilirubin levels don't exceed 12 mg/dl. Pathologic jaundice may appear anytime after the first day of life and persists beyond 7 days with serum bilirubin levels greater than 12 mg/dl in a term neonate, 15 mg/dl in a premature neonate, or increasing more than 5 mg/dl in 24 hours.\",\n",
              " 'Erythroblastosis fetalis': \"Jaundice usually isn't present at birth but may appear as soon as 30 minutes later or within 24 hours. The mildly affected neonate shows mild to moderate hepatosplenomegaly and pallor. In severely affected neonates who survive birth, erythroblastosis fetalis usually produces pallor, edema, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, grunting respirations, pulmonary crackles, poor muscle tone, neurologic unresponsiveness, possible heart murmurs, a bilestained umbilical cord, and yellow or meconium-stained amniotic fluid. About 10% of untreated neonates develop kernicterus from hemolytic disease and show symptoms such as anemia, lethargy, poor sucking ability, retracted head, stiff limbs, squinting, a high-pitched cry, and seizures. Hydrops fetalis causes extreme hemolysis, fetal hypoxia, heart failure (with possible pericardial effusion and circulatory collapse), edema (ranging from mild peripheral edema to anasarca), peritoneal and pleural effusions (with dyspnea and pulmonary crackles), and green- or browntinged amniotic fluid (usually indicating a stillbirth). Other distinctive characteristics of the neonate with hydrops fetalis include enlarged placenta, marked pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, and ascites. Petechiae and widespread ecchymoses are present in severe cases, indicating concurrent disseminated intravascular coagulation. This disorder retards intrauterine growth, so the neonate's lungs, kidneys, brain, and thymus are small, and despite edema, his body size is smaller than that of neonates of comparable gestational age.\"}"
